| **[Short-term power load forecasting method based on CNN-SAEDN-Res](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07140v2)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep learning, the load data with non-temporal factors are difficult to process by sequence models. This problem results in insufficient precision of the prediction. Therefore, a short-term load forecasting method based on convolutional neural network (CNN), self-attention encoder-decoder network (SAEDN) and residual-refinement (Res) is proposed. In this method, feature extraction module is composed of a two-dimensional convolutional neural network, which is used to mine the local correlation between data and obtain high-dimensional data features. The initial load fore-casting module consists of a self-attention encoder-decoder network and a feedforward neural network (FFN). The module utilizes self-attention mechanisms to encode high-dimensional features. This operation can obtain the global correlation between data. Therefore, the model is able to retain important information based on the coupling relationship between the data in data mixed with non-time series factors. Then, self-attention decoding is per-formed and the feedforward neural network is used to regression initial load. This paper introduces the residual mechanism to build the load optimization module. The module generates residual load values to optimize the initial load. The simulation results show that the proposed load forecasting method has advantages in terms of prediction accuracy and prediction stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Ch...</summary><p>in Chinese language, Accepted by Electric Power Automation Equipment</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Prediction Model for NOx Emission of SCR System Based on Hybrid Data-driven Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01240v2)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming at the problem that delay time is difficult to determine and prediction accuracy is low in building prediction model of SCR system, a dynamic modeling scheme based on a hybrid of multiple data-driven algorithms was proposed. First, processed abnormal values and normalized the data. To improve the relevance of the input data, used MIC to estimate delay time and reconstructed production data. Then used combined feature selection method to determine input variables. To further mine data information, VMD was used to decompose input time series. Finally, established NOx emission prediction model combining ELM and EC model. Experimental results based on actual historical operating data show that the MAPE of predicted results is 2.61%. Model sensitivity analysis shows that besides the amount of ammonia injection, the inlet oxygen concentration and the flue gas temperature have a significant impact on NOx emission, which should be considered in SCR process control and optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Ch...</summary><p>in Chinese language, Accepted by Proceedings of the CSEE</p></details> |
| **[Randomized Spline Trees for Functional Data Classification: Theory and Application to Environmental Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07879v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional data analysis (FDA) and ensemble learning can be powerful tools for analyzing complex environmental time series. Recent literature has highlighted the key role of diversity in enhancing accuracy and reducing variance in ensemble methods.This paper introduces Randomized Spline Trees (RST), a novel algorithm that bridges these two approaches by incorporating randomized functional representations into the Random Forest framework. RST generates diverse functional representations of input data using randomized B-spline parameters, creating an ensemble of decision trees trained on these varied representations. We provide a theoretical analysis of how this functional diversity contributes to reducing generalization error and present empirical evaluations on six environmental time series classification tasks from the UCR Time Series Archive. Results show that RST variants outperform standard Random Forests and Gradient Boosting on most datasets, improving classification accuracy by up to 14\%. The success of RST demonstrates the potential of adaptive functional representations in capturing complex temporal patterns in environmental data. This work contributes to the growing field of machine learning techniques focused on functional data and opens new avenues for research in environmental time series analysis.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Weather-Informed Probabilistic Forecasting and Scenario Generation in Power Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07637v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into power grids presents significant challenges due to their intrinsic stochasticity and uncertainty, necessitating the development of new techniques for reliable and efficient forecasting. This paper proposes a method combining probabilistic forecasting and Gaussian copula for day-ahead prediction and scenario generation of load, wind, and solar power in high-dimensional contexts. By incorporating weather covariates and restoring spatio-temporal correlations, the proposed method enhances the reliability of probabilistic forecasts in RES. Extensive numerical experiments compare the effectiveness of different time series models, with performance evaluated using comprehensive metrics on a real-world and high-dimensional dataset from Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The results highlight the importance of weather information and demonstrate the efficacy of the Gaussian copula in generating realistic scenarios, with the proposed weather-informed Temporal Fusion Transformer (WI-TFT) model showing superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Bayesian Approaches and Expert Knowledge for Forecasting Continuous Glucose Monitoring Values in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07315v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise and timely forecasting of blood glucose levels is essential for effective diabetes management. While extensive research has been conducted on Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneity, underscoring the need for specialized blood glucose forecasting systems. This study introduces a novel blood glucose forecasting system, applied to a dataset of 100 patients from the ShanghaiT2DM study. Our study uniquely integrates knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches, leveraging expert knowledge to validate and interpret the relationships among diabetes-related variables and deploying the data-driven approach to provide accurate forecast blood glucose levels. The Bayesian network approach facilitates the analysis of dependencies among various diabetes-related variables, thus enabling the inference of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) trajectories in similar individuals with T2DM. By incorporating past CGM data including inference CGM trajectories, dietary records, and individual-specific information, the Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model effectively forecasts glucose levels across time intervals ranging from 15 to 60 minutes. Forecast results show a mean absolute error of 6.41 mg/dL, a root mean square error of 8.29 mg/dL, and a mean absolute percentage error of 5.28%, for a 15-minute prediction horizon. This study makes the first application of the ShanghaiT2DM dataset for glucose level forecasting, considering the influences of diabetes-related variables. Its findings establish a foundational framework for developing personalized diabetes management strategies, potentially enhancing diabetes care through more accurate and timely interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Anomaly Detection in In-Vehicle Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07505v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles are equipped with Electronic Control Units (ECU) that are used for controlling important vehicle functions including safety-critical operations. ECUs exchange information via in-vehicle communication buses, of which the Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is by far the most widespread representative. Problems that may occur in the vehicle's physical parts or malicious attacks may cause anomalies in the CAN traffic, impairing the correct vehicle operation. Therefore, the detection of such anomalies is vital for vehicle safety. This paper reviews the research on anomaly detection for in-vehicle networks, more specifically for the CAN bus. Our main focus is the evaluation of methods used for CAN bus anomaly detection together with the datasets used in such analysis. To provide the reader with a more comprehensive understanding of the subject, we first give a brief review of related studies on time series-based anomaly detection. Then, we conduct an extensive survey of recent deep learning-based techniques as well as conventional techniques for CAN bus anomaly detection. Our comprehensive analysis delves into anomaly detection algorithms employed in in-vehicle networks, specifically focusing on their learning paradigms, inherent strengths, and weaknesses, as well as their efficacy when applied to CAN bus datasets. Lastly, we highlight challenges and open research problems in CAN bus anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for Time Series Classification and Robust Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07314v3)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) has recently attracted significant attention as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Despite their theoretical appeal, KAN require validation on large-scale benchmark datasets. Time series data, which has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, especially univariate time series are naturally suited for validating KAN. Therefore, we conducted a fair comparison among KAN, MLP, and mixed structures. The results indicate that KAN can achieve performance comparable to, or even slightly better than, MLP across 128 time series datasets. We also performed an ablation study on KAN, revealing that the output is primarily determined by the base component instead of b-spline function. Furthermore, we assessed the robustness of these models and found that KAN and the hybrid structure MLP\_KAN exhibit significant robustness advantages, attributed to their lower Lipschitz constants. This suggests that KAN and KAN layers hold strong potential to be robust models or to improve the adversarial robustness of other models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figs |
| **[Semantic-Guided Multimodal Sentiment Decoding with Adversarial Temporal-Invariant Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00143v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to learn representations from different modalities to identify human emotions. However, existing works often neglect the frame-level redundancy inherent in continuous time series, resulting in incomplete modality representations with noise. To address this issue, we propose temporal-invariant learning for the first time, which constrains the distributional variations over time steps to effectively capture long-term temporal dynamics, thus enhancing the quality of the representations and the robustness of the model. To fully exploit the rich semantic information in textual knowledge, we propose a semantic-guided fusion module. By evaluating the correlations between different modalities, this module facilitates cross-modal interactions gated by modality-invariant representations. Furthermore, we introduce a modality discriminator to disentangle modality-invariant and modality-specific subspaces. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model. Our code is available at https://github.com/X-G-Y/SATI.</p></details> | <details><summary>chang...</summary><p>change Title, Authors, Abstract</p></details> |
| **[Surrogate uncertainty estimation for your time series forecasting black-box: learn when to trust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02834v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models play a vital role in time series forecasting. These models, however, often overlook an important element: point uncertainty estimates. Incorporating these estimates is crucial for effective risk management, informed model selection, and decision-making.To address this issue, our research introduces a method for uncertainty estimation. We employ a surrogate Gaussian process regression model. It enhances any base regression model with reasonable uncertainty estimates. This approach stands out for its computational efficiency. It only necessitates training one supplementary surrogate and avoids any data-specific assumptions. Furthermore, this method for work requires only the presence of the base model as a black box and its respective training data. The effectiveness of our approach is supported by experimental results. Using various time-series forecasting data, we found that our surrogate model-based technique delivers significantly more accurate confidence intervals. These techniques outperform both bootstrap-based and built-in methods in a medium-data regime. This superiority holds across a range of base model types, including a linear regression, ARIMA, gradient boosting and a neural network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Augmentation Policies from A Model Zoo for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06282v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting models typically rely on a fixed-size training set and treat all data uniformly, which may not effectively capture the specific patterns present in more challenging training samples. To address this issue, we introduce AutoTSAug, a learnable data augmentation method based on reinforcement learning. Our approach begins with an empirical analysis to determine which parts of the training data should be augmented. Specifically, we identify the so-called marginal samples by considering the prediction diversity across a set of pretrained forecasting models. Next, we propose using variational masked autoencoders as the augmentation model and applying the REINFORCE algorithm to transform the marginal samples into new data. The goal of this generative model is not only to mimic the distribution of real data but also to reduce the variance of prediction errors across the model zoo. By augmenting the marginal samples with a learnable policy, AutoTSAug substantially improves forecasting performance, advancing the prior art in this field with minimal additional computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[VE: Modeling Multivariate Time Series Correlation with Variate Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06169v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting relies on accurately capturing the correlations among variates. Current channel-independent (CI) models and models with a CI final projection layer are unable to capture these dependencies. In this paper, we present the variate embedding (VE) pipeline, which learns a unique and consistent embedding for each variate and combines it with Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to enhance forecasting performance while controlling parameter size. The VE pipeline can be integrated into any model with a CI final projection layer to improve multivariate forecasting. The learned VE effectively groups variates with similar temporal patterns and separates those with low correlations. The effectiveness of the VE pipeline is demonstrated through extensive experiments on four widely-used datasets. The code is available at: \url{https://github.com/swang-song/VE}.</p></details> |  |
| **[A statistical framework for analyzing shape in a time series of random geometric objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01984v3)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new framework to analyze shape descriptors that capture the geometric features of an ensemble of point clouds. At the core of our approach is the point of view that the data arises as sampled recordings from a metric space-valued stochastic process, possibly of nonstationary nature, thereby integrating geometric data analysis into the realm of functional time series analysis. Our framework allows for natural incorporation of spatial-temporal dynamics, heterogeneous sampling, and the study of convergence rates. Further, we derive complete invariants for classes of metric space-valued stochastic processes in the spirit of Gromov, and relate these invariants to so-called ball volume processes. Under mild dependence conditions, a weak invariance principle in $D([0,1]\times [0,\mathscr{R}])$ is established for sequential empirical versions of the latter, assuming the probabilistic structure possibly changes over time. Finally, we use this result to introduce novel test statistics for topological change, which are distribution-free in the limit under the hypothesis of stationarity. We explore these test statistics on time series of single-cell mRNA expression data, using shape descriptors coming from topological data analysis.</p></details> | revised version |
| **[Symmetry constrained neural networks for detection and localization of damage in metal plates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06084v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The present paper is concerned with deep learning techniques applied to detection and localization of damage in a thin aluminum plate. We used data generated on a tabletop apparatus by mounting to the plate four piezoelectric transducers, each of which took turn to generate a Lamb wave that then traversed the region of interest before being received by the remaining three sensors. On training a neural network to analyze time-series data of the material response, which displayed damage-reflective features whenever the plate guided waves interacted with a contact load, we achieved a model that detected with greater than 99% accuracy in addition to a model that localized with $3.14 \pm 0.21$ mm mean distance error and captured more than 60% of test examples within the diffraction limit. For each task, the best-performing model was designed according to the inductive bias that our transducers were both similar and arranged in a square pattern on a nearly uniform plate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Convolutional Autoencoder for Assessment of Drive-Cycle Anomalies in Connected Vehicle Sensor Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07592v3)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates a practical and novel method for automated unsupervised fault detection in vehicles using a fully convolutional autoencoder. The results demonstrate the algorithm we developed can detect anomalies which correspond to powertrain faults by learning patterns in the multivariate time-series data of hybrid-electric vehicle powertrain sensors. Data was collected by engineers at Ford Motor Company from numerous sensors over several drive cycle variations. This study provides evidence of the anomaly detecting capability of our trained autoencoder and investigates the suitability of our autoencoder relative to other unsupervised methods for automatic fault detection in this data set. Preliminary results of testing the autoencoder on the powertrain sensor data indicate the data reconstruction approach availed by the autoencoder is a robust technique for identifying the abnormal sequences in the multivariate series. These results support that irregularities in hybrid-electric vehicles' powertrains are conveyed via sensor signals in the embedded electronic communication system, and therefore can be identified mechanistically with a trained algorithm. Additional unsupervised methods are tested and show the autoencoder performs better at fault detection than outlier detectors and other novel deep learning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>SSCI2...</summary><p>SSCI2022, 7 pages, 3 Tables, 3 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Kernel-U-Net: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting using Custom Kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01479v3)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting task predicts future trends based on historical information. Transformer-based U-Net architectures, despite their success in medical image segmentation, have limitations in both expressiveness and computation efficiency in time series forecasting as evidenced in YFormer. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Kernel-U-Net, a flexible and kernel-customizable U-shape neural network architecture. The kernel-U-Net encoder compresses the input series into latent vectors, and its symmetric decoder subsequently expands these vectors into output series. Specifically, Kernel-U-Net separates the procedure of partitioning input time series into patches from kernel manipulation, thereby providing the convenience of customized executing kernels. Our method offers two primary advantages: 1) Flexibility in kernel customization to adapt to specific datasets; and 2) Enhanced computational efficiency, with the complexity of the Transformer layer reduced to linear. Experiments on seven real-world datasets, demonstrate that Kernel-U-Net's performance either exceeds or meets that of the existing state-of-the-art model in the majority of cases in channel-independent settings. The source code for Kernel-U-Net will be made publicly available for further research and application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Electricity Consumption with Random Walks on Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05934v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider time-series forecasting problems where data is scarce, difficult to gather, or induces a prohibitive computational cost. As a first attempt, we focus on short-term electricity consumption in France, which is of strategic importance for energy suppliers and public stakeholders. The complexity of this problem and the many levels of geospatial granularity motivate the use of an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs). Whilst GPs are remarkable predictors, they are computationally expensive to train, which calls for a frugal few-shot learning approach. By taking into account performance on GPs trained on a dataset and designing a random walk on these, we mitigate the training cost of our entire Bayesian decision-making procedure. We introduce our algorithm called \textsc{Domino} (ranDOM walk on gaussIaN prOcesses) and present numerical experiments to support its merits.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[AnomalyCD: A benchmark for Earth anomaly change detection with high-resolution and time-series observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05679v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various Earth anomalies have destroyed the stable, balanced state, resulting in fatalities and serious destruction of property. With the advantages of large-scale and precise observation, high-resolution remote sensing images have been widely used for anomaly monitoring and localization. Powered by the deep representation, the existing methods have achieved remarkable advances, primarily in classification and change detection techniques. However, labeled samples are difficult to acquire due to the low probability of anomaly occurrence, and the trained models are limited to fixed anomaly categories, which hinders the application for anomalies with few samples or unknown anomalies. In this paper, to tackle this problem, we propose the anomaly change detection (AnomalyCD) technique, which accepts time-series observations and learns to identify anomalous changes by learning from the historical normal change pattern. Compared to the existing techniques, AnomalyCD processes an unfixed number of time steps and can localize the various anomalies in a unified manner, without human supervision. To benchmark AnomalyCD, we constructed a high-resolution dataset with time-series images dedicated to various Earth anomalies (the AnomalyCDD dataset). AnomalyCDD contains high-resolution (from 0.15 to 2.39 m/pixel), time-series (from 3 to 7 time steps), and large-scale images (1927.93 km2 in total) collected globally Furthermore, we developed a zero-shot baseline model (AnomalyCDM), which implements the AnomalyCD technique by extracting a general representation from the segment anything model (SAM) and conducting temporal comparison to distinguish the anomalous changes from normal changes. AnomalyCDM is designed as a two-stage workflow to enhance the efficiency, and has the ability to process the unseen images directly, without retraining for each scene.</p></details> | <details><summary>remot...</summary><p>remote sensing benchmark</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing VarLiNGAM for Scalable and Efficient Time Series Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05500v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery is designed to identify causal relationships in data, a task that has become increasingly complex due to the computational demands of traditional methods such as VarLiNGAM, which combines Vector Autoregressive Model with Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model for time series data. This study is dedicated to optimising causal discovery specifically for time series data, which is common in practical applications. Time series causal discovery is particularly challenging due to the need to account for temporal dependencies and potential time lag effects. By designing a specialised dataset generator and reducing the computational complexity of the VarLiNGAM model from \( O(m^3 \cdot n) \) to \( O(m^3 + m^2 \cdot n) \), this study significantly improves the feasibility of processing large datasets. The proposed methods have been validated on advanced computational platforms and tested across simulated, real-world, and large-scale datasets, showcasing enhanced efficiency and performance. The optimised algorithm achieved 7 to 13 times speedup compared with the original algorithm and around 4.5 times speedup compared with the GPU-accelerated version on large-scale datasets with feature sizes between 200 and 400. Our methods aim to push the boundaries of current causal discovery capabilities, making them more robust, scalable, and applicable to real-world scenarios, thus facilitating breakthroughs in various fields such as healthcare and finance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDFlow: Anomaly Detection with NCDE-based Normalizing Flow for Advanced Driver Assistance System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05346v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For electric vehicles, the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is designed to assist braking based on driving conditions, road inclines, predefined deceleration strengths, and user braking patterns. However, the driving data collected during the development of ADAS are generally limited and lack diversity. This deficiency leads to late or aggressive braking for different users. Crucially, it is necessary to effectively identify anomalies, such as unexpected or inconsistent braking patterns in ADAS, especially given the challenge of working with unlabelled, limited, and noisy datasets from real-world electric vehicles. In order to tackle the aforementioned challenges in ADAS, we propose Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equation Normalizing Flow (GDFlow), a model that leverages Normalizing Flow (NF) with Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) to learn the distribution of normal driving patterns continuously. Compared to the traditional clustering or anomaly detection algorithms, our approach effectively captures the spatio-temporal information from different sensor data and more accurately models continuous changes in driving patterns. Additionally, we introduce a quantile-based maximum likelihood objective to improve the likelihood estimate of the normal data near the boundary of the distribution, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns. We validate GDFlow using real-world electric vehicle driving data that we collected from Hyundai IONIQ5 and GV80EV, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to six baselines across four dataset configurations of different vehicle types and drivers. Furthermore, our model outperforms the latest anomaly detection methods across four time series benchmark datasets. Our approach demonstrates superior efficiency in inference time compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Certificate Robustness for Time Series Classification with Efficient Self-Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02802v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the issue of adversarial robustness in the time series domain has garnered significant attention. However, the available defense mechanisms remain limited, with adversarial training being the predominant approach, though it does not provide theoretical guarantees. Randomized Smoothing has emerged as a standout method due to its ability to certify a provable lower bound on robustness radius under $\ell_p$-ball attacks. Recognizing its success, research in the time series domain has started focusing on these aspects. However, existing research predominantly focuses on time series forecasting, or under the non-$\ell_p$ robustness in statistic feature augmentation for time series classification~(TSC). Our review found that Randomized Smoothing performs modestly in TSC, struggling to provide effective assurances on datasets with poor robustness. Therefore, we propose a self-ensemble method to enhance the lower bound of the probability confidence of predicted labels by reducing the variance of classification margins, thereby certifying a larger radius. This approach also addresses the computational overhead issue of Deep Ensemble~(DE) while remaining competitive and, in some cases, outperforming it in terms of robustness. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance in robustness testing compared to baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, 4 tables, 10 pages</p></details> |
| **[TimelyGPT: Extrapolatable Transformer Pre-training for Long-term Time-Series Forecasting in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00817v3)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) such as BERT and GPT have recently achieved great success in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision domains. However, the development of PTMs on healthcare time-series data is lagging behind.This underscores the limitations of the existing transformer-based architectures, particularly their scalability to handle large-scale time series and ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. In this study, we present Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TimelyGPT). TimelyGPT employs an extrapolatable position (xPos) embedding to encode trend and periodic patterns into time-series representations. It also integrates recurrent attention and temporal convolution modules to effectively capture global-local temporal dependencies. We evaluated TimelyGPT on two large-scale healthcare time series datasets corresponding to continuous biosignals and irregularly-sampled time series, respectively. Our experiments show that during pre-training, TimelyGPT excels in learning time-series representations from continuously monitored biosignals and irregularly-sampled time series data commonly observed in longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). In forecasting continuous biosignals, TimelyGPT achieves accurate extrapolation up to 6,000 timesteps of body temperature during the sleep stage transition, given a short look-up window (i.e., prompt) containing only 2,000 timesteps. For irregularly-sampled time series, TimelyGPT with a proposed time-specific inference demonstrates high top recall scores in predicting future diagnoses using early diagnostic records, effectively handling irregular intervals between clinical records. Together, we envision TimelyGPT to be useful in a broad spectrum of health domains, including long-term patient health state forecasting and patient risk trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 17 pages |

However, coding algorithms for reliable fungal simulations have posed significant challenges for artists. This study equates fungal morphology simulation to a two-dimensional graphic time-series generation problem. We propose a zero-coding, neural network-driven cellular automaton. Fungal spread patterns are learned through an image segmentation model and a time-series prediction model, which then supervise the training of neural network cells, enabling them to replicate real-world spreading behaviors. We further implemented dynamic containment of fungal boundaries with lasers. Synchronized with the automaton, the fungus successfully spreads into pre-designed complex shapes in reality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Siggr...</summary><p>Siggraph Asia 2024 Art Paper</p></details> |
| **[Online Graph Topology Learning from Matrix-valued Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08020v4)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus is on the statistical analysis of matrix-valued time series, where data is collected over a network of sensors, typically at spatial locations, over time. Each sensor records a vector of features at each time point, creating a vectorial time series for each sensor. The goal is to identify the dependency structure among these sensors and represent it with a graph. When only one feature per sensor is observed, vector auto-regressive (VAR) models are commonly used to infer Granger causality, resulting in a causal graph. The first contribution extends VAR models to matrix-variate models for the purpose of graph learning. Additionally, two online procedures are proposed for both low and high dimensions, enabling rapid updates of coefficient estimates as new samples arrive. In the high-dimensional setting, a novel Lasso-type approach is introduced, and homotopy algorithms are developed for online learning. An adaptive tuning procedure for the regularization parameter is also provided. Given that the application of auto-regressive models to data typically requires detrending, which is not feasible in an online context, the proposed AR models are augmented by incorporating trend as an additional parameter, with a particular focus on periodic trends. The online algorithms are adapted to these augmented data models, allowing for simultaneous learning of the graph and trend from streaming samples. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generative Models for Lumped Rainfall-Runoff Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09904v3)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a novel generative modeling approach to rainfall-runoff modeling, focusing on the synthesis of realistic daily catchment runoff time series in response to catchment-averaged climate forcing. Unlike traditional process-based lumped hydrologic models that depend on predefined sets of variables describing catchment physical properties, our approach uses a small number of latent variables to characterize runoff generation processes. These latent variables encapsulate the intrinsic properties of a catchment and can be inferred from catchment climate forcing and discharge data. By sampling from the latent variable space, the model generates runoff time series that closely resemble real-world observations. In this study, we trained the generative models using neural networks on data from over 3,000 global catchments and achieved prediction accuracies comparable to current deep learning models and various conventional lumped models, both within the catchments from the training set and from other regions worldwide. This suggests that the runoff generation process of catchments can be effectively captured by a low-dimensional latent representation. Yet, challenges such as equifinality and optimal determination of latent variables remain. Future research should focus on refining parameter estimation methods and exploring the physical meaning of these latent dimensions to improve model applicability and robustness. This generative approach offers a promising alternative for hydrological modeling that requires minimal assumptions about the physical processes of the catchment.</p></details> |  |

Recently it has also found extensive applications in machine learning and data science as a mathematically principled, universal feature that boosts the performance of deep learning-based models in sequential data tasks. It, nevertheless, suffers from the curse of dimensionality when paths are high-dimensional. We propose a novel, trainable path development layer, which exploits representations of sequential data through finite-dimensional Lie groups, thus resulting in dimension reduction. Its backpropagation algorithm is designed via optimization on manifolds. Our proposed layer, analogous to recurrent neural networks (RNN), possesses an explicit, simple recurrent unit that alleviates the gradient issues. Our layer demonstrates its strength in irregular time series modelling. Empirical results on a range of datasets show that the development layer consistently and significantly outperforms signature features on accuracy and dimensionality. The compact hybrid model (stacking one-layer LSTM with the development layer) achieves state-of-the-art against various RNN and continuous time series models. Our layer also enhances the performance of modelling dynamics constrained to Lie groups. Code is available at https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Rare Temporal Pattern Mining in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05042v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data from various domains are increasing continuously. Extracting and analyzing the temporal patterns in these series can reveal significant insights. Temporal pattern mining (TPM) extends traditional pattern mining by incorporating event time intervals into extracted patterns, enhancing their expressiveness but increasing time and space complexities. One valuable type of temporal pattern is known as rare temporal patterns (RTPs), which occur rarely but with high confidence. There exist several challenges when mining rare temporal patterns. The support measure is set very low, leading to a further combinatorial explosion and potentially producing too many uninteresting patterns. Thus, an efficient approach to rare temporal pattern mining is needed. This paper introduces our Rare Temporal Pattern Mining from Time Series (RTPMfTS) method for discovering rare temporal patterns, featuring the following key contributions: (1) An end-to-end RTPMfTS process that takes time series data as input and yields rare temporal patterns as output. (2) An efficient Rare Temporal Pattern Mining (RTPM) algorithm that uses optimized data structures for quick event and pattern retrieval and utilizes effective pruning techniques for much faster mining. (3) A thorough experimental evaluation of RTPM, showing that RTPM outperforms the baseline in terms of runtime and memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2306.10994</p></details> |

In this study, we explore the integration of sleep measures from the previous night into wearable-based mood recognition. To this end, we propose NapTune, a novel prompt-tuning framework that utilizes sleep-related measures as additional inputs to a frozen pre-trained wearable time-series encoder by adding and training lightweight prompt parameters to each Transformer layer. Through rigorous empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the inclusion of sleep data using NapTune not only improves mood recognition performance across different wearable time-series namely ECG, PPG, and EDA, but also makes it more sample-efficient. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over the best baselines and unimodal variants. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of adding sleep-related measures on recognizing different moods as well as the influence of individual sleep-related measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICMI 2024</p></details> |

However, BP varies significantly across individuals, this inter-patient variability motivates the development of personalized models tailored to each patient's physiology. In this work, we propose a personalized BP forecasting model mainly using electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. This time-series model incorporates 2D representation learning to capture complex physiological relationships. Experiments are conducted on datasets collected from three diverse scenarios with BP measurements from 60 subjects total. Results demonstrate that the model achieves accurate and robust BP forecasts across scenarios within the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard criteria. This reliable early detection of abnormal fluctuations in BP is crucial for at-risk patients undergoing surgery or intensive care. The proposed model provides a valuable addition for continuous BP tracking to reduce mortality and improve prognosis.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

This approach has limitations, particularly in capturing the evolving nature of solar activity. Recognizing the limitations of traditional flare forecasting approaches, our research aims to uncover hidden relationships and the evolutionary characteristics of solar flares and their source regions. Our previously proposed Sliding Window Multivariate Time Series Forest (Slim-TSF) has shown the feasibility of usage applied on multivariate time series data. A significant aspect of this study is the comparative analysis of our updated Slim-TSF framework against the original model outcomes. Preliminary findings indicate a notable improvement, with an average increase of 5\% in both the True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Heidke Skill Score (HSS). This enhancement not only underscores the effectiveness of our refined methodology but also suggests that our systematic evaluation and feature selection approach can significantly advance the predictive accuracy of solar flare forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint accepted at the 26th International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery (DAWAK 2024)</p></details> |

This assumption frequently leads to inaccurate predictions when applied to real-world data. For example, evidence has shown that classical models overestimate the final pandemic size in the H1N1-2009 and COVID-19 outbreaks. To address this issue, we introduce individual mobility as a key factor in disease transmission and control. We characterize disease dynamics using mobility distribution functions for each compartment and propose a mobility-based compartmental model that incorporates population heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that, for the same basic reproduction number, our mobility-based model predicts a smaller final pandemic size compared to the classical models, effectively addressing the common overestimation problem. Additionally, we infer mobility distributions from the time series of the infected population. We provide sufficient conditions for uniquely identifying the mobility distribution from a dataset and propose a machine-learning-based approach to learn mobility from both synthesized and real-world data.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |

In this article, we employ randomised signature to introduce a generative model for financial time series data in the spirit of reservoir computing. Specifically, we propose a novel Wasserstein-type distance based on discrete-time randomised signatures. This metric on the space of probability measures captures the distance between (conditional) distributions. Its use is justified by our novel universal approximation results for randomised signatures on the space of continuous functions taking the underlying path as an input. We then use our metric as the loss function in a non-adversarial generator model for synthetic time series data based on a reservoir neural stochastic differential equation. We compare the results of our model to benchmarks from the existing literature.</p></details> | 33 pages |

It integrates integer-only quantization and Quantization-Aware Training with optimized hardware designs to realize 6-bit and 4-bit quantized Transformer models, which achieved precision comparable to 8-bit quantized models from related research. Utilizing a complete implementation on an embedded FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15), we examine the feasibility of deploying Transformer models on embedded IoT devices. This includes a thorough analysis of achievable precision, resource utilization, timing, power, and energy consumption for on-device inference. Our results indicate that while sufficient performance can be attained, the optimization process is not trivial. For instance, reducing the quantization bitwidth does not consistently result in decreased latency or energy consumption, underscoring the necessity of systematically exploring various optimization combinations. Compared to an 8-bit quantized Transformer model in related studies, our 4-bit quantized Transformer model increases test loss by only 0.63%, operates up to 132.33x faster, and consumes 48.19x less energy.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Video alignment using unsupervised learning of local and global features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06841v3)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle the problem of video alignment, the process of matching the frames of a pair of videos containing similar actions. The main challenge in video alignment is that accurate correspondence should be established despite the differences in the execution processes and appearances between the two videos. We introduce an unsupervised method for alignment that uses global and local features of the frames. In particular, we introduce effective features for each video frame by means of three machine vision tools: person detection, pose estimation, and VGG network. Then the features are processed and combined to construct a multidimensional time series that represent the video. The resulting time series are used to align videos of the same actions using a novel version of dynamic time warping named Diagonalized Dynamic Time Warping(DDTW). The main advantage of our approach is that no training is required, which makes it applicable for any new type of action without any need to collect training samples for it. Additionally, our approach can be used for framewise labeling of action phases in a dataset with only a few labeled videos. For evaluation, we considered video synchronization and phase classification tasks on the Penn action and subset of UCF101 datasets. Also, for an effective evaluation of the video synchronization task, we present a new metric called Enclosed Area Error(EAE). The results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, such as TCC, and other self-supervised and weakly supervised methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing methods over-rely on the indoor motion-capture spaces in which datasets were recorded, while simultaneously assuming continuous joint motion capture and uniform body dimensions. We propose EgoPoser to overcome these limitations with four main contributions. 1) EgoPoser robustly models body pose from intermittent hand position and orientation tracking only when inside a headset's field of view. 2) We rethink input representations for headset-based ego-pose estimation and introduce a novel global motion decomposition method that predicts full-body pose independent of global positions. 3) We enhance pose estimation by capturing longer motion time series through an efficient SlowFast module design that maintains computational efficiency. 4) EgoPoser generalizes across various body shapes for different users. We experimentally evaluate our method and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively while maintaining a high inference speed of over 600fps. EgoPoser establishes a robust baseline for future work where full-body pose estimation no longer needs to rely on outside-in capture and can scale to large-scale and unseen environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024, Code: https://siplab.org/projects/EgoPoser</p></details> |

Cryptocoins are tradable digital assets exchanged for specific trading prices. While history has shown the extreme volatility of such trading prices, the ability to efficiently model and forecast the time series resulting from the exchange price volatility remains an open research challenge. Good results can been achieved with state-of-the-art ML techniques, including Gradient-Boosting Machines (GBMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). CryptoAnalytics is a software toolkit to easily train these models and make inference on up-to-date cryptocoin trading price data, with facilities to fetch datasets from one of the main leading aggregator websites, i.e., CoinMarketCap, train models and infer the future trends.

This paper introduces a versatile and transferable digital ecosystem for managing time series data, designed to adhere to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). The system is highly adaptable, cloud-ready, and suitable for deployment in a wide range of settings, from small-scale projects to large-scale monitoring initiatives. The ecosystem comprises three core components: the Sensor Management System (SMS) for detailed metadata registration and management; time.IO, a platform for efficient time series data storage, transfer, and real-time visualization; and the System for Automated Quality Control (SaQC), which ensures data integrity through real-time analysis and quality assurance. The modular architecture, combined with standardized protocols and interfaces, ensures that the ecosystem can be easily transferred and deployed across different environments and institutions. This approach enhances data accessibility for a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, and the public, while fostering collaboration and advancing scientific research in environmental monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Liquid Resistance Liquid Capacitance Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08791v3)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce liquid-resistance liquid-capacitance neural networks (LRCs), a neural-ODE model which considerably improve the generalization, accuracy, and biological plausibility of electrical equivalent circuits (EECs), liquid time-constant networks (LTCs), and saturated liquid time-constant networks (STCs), respectively. We also introduce LRC units (LRCUs), as a very efficient and accurate gated RNN-model, which results from solving LRCs with an explicit Euler scheme using just one unfolding. We empirically show and formally prove that the liquid capacitance of LRCs considerably dampens the oscillations of LTCs and STCs, while at the same time dramatically increasing accuracy even for cheap solvers. We experimentally demonstrate that LRCs are a highly competitive alternative to popular neural ODEs and gated RNNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, on classic time-series benchmarks and a complex autonomous-driving lane-keeping task.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient and Generalizable Symbolic Regression Method for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03986v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis and prediction methods currently excel in quantitative analysis, offering accurate future predictions and diverse statistical indicators, but generally falling short in elucidating the underlying evolution patterns of time series. To gain a more comprehensive understanding and provide insightful explanations, we utilize symbolic regression techniques to derive explicit expressions for the non-linear dynamics in the evolution of time series variables. However, these techniques face challenges in computational efficiency and generalizability across diverse real-world time series data. To overcome these challenges, we propose \textbf{N}eural-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{Mo}nte-Carlo \textbf{T}ree \textbf{S}earch (NEMoTS) for time series. NEMoTS leverages the exploration-exploitation balance of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), significantly reducing the search space in symbolic regression and improving expression quality. Furthermore, by integrating neural networks with MCTS, NEMoTS not only capitalizes on their superior fitting capabilities to concentrate on more pertinent operations post-search space reduction, but also replaces the complex and time-consuming simulation process, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency and generalizability in time series analysis. NEMoTS offers an efficient and comprehensive approach to time series analysis. Experiments with three real-world datasets demonstrate NEMoTS's significant superiority in performance, efficiency, reliability, and interpretability, making it well-suited for large-scale real-world time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Space Energy-based Neural ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03845v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel family of deep dynamical models designed to represent continuous-time sequence data. This family of models generates each data point in the time series by a neural emission model, which is a non-linear transformation of a latent state vector. The trajectory of the latent states is implicitly described by a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE), with the initial state following an informative prior distribution parameterized by an energy-based model. Furthermore, we can extend this model to disentangle dynamic states from underlying static factors of variation, represented as time-invariant variables in the latent space. We train the model using maximum likelihood estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in an end-to-end manner, without requiring additional assisting components such as an inference network. Our experiments on oscillating systems, videos and real-world state sequences (MuJoCo) illustrate that ODEs with the learnable energy-based prior outperform existing counterparts, and can generalize to new dynamic parameterization, enabling long-horizon predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI forecasting of higher-order wave modes of spinning binary black hole mergers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03833v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a physics-inspired transformer model that predicts the non-linear dynamics of higher-order wave modes emitted by quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers. The model forecasts the waveform evolution from the pre-merger phase through the ringdown, starting with an input time-series spanning $ t \in [-5000\textrm{M}, -100\textrm{M}) $. The merger event, defined as the peak amplitude of waveforms that include the $l = |m| = 2$ modes, occurs at $ t = 0\textrm{M} $. The transformer then generates predictions over the time range $ t \in [-100\textrm{M}, 130\textrm{M}] $. We produced training, evaluation and test sets using the NRHybSur3dq8 model, considering a signal manifold defined by mass ratios $ q \in [1, 8] $; spin components $ s^z_{\{1,2\}} \in [-0.8, 0.8] $; modes up to $l \leq 4$, including the $(5,5)$ mode but excluding the $(4,0)$ and $(4,1)$ modes; and inclination angles $\theta \in [0, \pi]$. We trained the model on 14,440,761 waveforms, completing the training in 15 hours using 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs in the Delta supercomputer. We used 4 H100 GPUs in the DeltaAI supercomputer to compute, within 7 hours, the overlap between ground truth and predicted waveforms using a test set of 840,000 waveforms, finding that the mean and median overlaps over the test set are 0.996 and 0.997, respectively. Additionally, we conducted interpretability studies to elucidate the waveform features utilized by our transformer model to produce accurate predictions. The scientific software used for this work is released with this manuscript.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 1 appendix, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Practical Forecasting of Cryptocoins Timeseries using Correlation Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03674v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryptocoins (i.e., Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin) are tradable digital assets. Ownerships of cryptocoins are registered on distributed ledgers (i.e., blockchains). Secure encryption techniques guarantee the security of the transactions (transfers of coins among owners), registered into the ledger. Cryptocoins are exchanged for specific trading prices. The extreme volatility of such trading prices across all different sets of crypto-assets remains undisputed. However, the relations between the trading prices across different cryptocoins remains largely unexplored. Major coin exchanges indicate trend correlation to advise for sells or buys. However, price correlations remain largely unexplored. We shed some light on the trend correlations across a large variety of cryptocoins, by investigating their coin/price correlation trends over the past two years. We study the causality between the trends, and exploit the derived correlations to understand the accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting techniques for time series modeling (e.g., GBMs, LSTM and GRU) of correlated cryptocoins. Our evaluation shows (i) strong correlation patterns between the most traded coins (e.g., Bitcoin and Ether) and other types of cryptocurrencies, and (ii) state-of-the-art time series forecasting algorithms can be used to forecast cryptocoins price trends. We released datasets and code to reproduce our analysis to the research community.</p></details> |  |

However, often original data cannot be shared due to privacy concerns and regulations. A potential solution is to release a synthetic dataset with a similar distribution to the private dataset. Nevertheless, in some scenarios, the attributes required to train an AI model are distributed among different parties, and the parties cannot share the local data for synthetic data construction due to privacy regulations. In PETS 2024, we recently introduced the first Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network (VFLGAN) for publishing vertically partitioned static data. However, VFLGAN cannot effectively handle time-series data, presenting both temporal and attribute dimensions. In this article, we proposed VFLGAN-TS, which combines the ideas of attribute discriminator and vertical federated learning to generate synthetic time-series data in the vertically partitioned scenario. The performance of VFLGAN-TS is close to that of its counterpart, which is trained in a centralized manner and represents the upper limit for VFLGAN-TS. To further protect privacy, we apply a Gaussian mechanism to make VFLGAN-TS satisfy an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. Besides, we develop an enhanced privacy auditing scheme to evaluate the potential privacy breach through the framework of VFLGAN-TS and synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSFool: Crafting Highly-Imperceptible Adversarial Time Series through Multi-Objective Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06388v4)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of recurrent neural network (RNN) models in time series classification (TSC). However, neural networks (NNs) are vulnerable to adversarial samples, which cause real-life adversarial attacks that undermine the robustness of AI models. To date, most existing attacks target at feed-forward NNs and image recognition tasks, but they cannot perform well on RNN-based TSC. This is due to the cyclical computation of RNN, which prevents direct model differentiation. In addition, the high visual sensitivity of time series to perturbations also poses challenges to local objective optimization of adversarial samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient method called TSFool to craft highly-imperceptible adversarial time series for RNN-based TSC. The core idea is a new global optimization objective known as "Camouflage Coefficient" that captures the imperceptibility of adversarial samples from the class distribution. Based on this, we reduce the adversarial attack problem to a multi-objective optimization problem that enhances the perturbation quality. Furthermore, to speed up the optimization process, we propose to use a representation model for RNN to capture deeply embedded vulnerable samples whose features deviate from the latent manifold. Experiments on 11 UCR and UEA datasets showcase that TSFool significantly outperforms six white-box and three black-box benchmark attacks in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and imperceptibility from various perspectives including standard measure, human study and real-world defense.</p></details> | <details><summary>27th ...</summary><p>27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI'24)</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable mixture of experts for time series prediction under recurrent and non-recurrent conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03282v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-recurrent conditions caused by incidents are different from recurrent conditions that follow periodic patterns. Existing traffic speed prediction studies are incident-agnostic and use one single model to learn all possible patterns from these drastically diverse conditions. This study proposes a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to improve traffic speed prediction under two separate conditions, recurrent and non-recurrent (i.e., with and without incidents). The MoE leverages separate recurrent and non-recurrent expert models (Temporal Fusion Transformers) to capture the distinct patterns of each traffic condition. Additionally, we propose a training pipeline for non-recurrent models to remedy the limited data issues. To train our model, multi-source datasets, including traffic speed, incident reports, and weather data, are integrated and processed to be informative features. Evaluations on a real road network demonstrate that the MoE achieves lower errors compared to other benchmark algorithms. The model predictions are interpreted in terms of temporal dependencies and variable importance in each condition separately to shed light on the differences between recurrent and non-recurrent conditions.</p></details> |  |

After collecting the performance characteristics of various mobile devices, the device performance profile was fitted by using PCA (principal component analysis) dimensionality reduction and feature engineering methods such as descriptive time series analysis. The ability of performance features and profiles to describe the real-time performance status of devices was understood and studied by applying the TOPSIS method and multi-level weighting processing. A time series model was constructed for the feature set under objective weighting, and multiple sensitivity (real-time, short-term, long-term) performance status perception results were provided to obtain real-time performance evaluation data and long-term stable performance prediction data. Finally, by configuring dynamic AB experiments and overlaying fine-grained power reduction strategies, the usability of the method was verified, and the accuracy of device performance status identification and prediction was compared with the performance of the profile features including dimensionality reduction time series modeling, TOPSIS method and entropy weighting method, subjective weighting, HMA method. The results show that accurate real-time performance perception results can greatly enhance business value, and this research has application effectiveness and certain forward-looking significance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Prediction of COPD Using Machine Learning, Clinical Summary Notes, and Vital Signs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13958v2)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. In the United States, more than 15.7 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, with 96% of individuals living with at least one other chronic health condition. It is the 4th leading cause of death in the country. Over 2.2 million patients are admitted to hospitals annually due to COPD exacerbations. Monitoring and predicting patient exacerbations on-time could save their life. This paper presents two different predictive models to predict COPD exacerbation using AI and natural language processing (NLP) approaches. These models use respiration summary notes, symptoms, and vital signs. To train and test these models, data records containing physiologic signals and vital signs time series were used. These records were captured from patient monitors and comprehensive clinical data obtained from hospital medical information systems for tens of thousands of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. We achieved an area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.82 in detection and prediction of COPD exacerbation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Explanation Space: A New Perspective into Time Series Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01354v2)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human understandable explanation of deep learning models is necessary for many critical and sensitive applications. Unlike image or tabular data where the importance of each input feature (for the classifier's decision) can be directly projected into the input, time series distinguishable features (e.g. dominant frequency) are often hard to manifest in time domain for a user to easily understand. Moreover, most explanation methods require a baseline value as an indication of the absence of any feature. However, the notion of lack of feature, which is often defined as black pixels for vision tasks or zero/mean values for tabular data, is not well-defined in time series. Despite the adoption of explainable AI methods (XAI) from tabular and vision domain into time series domain, these differences limit the application of these XAI methods in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method that allows a model originally trained on time domain to be interpreted in other explanation spaces using existing methods. We suggest four explanation spaces that each can potentially alleviate these issues in certain types of time series. Our method can be readily adopted in existing platforms without any change to trained models or XAI methods. The code is available at https://github.com/shrezaei/TS-X-spaces.</p></details> |  |

A key advantage of MGP is providing uncertainty quantification for prediction, which is highly important for subsequent decision-making tasks. However, traditional MGP may not be sufficiently flexible to handle multivariate data with dynamic characteristics, particularly when dealing with complex temporal correlations. Additionally, since some outputs may lack correlation, transferring information among them may lead to negative transfer. To address these issues, this study proposes a non-stationary MGP model that can capture both the dynamic and sparse correlation among outputs. Specifically, the covariance functions of MGP are constructed using convolutions of time-varying kernel functions. Then a dynamic spike-and-slab prior is placed on correlation parameters to automatically decide which sources are informative to the target output in the training process. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for efficient model fitting. Both numerical studies and a real case demonstrate its efficacy in capturing dynamic and sparse correlation structure and mitigating negative transfer for high-dimensional time-series data. Finally, a mountain-car reinforcement learning case highlights its potential application in decision making problems.</p></details> |  |

However, managing heterogeneous and intermittent resources to support machine/deep learning (ML/DL) based workflows poses challenges in resource governance for reliability, and confidentiality for model/data privacy protection. There is a need for approaches to handle the volatility of volunteer edge node availability, and also to scale the confidential data-intensive workflow execution across a large number of VEC nodes. In this paper, we present VECA, a reliable and confidential VEC resource clustering solution featuring three-fold methods tailored for executing ML/DL-based scientific workflows on VEC resources. Firstly, a capacity-based clustering approach enhances system reliability and minimizes VEC node search latency. Secondly, a novel two-phase, globally distributed scheduling scheme optimizes job allocation based on node attributes and using time-series-based Recurrent Neural Networks. Lastly, the integration of confidential computing ensures privacy preservation of the scientific workflows, where model and data information are not shared with VEC resources providers. We evaluate VECA in a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud testbed that features OpenFaaS and MicroK8S to support two ML/DL-based scientific workflows viz., G2P-Deep (bioinformatics) and PAS-ML (health informatics). Results from tested experiments demonstrate that our proposed VECA approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods; especially VECA exhibits a two-fold reduction in VEC node search latency and over 20% improvement in productivity rates following execution failures compared to the next best method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted - IC2E 2024 Conference</p></details> |

State-of-the-art architectures, while producing promising results on the UCR and the UEA archives , present a high number of trainable parameters. This can lead to long training with high CO2 emission, power consumption and possible increase in the number of FLoating-point Operation Per Second (FLOPS). In this paper, we present a new architecture for TSC, the Light Inception with boosTing tEchnique (LITE) with only 2.34% of the number of parameters of the state-of-the-art InceptionTime model, while preserving performance. This architecture, with only 9, 814 trainable parameters due to the usage of DepthWise Separable Convolutions (DWSC), is boosted by three techniques: multiplexing, custom filters, and dilated convolution. The LITE architecture, trained on the UCR, is 2.78 times faster than InceptionTime and consumes 2.79 times less CO2 and power. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture on multivariate time series data, we adapt LITE to handle multivariate time series, we call this version LITEMV. To bring theory into application, we also conducted experiments using LITEMV on multivariate time series representing human rehabilitation movements, showing that LITEMV not only is the most efficient model but also the best performing for this application on the Kimore dataset, a skeleton based human rehabilitation exercises dataset. Moreover, to address the interpretability of LITEMV, we present a study using Class Activation Maps to understand the classification decision taken by the model during evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) has emerged as a promising technique to mitigate volatility by decomposing data into distinct modes, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy. In this study, we integrate VMD with linear models to develop a robust forecasting framework. Our approach is evaluated on 13 diverse datasets, including ETTm2, WindTurbine, M4, and 10 air quality datasets from various Southeast Asian cities. The effectiveness of the VMD strategy is assessed by comparing Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values from models utilizing VMD against those without it. Additionally, we benchmark linear-based models against well-known neural network architectures such as LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and RNN. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in RMSE across nearly all models following VMD application. Notably, the Linear + VMD model achieved the lowest average RMSE in univariate forecasting at 0.619. In multivariate forecasting, the DLinear + VMD model consistently outperformed others, attaining the lowest RMSE across all datasets with an average of 0.019. These findings underscore the effectiveness of combining VMD with linear models for superior time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For associated repository, see https://github.com/Espalemit/VMD-With-LTSF-Linear.git</p></details> |

The approach utilizes a mixed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to predict monthly accumulations of daily detected fire spots. A summary of the data revealed a consistent seasonality over time, with annual maximum and minimum fire spot values tending to repeat at the same periods each year. The primary objective is to verify whether the forecasts capture this inherent seasonality through rigorous statistical analysis. The methodology involved careful data preparation, model configuration, and training using cross-validation with two seeds, ensuring that the data generalizes well to the test and validation sets, and confirming the convergence of the model parameters. The results indicate that the mixed LSTM and GRU model offers improved accuracy in forecasting 12 months ahead, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal patterns and modeling the observed time series. This research significantly contributes to the application of deep learning techniques in environmental monitoring, specifically in fire spot forecasting. In addition to improving forecast accuracy, the proposed approach highlights the potential for adaptation to other time series forecasting challenges, opening new avenues for research and development in machine learning and natural phenomenon prediction.

This paper presents a novel synthetic dataset designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in interpreting various forms of data visualizations, including plots like time series, histograms, violins, boxplots, and clusters. Our dataset is generated using controlled parameters to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential real-world scenarios. We employ multimodal text prompts with questions related to visual data in images to benchmark several state-of-the-art models like ChatGPT or Gemini, assessing their understanding and interpretative accuracy. To ensure data integrity, our benchmark dataset is generated automatically, making it entirely new and free from prior exposure to the models being tested. This strategy allows us to evaluate the models' ability to truly interpret and understand the data, eliminating possibility of pre-learned responses, and allowing for an unbiased evaluation of the models' capabilities. We also introduce quantitative metrics to assess the performance of the models, providing a robust and comprehensive evaluation tool. Benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs with this dataset reveals varying degrees of success, highlighting specific strengths and weaknesses in interpreting diverse types of visual data. The results provide valuable insights into the current capabilities of LLMs and identify key areas for improvement. This work establishes a foundational benchmark for future research and development aimed at enhancing the visual interpretative abilities of language models. In the future, improved LLMs with robust visual interpretation skills can significantly aid in automated data analysis, scientific research, educational tools, and business intelligence applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[In the Search for Optimal Multi-view Learning Models for Crop Classification with Global Remote Sensing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16582v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studying and analyzing cropland is a difficult task due to its dynamic and heterogeneous growth behavior. Usually, diverse data sources can be collected for its estimation. Although deep learning models have proven to excel in the crop classification task, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple inputs, named Multi-View Learning (MVL). The methods used in the MVL scenario can be structured based on the encoder architecture, the fusion strategy, and the optimization technique. The literature has primarily focused on using specific encoder architectures for local regions, lacking a deeper exploration of other components in the MVL methodology. In contrast, we investigate the simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and encoder architecture, assessing global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoders (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible configurations in the MVL method. We use the CropHarvest dataset for validation, which provides optical, radar, weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all the cases. Instead, a specialized combination should be meticulously sought, including an encoder and fusion strategy. To streamline this search process, we suggest identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy, and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a methodological framework for researchers exploring crop classification through an MVL methodology.</p></details> | submitted to journal |
| **[Test-time data augmentation: improving predictions of recurrent neural network models of composites](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02478v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have emerged as an interesting alternative to conventional material modeling approaches, particularly for nonlinear path dependent materials. Remarkable computational enhancements are obtained using RNNs compared to classical approaches such as the computational homogenization method. However, RNN predictive errors accumulate, leading to issues when predicting temporal dependencies in time series data. This study aims to address and mitigate inaccuracies induced by neural networks in predicting path dependent plastic deformations of short fiber reinforced composite materials. We propose using an approach of Test Time data Augmentation (TTA), which, to the best of the authors knowledge, is previously untested in the context of RNNs. The method is based on augmenting the input test data using random rotations and subsequently rotating back the predicted output signal. By aggregating the back rotated predictions, a more accurate prediction compared to individual predictions is obtained. Our analysis also demonstrates improved shape consistency between the prediction and the target pseudo time signal. Additionally, this method provides an uncertainty estimation which correlates with the absolute prediction error. The TTA approach is reproducible with different randomly generated data augmentations, establishing a promising framework for optimizing predictions of deep learning models. We believe there are broader implications of the proposed method for various fields reliant on accurate predictive data driven modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeDiT: General-purpose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02322v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent advances in building foundation models for texts and video data, there is a surge of interest in foundation models for time series. A family of models have been developed, utilizing a temporal auto-regressive generative Transformer architecture, whose effectiveness has been proven in Large Language Models. While the empirical results are promising, almost all existing time series foundation models have only been tested on well-curated ``benchmark'' datasets very similar to texts. However, real-world time series exhibit unique challenges, such as variable channel sizes across domains, missing values, and varying signal sampling intervals due to the multi-resolution nature of real-world data. Additionally, the uni-directional nature of temporally auto-regressive decoding limits the incorporation of domain knowledge, such as physical laws expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs). To address these challenges, we introduce the Time Diffusion Transformer (TimeDiT), a general foundation model for time series that employs a denoising diffusion paradigm instead of temporal auto-regressive generation. TimeDiT leverages the Transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies and employs diffusion processes to generate high-quality candidate samples without imposing stringent assumptions on the target distribution via novel masking schemes and a channel alignment strategy. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning-free model editing strategy that allows the seamless integration of external knowledge during the sampling process without updating any model parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on a varity of tasks such as forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of TimeDiT.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, 6 Figures, 11 Tables.

Additionally, outside of entropy and information theory, permutations have recently been leveraged as a graph representation, which opens the door for graph theory tools and analysis. Despite the successful application of permutations in a variety of scientific domains, permutations requires a judicious choice of the delay parameter $\tau$ and dimension $n$. However, $n$ is typically selected within an accepted range giving optimal results for the majority of systems. Therefore, in this work we focus on choosing the delay parameter, while giving some general guidance on the appropriate selection of $n$ based on a statistical analysis of the permutation distribution. Selecting $\tau$ is often accomplished using trial and error guided by the expertise of domain scientists. However, in this paper, we show how persistent homology, a commonly used tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), provides methods for the automatic selection of $\tau$. We evaluate the successful identification of a suitable $\tau$ from our TDA-based approach by comparing our results to both expert suggested parameters from published literature and optimized parameters (if possible) for a wide variety of dynamical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added Max M.

Using data from a real-world maternal health program, we demonstrate how a cognitive model based on Instance-Based Learning (IBL) Theory can augment existing purely computational approaches. Our findings show that, compared to general time-series forecasters (e.g., LSTMs), IBL models, which reflect human decision-making processes, better predict the dynamics of individuals' states. Additionally, IBL provides estimates of the volatility in individuals' states and their sensitivity to interventions, which can improve the efficiency of training of other time series models.</p></details> |  |

While significant progress has been made in this area, fully capturing and leveraging spatiotemporal heterogeneity remains a fundamental challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning scheme. Specifically, our approach implicitly captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity through learning spatial and temporal embeddings, which can be viewed as a clustering process. Then, a novel spatiotemporal meta-parameter learning paradigm is proposed to learn spatiotemporal-specific parameters from meta-parameter pools, which is informed by the captured heterogeneity. Based on these ideas, we develop a Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-Network (HimNet) for spatiotemporal time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting superior interpretability.

It has experienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in capturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning architectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive understanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving both accuracy and explainability in traffic prediction models remains a challenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Traffic flow Prediction model based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate explainable traffic predictions, named xTP-LLM. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, xTP-LLM captures complex time-series patterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM framework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, xTP-LLM shows competitive accuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing an intuitive and reliable explanation for predictions. This paper contributes to advancing explainable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use LLM for explainable prediction of traffic flows.</p></details> | 31pages, 16 figures |

Honeypots, which are decoy systems designed to lure and interact with attackers, have emerged as a critical component in cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to creating realistic and interactive honeypot systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning a pre-trained open-source language model on a diverse dataset of attacker-generated commands and responses, we developed a honeypot capable of sophisticated engagement with attackers. Our methodology involved several key steps: data collection and processing, prompt engineering, model selection, and supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model's performance. Evaluation through similarity metrics and live deployment demonstrated that our approach effectively generates accurate and informative responses. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to revolutionize honeypot technology, providing cybersecurity professionals with a powerful tool to detect and analyze malicious activity, thereby enhancing overall security infrastructure.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating presidential debate performances using LLMs, addressing the longstanding challenge of objectively assessing debate outcomes. We propose a framework that analyzes candidates' "Policies, Persona, and Perspective" (3P) and how they resonate with the "Interests, Ideologies, and Identity" (3I) of four key audience groups: voters, businesses, donors, and politicians. Our method employs large language models to generate the LLM-POTUS Score, a quantitative measure of debate performance based on the alignment between 3P and 3I. We apply this framework to analyze transcripts from recent U.S. presidential debates, demonstrating its ability to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional assessments of candidate performances. Our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of different debating strategies and their impact on various audience segments. This study not only offers a new tool for political analysis but also explores the potential and limitations of using LLMs as impartial judges in complex social contexts. In addition, this framework provides individual citizens with an independent tool to evaluate presidential debate performances, which enhances democratic engagement and reduces reliance on potentially biased media interpretations and institutional influence, thereby strengthening the foundation of informed civic participation.</p></details> |  |

However, scaling up model sizes results in exponentially higher computational costs and energy consumption, making these models impractical for academic researchers and businesses with limited resources. At the same time, Small Models (SMs) are frequently used in practical settings, although their significance is currently underestimated. This raises important questions about the role of small models in the era of LLMs, a topic that has received limited attention in prior research. In this work, we systematically examine the relationship between LLMs and SMs from two key perspectives: Collaboration and Competition. We hope this survey provides valuable insights for practitioners, fostering a deeper understanding of the contribution of small models and promoting more efficient use of computational resources.

In response, we introduce iLLuMinaTE, a zero-shot, chain-of-prompts LLM-XAI pipeline inspired by Miller's cognitive model of explanation. iLLuMinaTE is designed to deliver theory-driven, actionable feedback to students in online courses. iLLuMinaTE navigates three main stages - causal connection, explanation selection, and explanation presentation - with variations drawing from eight social science theories (e.g. Abnormal Conditions, Pearl's Model of Explanation, Necessity and Robustness Selection, Contrastive Explanation). We extensively evaluate 21,915 natural language explanations of iLLuMinaTE extracted from three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B, Llama3-70B), with three different underlying XAI methods (LIME, Counterfactuals, MC-LIME), across students from three diverse online courses. Our evaluation involves analyses of explanation alignment to the social science theory, understandability of the explanation, and a real-world user preference study with 114 university students containing a novel actionability simulation. We find that students prefer iLLuMinaTE explanations over traditional explainers 89.52% of the time. Our work provides a robust, ready-to-use framework for effectively communicating hybrid XAI-driven insights in education, with significant generalization potential for other human-centric fields.</p></details> |  |

Lay People can Distinguish Large Language Models from Lawyers, but still Favour Advice from an LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07871v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are seemingly infiltrating every domain, and the legal context is no exception. In this paper, we present the results of three experiments (total N=288) that investigated lay people's willingness to act upon, and their ability to discriminate between, LLM- and lawyer-generated legal advice. In Experiment 1, participants judged their willingness to act on legal advice when the source of the advice was either known or unknown. When the advice source was unknown, participants indicated that they were significantly more willing to act on the LLM-generated advice. This result was replicated in Experiment 2. Intriguingly, despite participants indicating higher willingness to act on LLM-generated advice in Experiments 1 and 2, participants discriminated between the LLM- and lawyer-generated texts significantly above chance-level in Experiment 3. Lastly, we discuss potential explanations and risks of our findings, limitations and future work, and the importance of language complexity and real-world comparability.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Despite the growing popularity of machine learning techniques to generate these tests, they still face several challenges, such as the mismatch of UI elements. The recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have addressed these issues by leveraging their semantic understanding capabilities. However, a significant gap remains in applying these models to industrial-level app testing, particularly in terms of cost optimization and knowledge limitation. To address this, we introduce CAT to create cost-effective UI automation tests for industry apps by combining machine learning and LLMs with best practices. Given the task description, CAT employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to source examples of industrial app usage as the few-shot learning context, assisting LLMs in generating the specific sequence of actions. CAT then employs machine learning techniques, with LLMs serving as a complementary optimizer, to map the target element on the UI screen. Our evaluations on the WeChat testing dataset demonstrate the CAT's performance and cost-effectiveness, achieving 90% UI automation with $0.34 cost, outperforming the state-of-the-art. We have also integrated our approach into the real-world WeChat testing platform, demonstrating its usefulness in detecting 141 bugs and enhancing the developers' testing process.</p></details> |  |

It depends both on common-sense knowledge on the objective side and human user preference on the subjective side. In achieving such task, we propose to mine object functionality with user preference alignment directly from the scene itself, without relying on human intervention. To do so, we work with scene graph representation and propose LLM-enhanced scene graph learning which transforms the input scene graph into an affordance-enhanced graph (AEG) with information-enhanced nodes and newly discovered edges (relations). In AEG, the nodes corresponding to the receptacle objects are augmented with context-induced affordance which encodes what kind of carriable objects can be placed on it. New edges are discovered with newly discovered non-local relations. With AEG, we perform task planning for scene rearrangement by detecting misplaced carriables and determining a proper placement for each of them. We test our method by implementing a tiding robot in simulator and perform evaluation on a new benchmark we build. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on misplacement detection and the following rearrangement planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH ASIA 2024 conference accepted</p></details> |

Applying various alignment techniques to the Falcon 11B model using safety datasets, we achieve a significant boost in global safety score (from $57.64\%$ to $99.90\%$) as measured by LlamaGuard 3 8B, competing with state-of-the-art models. On toxicity benchmarks, average scores in adversarial settings dropped from over $0.6$ to less than $0.07$. However, this safety improvement comes at the cost of reduced general capabilities, particularly in math, suggesting a trade-off. We identify noise contrastive alignment (Safe-NCA) as an optimal method for balancing safety and performance. Our study ultimately shows that alignment techniques can be sufficient for building safe and robust models.</p></details> |  |

The Fixed-Effect Fallacy and Claims of GPT-4 Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07638v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we explore evaluation of LLM capabilities. We present measurements of GPT-4 performance on several deterministic tasks; each task involves a basic calculation and takes as input parameter some element drawn from a large well-defined population (e.g., count elements in a list, multiply two k-digit numbers, etc). We examine several conditions per-task and perform enough trials so that statistically significant differences can be detected. This allows us to investigate the sensitivity of task-accuracy both to query phrasing and input parameter population. We find that seemingly trivial modifications in the task-prompt or input population can yield differences far larger than can be explained by sampling effects. For example, performance on a simple list-counting task varies with query-phrasing and list-length, but also with list composition (i.e., the thing-to-be-counted) and object frequency (e.g., success when an element accounts for $\approx$ 50\% of a list is different from when it accounts for $\approx$ 70\% etc). We conclude that efforts to quantify LLM capabilities easily succumb to the language-as-fixed-effect fallacy, where experimental observations are improperly generalized beyond what the data supports. A consequence appears to be that intuitions that have been formed based on interactions with humans form a very unreliable guide as to which input modifications should ``make no difference'' to LLM performance.</p></details> |  |

Recommender systems traditionally use methods such as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, as well as advanced techniques like deep learning and reinforcement learning. Although language models have been applied in recommendation, the recent trend have focused on leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs for more personalized suggestions. While current research focuses on English due to its resource richness, this work explores the impact of non-English prompts on recommendation performance. Using OpenP5, a platform for developing and evaluating LLM-based recommendations, we expanded its English prompt templates to include Spanish and Turkish. Evaluation on three real-world datasets, namely ML1M, LastFM, and Amazon-Beauty, showed that usage of non-English prompts generally reduce performance, especially in less-resourced languages like Turkish. We also retrained an LLM-based recommender model with multilingual prompts to analyze performance variations. Retraining with multilingual prompts resulted in more balanced performance across languages, but slightly reduced English performance. This work highlights the need for diverse language support in LLM-based recommenders and suggests future research on creating evaluation datasets, using newer models and additional languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring LLMs for Malware Detection: Review, Framework Design, and Countermeasure Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07587v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create and disseminate malware poses a significant cybersecurity challenge due to their ability to generate and distribute attacks with ease. A single prompt can initiate a wide array of malicious activities. This paper addresses this critical issue through a multifaceted approach. First, we provide a comprehensive overview of LLMs and their role in malware detection from diverse sources. We examine five specific applications of LLMs: Malware honeypots, identification of text-based threats, code analysis for detecting malicious intent, trend analysis of malware, and detection of non-standard disguised malware. Our review includes a detailed analysis of the existing literature and establishes guiding principles for the secure use of LLMs. We also introduce a classification scheme to categorize the relevant literature. Second, we propose performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in these contexts. Third, we present a risk mitigation framework designed to prevent malware by leveraging LLMs. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed risk mitigation strategies against various factors and demonstrate their effectiveness in countering LLM-enabled malware. The paper concludes by suggesting future advancements and areas requiring deeper exploration in this fascinating field of artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

By combining human flexibility and reasoning with LLM consistency, InteractEval outperforms traditional non-LLM-based and LLM-based baselines across four distinct dimensions, consisting of Coherence, Fluency, Consistency, and Relevance. The experiment also investigates the effectiveness of the TA method, showing that it promotes divergent thinking in both humans and LLMs, leading to the generation of a wider range of relevant attributes and enhance text evaluation performance. Comparative analysis reveals that humans excel at identifying attributes related to internal quality (Coherence and Fluency), but LLMs perform better at those attributes related to external alignment (Consistency and Relevance). Consequently, leveraging both humans and LLMs together produces the best evaluation outcomes. In other words, this study emphasizes the necessity of effectively combining humans and LLMs in an automated checklist-based text evaluation framework.

| **[MEDIC: Towards a Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Clinical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07314v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare applications has spurred calls for holistic evaluation beyond frequently-cited benchmarks like USMLE, to better reflect real-world performance. While real-world assessments are valuable indicators of utility, they often lag behind the pace of LLM evolution, likely rendering findings obsolete upon deployment. This temporal disconnect necessitates a comprehensive upfront evaluation that can guide model selection for specific clinical applications. We introduce MEDIC, a framework assessing LLMs across five critical dimensions of clinical competence: medical reasoning, ethics and bias, data and language understanding, in-context learning, and clinical safety. MEDIC features a novel cross-examination framework quantifying LLM performance across areas like coverage and hallucination detection, without requiring reference outputs. We apply MEDIC to evaluate LLMs on medical question-answering, safety, summarization, note generation, and other tasks. Our results show performance disparities across model sizes, baseline vs medically finetuned models, and have implications on model selection for applications requiring specific model strengths, such as low hallucination or lower cost of inference. MEDIC's multifaceted evaluation reveals these performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, ensuring that the most promising models are identified and adapted for diverse healthcare applications.</p></details> | Technical report |

We find a notable deficiency in high-quality content safety datasets and benchmarks that comprehensively cover a wide range of critical safety areas. To address this, we define a broad content safety risk taxonomy, comprising 13 critical risk and 9 sparse risk categories. Additionally, we curate AEGISSAFETYDATASET, a new dataset of approximately 26, 000 human-LLM interaction instances, complete with human annotations adhering to the taxonomy. We plan to release this dataset to the community to further research and to help benchmark LLM models for safety. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we instruction-tune multiple LLM-based safety models. We show that our models (named AEGISSAFETYEXPERTS), not only surpass or perform competitively with the state-of-the-art LLM-based safety models and general purpose LLMs, but also exhibit robustness across multiple jail-break attack categories. We also show how using AEGISSAFETYDATASET during the LLM alignment phase does not negatively impact the performance of the aligned models on MT Bench scores. Furthermore, we propose AEGIS, a novel application of a no-regret online adaptation framework with strong theoretical guarantees, to perform content moderation with an ensemble of LLM content safety experts in deployment</p></details> |  |
| **[STORE: Streamlining Semantic Tokenization and Generative Recommendation with A Single LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07276v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommendation models often rely on unique item identifiers (IDs) to distinguish between items, which can hinder their ability to effectively leverage item content information and generalize to long-tail or cold-start items. Recently, semantic tokenization has been proposed as a promising solution that aims to tokenize each item's semantic representation into a sequence of discrete tokens. In this way, it preserves the item's semantics within these tokens and ensures that semantically similar items are represented by similar tokens. These semantic tokens have become fundamental in training generative recommendation models. However, existing generative recommendation methods typically involve multiple sub-models for embedding, quantization, and recommendation, leading to an overly complex system. In this paper, we propose to streamline the semantic tokenization and generative recommendation process with a unified framework, dubbed STORE, which leverages a single large language model (LLM) for both tasks. Specifically, we formulate semantic tokenization as a text-to-token task and generative recommendation as a token-to-token task, supplemented by a token-to-text reconstruction task and a text-to-token auxiliary task. All these tasks are framed in a generative manner and trained using a single LLM backbone. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our STORE framework across various recommendation tasks and datasets. We will release the source code and configurations for reproducible research.</p></details> |  |

While a major portion of the content is posted to promote citizen journalism and public awareness, some content is posted to mislead users. Among different content types such as text, images, and videos, memes (text overlaid on images) are particularly prevalent and can serve as powerful vehicles for propaganda, hate, and humor. In the current literature, there have been efforts to individually detect such content in memes. However, the study of their intersection is very limited. In this study, we explore the intersection between propaganda and hate in memes using a multi-agent LLM-based approach. We extend the propagandistic meme dataset with coarse and fine-grained hate labels. Our finding suggests that there is an association between propaganda and hate in memes. We provide detailed experimental results that can serve as a baseline for future studies. We will make the experimental resources publicly available to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>propa...</summary><p>propaganda, hate-speech, disinformation, misinformation, fake news, LLMs, GPT-4, multimodality, multimodal LLMs</p></details> |

Because the LLMs cannot currently reliably identify the origin of the information used to construct the response to the user query, our approach is to avoid using internal LLM factual knowledge altogether. Instead, verified RDF statements are compared to chunks of external documents retrieved through a web search or Wikipedia. To assess the possible application of this workflow on biosciences content, we evaluated 1,719 positive statements from the BioRED dataset and the same number of newly generated negative statements. The resulting precision is 88%, and recall is 44%. This indicates that the method requires human oversight. We demonstrate the method on Wikidata, where a SPARQL query is used to automatically retrieve statements needing verification. Overall, the results suggest that LLMs could be used for large-scale verification of statements in KGs, a task previously unfeasible due to human annotation costs.</p></details> |  |

Toward efficient wireless LLM inference in edge computing, this study comprehensively analyzes the impact of different splitting points in mainstream open-source LLMs. On this basis, this study introduces a framework taking inspiration from model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to determine the optimal splitting point across the edge and user equipment (UE). By incorporating a reward surrogate model, our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of frequent performance evaluations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this method effectively balances inference performance and computational load under varying network conditions, providing a robust solution for LLM deployment in decentralized settings.</p></details> |  |

This article explores whether large language models (LLMs) could address this by extracting a small number of interpretable features from text. We demonstrate this process on two datasets (CORD-19 and M17+) containing several thousand scientific articles from multiple disciplines and a target being a proxy for research impact. An evaluation based on testing for the statistically significant correlation with research impact has shown that LLama 2-generated features are semantically meaningful. We consequently used these generated features in text classification to predict the binary target variable representing the citation rate for the CORD-19 dataset and the ordinal 5-class target representing an expert-awarded grade in the M17+ dataset. Machine-learning models trained on the LLM-generated features provided similar predictive performance to the state-of-the-art embedding model SciBERT for scientific text. The LLM used only 62 features compared to 768 features in SciBERT embeddings, and these features were directly interpretable, corresponding to notions such as article methodological rigor, novelty, or grammatical correctness. As the final step, we extract a small number of well-interpretable action rules. Consistently competitive results obtained with the same LLM feature set across both thematically diverse datasets show that this approach generalizes across domains.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a performance gap in this area between existing open-source models and closed-source models such as GPT-4. In this paper, we introduce MathGenie, a novel method for generating diverse and reliable math problems from a small-scale problem-solution dataset (denoted as seed data). We augment the ground-truth solutions of our seed data and train a back-translation model to translate the augmented solutions back into new questions. Subsequently, we generate code-integrated solutions for the new questions. To ensure the correctness of the code-integrated solutions, we employ rationale-based strategy for solution verification. Various pretrained models, ranging from 7B to 70B, are trained on the newly curated data to test the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation technique, resulting in a family of models known as MathGenieLM. These models consistently outperform previous open-source models across five representative mathematical reasoning datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. In particular, MathGenieLM-InternLM2 achieves an accuracy of 87.7% on GSM8K and 55.7% on MATH, securing the best overall score among open-source language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024 camera ready</p></details> |

However, their reliability becomes critical, especially when these models are exposed to misinformation. We primarily analyze the susceptibility of state-of-the-art LLMs to factual inaccuracies when they encounter false information in a QnA scenario, an issue that can lead to a phenomenon we refer to as *knowledge drift*, which significantly undermines the trustworthiness of these models. We evaluate the factuality and the uncertainty of the models' responses relying on Entropy, Perplexity, and Token Probability metrics. Our experiments reveal that an LLM's uncertainty can increase up to 56.6% when the question is answered incorrectly due to the exposure to false information. At the same time, repeated exposure to the same false information can decrease the models uncertainty again (-52.8% w.r.t. the answers on the untainted prompts), potentially manipulating the underlying model's beliefs and introducing a drift from its original knowledge. These findings provide insights into LLMs' robustness and vulnerability to adversarial inputs, paving the way for developing more reliable LLM applications across various domains.

Once considered unattainable, AI's role in literary creation is increasingly becoming a reality. In genres such as poetry, jokes, and short stories, numerous AI tools have emerged, offering refreshing new perspectives. However, it's difficult to further improve the quality of these works. This is primarily because understanding and appreciating a good literary work involves a considerable threshold, such as knowledge of literary theory, aesthetic sensibility, interdisciplinary knowledge. Therefore, authoritative data in this area is quite lacking. Additionally, evaluating literary works is often complex and hard to fully quantify, which directly hinders the further development of AI creation. To address this issue, this paper attempts to explore the mysteries of literary texts from the perspective of LLMs, using ancient Chinese poetry as an example for experimentation. First, we collected a variety of ancient poems from different sources and had experts annotate a small portion of them. Then, we designed a range of comprehension metrics based on LLMs to evaluate all these poems. Finally, we analyzed the correlations and differences between various poem collections to identify literary patterns. Through our experiments, we observed a series of enlightening phenomena that provide technical support for the future development of high-level literary creation based on LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Filtration in RLHF to Fine-Tune LLM for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06957v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is one of the key techniques that helps large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and provide helpful and harmless responses. While direct policy optimization methods exist, state-of-the-art LLMs adopt RL-based methods (usually PPO) in RLHF to train the policy to generate good responses guided by a reward model learned from preference data. The main challenge of these methods is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in code generation tasks that require long and complex reasoning to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtration strategy for a given reward model, the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) between rewards and actual scores on filtered samples serves as a good metrics and helps us find several promising strategies. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation tasks, and find that some variants of PF-PPO are highly effective and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval, MBPP, and a new and more challenging LeetCode Contest benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaPPA: Adaptive Position Pre-Fill Jailbreak Attack Approach Targeting LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07503v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) refer to methods that extract malicious content from the model by carefully crafting prompts or suffixes, which has garnered significant attention from the research community. However, traditional attack methods, which primarily focus on the semantic level, are easily detected by the model. These methods overlook the difference in the model's alignment protection capabilities at different output stages. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive position pre-fill jailbreak attack approach for executing jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Our method leverages the model's instruction-following capabilities to first output pre-filled safe content, then exploits its narrative-shifting abilities to generate harmful content. Extensive black-box experiments demonstrate our method can improve the attack success rate by 47% on the widely recognized secure model (Llama2) compared to existing approaches.

Most current research focuses on optimizing individual sub-procedures, e.g. local inference and communication, however, there is no comprehensive framework that provides a holistic system view for optimizing LLM serving in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis to identify major bottlenecks that impact end-to-end latency in LLM serving systems. Our analysis reveals that a comprehensive LLM serving endpoint must address a series of efficiency bottlenecks that extend beyond LLM inference. We then propose ScaleLLM, an optimized system for resource-efficient LLM serving. Our extensive experiments reveal that with 64 concurrent requests, ScaleLLM achieves a 4.3x speed up over vLLM and outperforms state-of-the-arts with 1.5x higher throughput.</p></details> |  |

However the task of accurately extracting and summarizing necessary information from highly specialized documents such as research papers has not been sufficiently investigated. We are focusing on the task of extracting research questions (RQ) from research papers and construct a new dataset consisting of machine learning papers, RQ extracted from these papers by GPT-4, and human evaluations of the extracted RQ from multiple perspectives. Using this dataset, we systematically compared recently proposed LLM-based evaluation functions for summarizations, and found that none of the functions showed sufficiently high correlations with human evaluations. We expect our dataset provides a foundation for further research on developing better evaluation functions tailored to the RQ extraction task, and contribute to enhance the performance of the task.

| **[A System and Benchmark for LLM-based Q&A on Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05735v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many industrial settings, users wish to ask questions whose answers may be found in structured data sources such as a spreadsheets, databases, APIs, or combinations thereof. Often, the user doesn't know how to identify or access the right data source. This problem is compounded even further if multiple (and potentially siloed) data sources must be assembled to derive the answer. Recently, various Text-to-SQL applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) have addressed some of these problems by enabling users to ask questions in natural language. However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they fail to cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this paper, we address heterogeneity by introducing the siwarex platform, which enables seamless natural language access to both databases and APIs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of siwarex, we extend the popular Spider dataset and benchmark by replacing some of its tables by data retrieval APIs. We find that siwarex does a good job of coping with data source heterogeneity. Our modified Spider benchmark will soon be available to the research community</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Enhanced Software Patch Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06816v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open source software (OSS) is integral to modern product development, and any vulnerability within it potentially compromises numerous products. While developers strive to apply security patches, pinpointing these patches among extensive OSS updates remains a challenge. Security patch localization (SPL) recommendation methods are leading approaches to address this. However, existing SPL models often falter when a commit lacks a clear association with its corresponding CVE, and do not consider a scenario that a vulnerability has multiple patches proposed over time before it has been fully resolved. To address these challenges, we introduce LLM-SPL, a recommendation-based SPL approach that leverages the capabilities of the Large Language Model (LLM) to locate the security patch commit for a given CVE. More specifically, we propose a joint learning framework, in which the outputs of LLM serves as additional features to aid our recommendation model in prioritizing security patches. Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,915 CVEs associated with 2,461 patches demonstrates that LLM-SPL excels in ranking patch commits, surpassing the state-of-the-art method in terms of Recall, while significantly reducing manual effort. Notably, for vulnerabilities requiring multiple patches, LLM-SPL significantly improves Recall by 22.83\%, NDCG by 19.41\%, and reduces manual effort by over 25\% when checking up to the top 10 rankings. The dataset and source code are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-SPL-91F8}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geo-Llama: Leveraging LLMs for Human Mobility Trajectory Generation with Spatiotemporal Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13918v3)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating human mobility data is essential for various application domains, including transportation, urban planning, and epidemic control, since real data are often inaccessible to researchers due to expensive costs and privacy issues. Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

LLMs have the potential to affect traditional forms of democratic engagements, such as voter choice, government surveys, or even online communication with regulators; since bots are capable of producing large quantities of credible text. To investigate the human perception of LLM-generated content, we recruited over 1,000 participants who then tried to differentiate bot from human posts in social media discussion threads. We found that humans perform poorly at identifying the true nature of user posts on social media. We also found patterns in how humans identify LLM-generated text content in social media discourse. Finally, we observed the Uncanny Valley effect in text dialogue in both user perception and identification. This indicates that despite humans being poor at the identification process, they can still sense discomfort when reading LLM-generated content.</p></details> |  |

Efficient management of energy-reliability tradeoffs in these systems demands the ability to predict various conditions during vehicle operations. With the promising improvement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the emergence of well-known models like ChatGPT, unique opportunities for autonomous vehicle-related predictions have been provided in recent years. This paper proposed MAPS using LLMs as map reader co-drivers to predict the vital parameters to set during the autonomous vehicle operation to balance the energy-reliability tradeoff. The MAPS method demonstrates a 20% improvement in navigation accuracy compared to the best baseline method. MAPS also shows 11% energy savings in computational units and up to 54% in both mechanical and computational units.</p></details> |  |

This is particularly important in online spaces. On the Web, narratives can spread rapidly and intensify societal divides and conflicts. While many qualitative approaches exist, quantifying narratives remains a significant challenge. Computational narrative analysis lacks frameworks that are both comprehensive and generalizable. To address this gap, we introduce a numerical narrative representation grounded in structuralist linguistic theory. Chiefly, Greimas' Actantial Model represents a narrative through a constellation of six functional character roles. These so-called actants are genre-agnostic, making the model highly generalizable. We extract the actants using an open-source LLM and integrate them into a Narrative-Structured Text Embedding that captures both the semantics and narrative structure of a text. We demonstrate the analytical insights of the method on the example of 5000 full-text news articles from Al Jazeera and The Washington Post on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Our method successfully distinguishes articles that cover the same topics but differ in narrative structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Uncovering LLM's Capabilities in Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09654v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are markedly proficient in deriving visual representations guided by natural language. Recent explorations have utilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by pairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal conditions, referred to as anomaly prompts. However, existing approaches depend on static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and prioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level image-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization. In this paper, we present ALFA, a training-free approach designed to address these challenges via a unified model. We propose a run-time prompt adaptation strategy, which first generates informative anomaly prompts to leverage the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). This strategy is enhanced by a contextual scoring mechanism for per-image anomaly prompt adaptation and cross-semantic ambiguity mitigation. We further introduce a novel fine-grained aligner to fuse local pixel-level semantics for precise anomaly localization, by projecting the image-text alignment from global to local semantic spaces. Extensive evaluations on MVTec and VisA datasets confirm ALFA's effectiveness in harnessing the language potential for zero-shot VAD, achieving significant PRO improvements of 12.1% on MVTec and 8.9% on VisA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MM'24 (Oral)</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to enable long-context LLMs to generate responses with fine-grained sentence-level citations, improving their faithfulness and verifiability. We first introduce LongBench-Cite, an automated benchmark for assessing current LLMs' performance in Long-Context Question Answering with Citations (LQAC), revealing considerable room for improvement. To this end, we propose CoF (Coarse to Fine), a novel pipeline that utilizes off-the-shelf LLMs to automatically generate long-context QA instances with precise sentence-level citations, and leverage this pipeline to construct LongCite-45k, a large-scale SFT dataset for LQAC. Finally, we train LongCite-8B and LongCite-9B using the LongCite-45k dataset, successfully enabling their generation of accurate responses and fine-grained sentence-level citations in a single output. The evaluation results on LongBench-Cite show that our trained models achieve state-of-the-art citation quality, surpassing advanced proprietary models including GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automate Strategy Finding with LLM in Quant investment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06289v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress in deep learning for financial trading, existing models often face instability and high uncertainty, hindering their practical application. Leveraging advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent architectures, we propose a novel framework for quantitative stock investment in portfolio management and alpha mining. Our framework addresses these issues by integrating LLMs to generate diversified alphas and employing a multi-agent approach to dynamically evaluate market conditions. This paper proposes a framework where large language models (LLMs) mine alpha factors from multimodal financial data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. The first module extracts predictive signals by integrating numerical data, research papers, and visual charts. The second module uses ensemble learning to construct a diverse pool of trading agents with varying risk preferences, enhancing strategy performance through a broader market analysis. In the third module, a dynamic weight-gating mechanism selects and assigns weights to the most relevant agents based on real-time market conditions, enabling the creation of an adaptive and context-aware composite alpha formula. Extensive experiments on the Chinese stock markets demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple financial metrics. The results underscore the efficacy of combining LLM-generated alphas with a multi-agent architecture to achieve superior trading performance and stability. This work highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches in enhancing quantitative investment strategies and sets a new benchmark for integrating advanced machine learning techniques in financial trading can also be applied on diverse markets.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and AI-chaining, our approach allows users to author shape-changing behaviors on demand through text prompts without programming. We describe the foundational aspects necessary for such a system, including the identification of key generative elements (primitive, animation, and interaction) and design requirements to enhance user interaction, based on formative exploration and iterative design processes. Based on these insights, we develop SHAPE-IT, an LLM-based authoring tool for a 24 x 24 shape display, which translates the user's textual command into executable code and allows for quick exploration through a web-based control interface. We evaluate the effectiveness of SHAPE-IT in two ways: 1) performance evaluation and 2) user evaluation (N= 10). The study conclusions highlight the ability to facilitate rapid ideation of a wide range of shape-changing behaviors with AI. However, the findings also expose accuracy-related challenges and limitations, prompting further exploration into refining the framework for leveraging AI to better suit the unique requirements of shape-changing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ACM UIST 2024</p></details> |

However, LLM-assisted approaches for HDL generation struggle when handling complex tasks. We introduce a suite of hierarchical prompting techniques which facilitate efficient stepwise design methods, and develop a generalizable automation pipeline for the process. To evaluate these techniques, we present a benchmark set of hardware designs which have solutions with or without architectural hierarchy. Using these benchmarks, we compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs, including our own fine-tuned Code Llama-Verilog model. Our hierarchical methods automatically produce successful designs for complex hardware modules that standard flat prompting methods cannot achieve, allowing smaller open-source LLMs to compete with large proprietary models. Hierarchical prompting reduces HDL generation time and yields savings on LLM costs. Our experiments detail which LLMs are capable of which applications, and how to apply hierarchical methods in various modes. We explore case studies of generating complex cores using automatic scripted hierarchical prompts, including the first-ever LLM-designed processor with no human feedback. Tools for the Recurrent Optimization via Machine Editing (ROME) method can be found at https://github.com/ajn313/ROME-LLM</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MLCAD '24. 10 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[User-LLM: Efficient LLM Contextualization with User Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13598v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, but effectively incorporating complex and potentially noisy user timeline data into LLMs remains a challenge. Current approaches often involve translating user timelines into text descriptions before feeding them to LLMs, which can be inefficient and may not fully capture the nuances of user behavior. Inspired by how LLMs are effectively integrated with images through direct embeddings, we propose User-LLM, a novel framework that leverages user embeddings to directly contextualize LLMs with user history interactions. These embeddings, generated by a user encoder pretrained using self-supervised learning on diverse user interactions, capture latent user behaviors and interests as well as their evolution over time. We integrate these user embeddings with LLMs through cross-attention, enabling LLMs to dynamically adapt their responses based on the context of a user's past actions and preferences. Our approach achieves significant efficiency gains by representing user timelines directly as embeddings, leading to substantial inference speedups of up to 78.1X. Comprehensive experiments on MovieLens, Amazon Review, and Google Local Review datasets demonstrate that User-LLM outperforms text-prompt-based contextualization on tasks requiring deep user understanding, with improvements of up to 16.33%, particularly excelling on long sequences that capture subtle shifts in user behavior. Furthermore, the incorporation of Perceiver layers streamlines the integration between user encoders and LLMs, yielding additional computational savings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruct-SkillMix: A Powerful Pipeline for LLM Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14774v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Instruct-SkillMix, an automated approach for creating diverse, high quality SFT data. The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline involves two stages, each leveraging an existing powerful LLM: (1) Skill extraction: uses the LLM to extract core "skills" for instruction-following, either from existing datasets, or by directly prompting the model; (2) Data generation: uses the powerful LLM to generate (instruction, response) data that exhibit a randomly chosen pair of these skills. Here, the use of random skill combinations promotes diversity and difficulty. Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from Instruct-SkillMix leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench. With just $4$K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. To our knowledge, this achieves state-of-the-art performance among all models that have only undergone SFT (no RL methods) and competes with proprietary models such as Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct. Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult. Introducing low quality answers ("shirkers") in $20\%$ of Instruct-SkillMix examples causes performance to plummet, sometimes catastrophically. The Instruct-SkillMix pipeline is flexible and is adaptable to other settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Will Always Hallucinate, and We Need to Live With This](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05746v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models become more ubiquitous across domains, it becomes important to examine their inherent limitations critically. This work argues that hallucinations in language models are not just occasional errors but an inevitable feature of these systems. We demonstrate that hallucinations stem from the fundamental mathematical and logical structure of LLMs. It is, therefore, impossible to eliminate them through architectural improvements, dataset enhancements, or fact-checking mechanisms. Our analysis draws on computational theory and Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, which references the undecidability of problems like the Halting, Emptiness, and Acceptance Problems. We demonstrate that every stage of the LLM process-from training data compilation to fact retrieval, intent classification, and text generation-will have a non-zero probability of producing hallucinations. This work introduces the concept of Structural Hallucination as an intrinsic nature of these systems. By establishing the mathematical certainty of hallucinations, we challenge the prevailing notion that they can be fully mitigated.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an efficient and effective framework that integrates multiple modalities (images, 3D, audio and video) to a frozen LLM and demonstrates an emergent ability for cross-modal reasoning (2+ modality inputs). Our approach explores two distinct projection mechanisms: Q-Formers and Linear Projections (LPs). Through extensive experimentation across all four modalities on 16 benchmarks, we explore both methods and assess their adaptability in integrated and separate cross-modal reasoning. The Q-Former projection demonstrates superior performance in single modality scenarios and adaptability in joint versus discriminative reasoning involving two or more modalities. However, it exhibits lower generalization capabilities than linear projection in contexts where task-modality data are limited. To enable this framework, we devise a scalable pipeline that automatically generates high-quality, instruction-tuning datasets from readily available captioning data across different modalities, and contribute 24K QA data for audio and 250K QA data for 3D. To facilitate further research in cross-modal reasoning, we introduce the DisCRn (Discriminative Cross-modal Reasoning) benchmark comprising 9K audio-video QA samples and 28K image-3D QA samples that require the model to reason discriminatively across disparate input modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, with difficulties of reversing thinking patterns and irrelevant premises, how to determine the authenticity of the cause in abductive logical reasoning remains underexplored. Inspired by hypothesis and verification method and identification of irrelevant information in human thinking process, we propose a new framework for LLMs abductive logical reasoning called CauseJudger (CJ), which identifies the authenticity of possible cause by transforming thinking from reverse to forward and removing irrelevant information. In addition, we construct an abductive logical reasoning dataset for decision task called CauseLogics, which contains 200,000 tasks of varying reasoning lengths. Our experiments show the efficiency of CJ with overall experiments and ablation experiments as well as case studies on our dataset and reconstructed public dataset. Notably, CJ's implementation is efficient, requiring only two calls to LLM. Its impact is profound: when using gpt-3.5, CJ achieves a maximum correctness improvement of 41% compared to Zero-Shot-CoT. Moreover, with gpt-4, CJ attains an accuracy exceeding 90% across all datasets.</p></details> |  |

| **[Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00523v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have significantly improved automated task-solving capabilities using autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). However, most LLM-based agents focus on dialogue, programming, or specialized domains, leaving their potential for addressing generative AI safety tasks largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Atlas, an advanced LLM-based multi-agent framework targeting generative AI models, specifically focusing on jailbreak attacks against text-to-image (T2I) models with built-in safety filters. Atlas consists of two agents, namely the mutation agent and the selection agent, each comprising four key modules: a vision-language model (VLM) or LLM brain, planning, memory, and tool usage. The mutation agent uses its VLM brain to determine whether a prompt triggers the T2I model's safety filter. It then collaborates iteratively with the LLM brain of the selection agent to generate new candidate jailbreak prompts with the highest potential to bypass the filter. In addition to multi-agent communication, we leverage in-context learning (ICL) memory mechanisms and the chain-of-thought (COT) approach to learn from past successes and failures, thereby enhancing Atlas's performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that Atlas successfully jailbreaks several state-of-the-art T2I models equipped with multi-modal safety filters in a black-box setting. Additionally, Atlas outperforms existing methods in both query efficiency and the quality of generated images. This work convincingly demonstrates the successful application of LLM-based agents in studying the safety vulnerabilities of popular text-to-image generation models. We urge the community to consider advanced techniques like ours in response to the rapidly evolving text-to-image generation field.</p></details> |  |

With the right tools, these agents could learn to solve tasks in new environments by accumulating and updating their knowledge. Current LLM-based agents process past experiences using a full history of observations, summarization, retrieval augmentation. However, these unstructured memory representations do not facilitate the reasoning and planning essential for complex decision-making. In our study, we introduce AriGraph, a novel method wherein the agent constructs and updates a memory graph that integrates semantic and episodic memories while exploring the environment. We demonstrate that our Ariadne LLM agent, consisting of the proposed memory architecture augmented with planning and decision-making, effectively handles complex tasks within interactive text game environments difficult even for human players. Results show that our approach markedly outperforms other established memory methods and strong RL baselines in a range of problems of varying complexity. Additionally, AriGraph demonstrates competitive performance compared to dedicated knowledge graph-based methods in static multi-hop question-answering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code for this work is avaliable at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/AriGraph</p></details> |

However, these models are susceptible to safety vulnerabilities such as jailbreaking, prompt injection, and privacy leakage attacks. These vulnerabilities can lead to the generation of malicious content, unauthorized actions, or the disclosure of confidential information. While foundational LLMs undergo alignment training and incorporate safety measures, they are often subject to fine-tuning, or doing quantization resource-constrained environments. This study investigates the impact of these modifications on LLM safety, a critical consideration for building reliable and secure AI systems. We evaluate foundational models including Mistral, Llama series, Qwen, and MosaicML, along with their fine-tuned variants. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that fine-tuning generally increases the success rates of jailbreak attacks, while quantization has variable effects on attack success rates. Importantly, we find that properly implemented guardrails significantly enhance resistance to jailbreak attempts. These findings contribute to our understanding of LLM vulnerabilities and provide insights for developing more robust safety strategies in the deployment of language models.</p></details> |  |

These two capabilities are essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt and are complementary to each other, depending on the downstream tasks and computational budgets. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K benchmarks and real-world 128K tasks.

However, the effects of hallucinations (e.g., output noise) make it particularly challenging for LLMs to generate high-quality code in one pass. In this work, we propose a simple and effective \textbf{u}ncertainty-aware \textbf{s}elective \textbf{c}ontrastive \textbf{d}ecoding ($\mathbb{USCD}$) mechanism to improve the quality of one-pass code generation in LLMs and reduce the impact of output noise. To be specific, we first elaborately designed a negative prompt (namely lame prompt) to output noise by removing input-output examples from the standard few-shot prompt. Our preliminary study shows that the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JS divergence) between token distribution uncertainty and the output noise is relatively low (approximately $0.25$), indicating their high relevance. Then, we selectively eliminate output noise induced by lame prompts based on the uncertainty of the prediction distribution from the standard prompt. Notably, our proposed plug-and-play mechanism is an inference-only method, enjoying appealing flexibility. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, e.g., HumanEval, MBPP, and MultiPL-E, upon several LLMs (i.e., Inocder-6b, CodeLlama-7b, WizardCoder-15b, StarCoder, and Llama2-7b), demonstrate that our proposed USCD significantly improves one-pass code generation, with an average \textit{pass@$1$} scores increase of 16.59\%. We will release code and data on GitHub.</p></details> | 13pages,8 figures |

These models can process multi-modal prompts, enabling them to generate more context-aware responses. However, this integration is not without challenges. One of the primary concerns is the potential security risks associated with using LLMs in robotic navigation tasks. These tasks require precise and reliable responses to ensure safe and effective operation. Multi-modal prompts, while enhancing the robot's understanding, also introduce complexities that can be exploited maliciously. For instance, adversarial inputs designed to mislead the model can lead to incorrect or dangerous navigational decisions. This study investigates the impact of prompt injections on mobile robot performance in LLM-integrated systems and explores secure prompt strategies to mitigate these risks. Our findings demonstrate a substantial overall improvement of approximately 30.8% in both attack detection and system performance with the implementation of robust defence mechanisms, highlighting their critical role in enhancing security and reliability in mission-oriented tasks.</p></details> |  |

We instructed nine popular LLMs to answer a series of multiple-choice questions to provide a performance baseline. For each incorrectly answered question, we instructed eight types of self-reflecting LLM agents to reflect on their mistakes and provide themselves with guidance to improve problem-solving. Then, using this guidance, each self-reflecting agent attempted to re-answer the same questions. Our results indicate that LLM agents are able to significantly improve their problem-solving performance through self-reflection ($p < 0.001$). In addition, we compared the various types of self-reflection to determine their individual contribution to performance.

Innovations include establishing a method that 1) works with qualitative user experience data without the need for explicit review scores, 2) focuses on implicit user satisfaction, and 3) provides scaled numerical sentiment analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of user sentiment, instead of simply classifying sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative. Data is collected using the Microsoft Product Desirability Toolkit (PDT), a well-known qualitative user experience analysis tool. For initial exploration, the PDT metric was given to users of two software systems. PDT data was fed through several LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3 and 3.5, GPT4, and GPT4o) and through a leading transfer learning technique, Twitter-Roberta-Base-Sentiment, and Vader, a leading sentiment analysis tool. Each system was asked to evaluate the data in two ways, by looking at the sentiment expressed in the PDT word/explanation pairs; and by looking at the sentiment expressed by the users in their grouped selection of five words and explanations, as a whole. Each LLM provided a sentiment score, its confidence (low, medium, high) in the score, and an explanation of the score. All LLMs tested were able to statistically detect user sentiment from the users' grouped data, whereas TRBS and Vader were not. The confidence and explanation of confidence provided by the LLMs assisted in understanding user sentiment. This study adds deeper understanding of evaluating user experiences, toward the goal of creating a universal tool that quantifies implicit sentiment.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, updated to incorporate feedback</p></details> |

However, many practical applications demand the seamless integration of both retrieval and generation. This paper introduces a novel and efficient One-pass Generation and retrieval framework (OneGen), designed to improve LLMs' performance on tasks that require both generation and retrieval. The proposed framework bridges the traditionally separate training approaches for generation and retrieval by incorporating retrieval tokens generated autoregressively. This enables a single LLM to handle both tasks simultaneously in a unified forward pass. We conduct experiments on two distinct types of composite tasks, RAG and Entity Linking, to validate the pluggability, effectiveness, and efficiency of OneGen in training and inference. Furthermore, our results show that integrating generation and retrieval within the same context preserves the generative capabilities of LLMs while improving retrieval performance. To the best of our knowledge, OneGen is the first to enable LLMs to conduct vector retrieval during the generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress; code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/OneGen</p></details> |

NeurIPS 2020, Wei et al. TMLR 2022, Wei et al. NeurIPS 2022]. Recently, researchers and practitioners have been "playing" with prompts (e.g., In-Context Learning) to see how to make the most of pre-trained Language Models. By homogeneously dissecting more than a hundred articles, we investigate how software testing and verification research communities have leveraged LLMs capabilities. First, we validate that downstream tasks are adequate to convey a nontrivial modular blueprint of prompt-based proposals in scope. Moreover, we name and classify the concrete downstream tasks we recover in both validation research papers and solution proposals. In order to perform classification, mapping, and analysis, we also develop a novel downstream-task taxonomy. The main taxonomy requirement is to highlight commonalities while exhibiting variation points of task types that enable pinpointing emerging patterns in a varied spectrum of Software Engineering problems that encompasses testing, fuzzing, fault localization, vulnerability detection, static analysis, and program verification approaches. Avenues for future research are also discussed based on conceptual clusters induced by the taxonomy.</p></details> |  |

However, since different apps may implement the same functionality in different ways, direct mapping may result in incomplete or buggy test cases, thus significantly impacting the effectiveness of testing target functionality and the practical applicability. In this paper, we propose a new migration paradigm (i.e., abstraction-concretization paradigm) that first abstracts the test logic for the target functionality and then utilizes this logic to generate the concrete GUI test case. Furthermore, we introduce MACdroid, the first approach that migrates GUI test cases based on this paradigm. Specifically, we propose an abstraction technique that utilizes source test cases from source apps targeting the same functionality to extract a general test logic for that functionality. Then, we propose a concretization technique that utilizes the general test logic to guide an LLM in generating the corresponding GUI test case (including events and assertions) for the target app. We evaluate MACdroid on two widely-used datasets (including 31 apps, 34 functionalities, and 123 test cases). On the FrUITeR dataset, the test cases generated by MACdroid successfully test 64% of the target functionalities, improving the baselines by 191%. On the Lin dataset, MACdroid successfully tests 75% of the target functionalities, outperforming the baselines by 42%. These results underscore the effectiveness of MACdroid in GUI test migration.</p></details> |  |

The chain of thought (CoT), which often contains zero-shot CoT and few-shot CoT, is a recently developed prompting method that can explain the reasoning process to the LLM and outperforms simple prompting in three challenging reasoning tasks, including arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning. Inspired by zero-shot CoT, and further extending the zero-shot ability, this paper proposes a novel hint of thought (HoT) prompting with explain-ability and zero-shot generalization. It is decomposed into three steps: explainable sub-questions, logical reasoning, and answering. Such three steps are sequentially ordered in step-by-step hints, which can be easily adjusted and explained to different tasks. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our HoT prompting has a significant advantage on the zero-shot reasoning task compared to existing zero-shot CoT. We did zero-shot experiments on math tasks like GSM8K, ADDSUB, AQUA, SVAMP, and commonsense tasks such as StrategyQA. In particular, the accuracy of the proposed HoT prompting is improved with GSM8K from 40.50% to 70.65%, with AQUA from 31.9% to 46.4%, with SVAMP from 63.7% to 76.9%, and with ADDSUB from 74.7% to 87.34%, respectively, which even defeats the competitive PoT approach on GSM8k, AQUA, and SVAMP.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstInfer: In-Storage Attention Offloading for Cost-Effective Long-Context LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04992v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread of Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a significant milestone in generative AI. Nevertheless, the increasing context length and batch size in offline LLM inference escalate the memory requirement of the key-value (KV) cache, which imposes a huge burden on the GPU VRAM, especially for resource-constraint scenarios (e.g., edge computing and personal devices). Several cost-effective solutions leverage host memory or SSDs to reduce storage costs for offline inference scenarios and improve the throughput. Nevertheless, they suffer from significant performance penalties imposed by intensive KV cache accesses due to limited PCIe bandwidth. To address these issues, we propose InstInfer, a novel LLM inference system that offloads the most performance-critical computation (i.e., attention in decoding phase) and data (i.e., KV cache) parts to Computational Storage Drives (CSDs), which minimize the enormous KV transfer overheads. InstInfer designs a dedicated flash-aware in-storage attention engine with KV cache management mechanisms to exploit the high internal bandwidths of CSDs instead of being limited by the PCIe bandwidth. The optimized P2P transmission between GPU and CSDs further reduces data migration overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that for a 13B model using an NVIDIA A6000 GPU, InstInfer improves throughput for long-sequence inference by up to 11.1$\times$, compared to existing SSD-based solutions such as FlexGen.</p></details> |  |

Designing and Developing LLM based-Chatbot for Teaching English Conversation in EFL, Findings and Limitations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04987v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the design, development, and evaluation of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot for teaching English conversations in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context. Employing the Design and Development Research (DDR), we analyzed needs, established design principles, and iteratively refined a chatbot through experimenting various LLMs and alignment methods. Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we identified the most effective LLM and its prompt combination to generate high-quality, contextually appropriate responses. Interviews with teachers provided insights into desirable system features, potential educational applications, and ethical considerations in the development and deployment of the chatbots. The design iterations yielded the importance of feedback mechanisms and customizable AI personas. Future research should explore adaptive feedback strategies, collaborative approaches with various stakeholders, and the integration of insights from human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX) design. This study contributes to the growing body of research on applying LLMs in language education, providing insights and recommendations for the design, development, and evaluation of LLM-based chatbots for EFL conversation practice. As the field evolves, ongoing research and collaboration among educators, AI engineers, and other stakeholders will be essential to harness the potential of these technologies to enhance language learning experiences.</p></details> | 56 pages |

A Study on Speech Large Language Models' Ability to Identify and Understand Speaker in Spoken Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04927v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, we have observed a rapid advancement in speech language models (SpeechLLMs), catching up with humans' listening and reasoning abilities. Remarkably, SpeechLLMs have demonstrated impressive spoken dialogue question-answering (SQA) performance in benchmarks like Gaokao, the English listening test of the college entrance exam in China, which seemingly requires understanding both the spoken content and voice characteristics of speakers in a conversation. However, after carefully examining Gaokao's questions, we find the correct answers to many questions can be inferred from the conversation context alone without identifying the speaker asked in the question. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models Qwen-Audio and WavLLM in both Gaokao and our proposed "What Do You Like?" dataset shows a significantly higher accuracy in these context-based questions than in identity-critical questions, which can only be answered correctly with correct speaker identification. Our results and analysis suggest that when solving SQA, the current SpeechLLMs exhibit limited speaker awareness from the audio and behave similarly to an LLM reasoning from the conversation transcription without sound. We propose that our definitions and automated classification of context-based and identity-critical questions could offer a more accurate evaluation framework of SpeechLLMs in SQA tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE SLT 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Fellowship of the LLMs: Multi-Agent Workflows for Synthetic Preference Optimization Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08688v3)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets generated using multi-agent workflows and evaluates the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) response evaluation, and (2) response generation. In the response evaluation module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. In each step, we use inter-rater agreement using Cohen's Kappa between human annotators and LLMs. For the response generation module, we compare different configurations for the LLM Feedback Loop using the identified LLM evaluator configuration. We use the win rate (the fraction of times a generation framework is selected as the best by an LLM evaluator) to determine the best multi-agent configuration for generation. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we use models from the GPT, Gemma, and Llama families to generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline. We generate two types of PO datasets, one to improve the generation capabilities of individual LLM and the other to improve the multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across datasets when the candidate responses do not include responses from the GPT family. Additionally, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-agent Llama and Gemma, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporate LLMs with Influential Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04827v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have achieved increasing accuracy over the years. However, this precision often leads users to narrow their interests, resulting in issues such as limited diversity and the creation of echo chambers. Current research addresses these challenges through proactive recommender systems by recommending a sequence of items (called influence path) to guide user interest in the target item. However, existing methods struggle to construct a coherent influence path that builds up with items the user is likely to enjoy. In this paper, we leverage the Large Language Model's (LLMs) exceptional ability for path planning and instruction following, introducing a novel approach named LLM-based Influence Path Planning (LLM-IPP). Our approach maintains coherence between consecutive recommendations and enhances user acceptability of the recommended items. To evaluate LLM-IPP, we implement various user simulators and metrics to measure user acceptability and path coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-IPP significantly outperforms traditional proactive recommender systems. This study pioneers the integration of LLMs into proactive recommender systems, offering a reliable and user-engaging methodology for future recommendation technologies.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

Most of these pursuits involve modern NLP detectors like T5-Sentinel and RoBERTa-Sentinel, without paying too much attention to issues of interpretability and explainability of these models. In our study, we provide a comprehensive analysis that shows that traditional ML models (Naive-Bayes,MLP, Random Forests, XGBoost) perform as well as modern NLP detectors, in human vs AI text detection. We achieve this by implementing a robust testing procedure on diverse datasets, including curated corpora and real-world samples. Subsequently, by employing the explainable AI technique LIME, we uncover parts of the input that contribute most to the prediction of each model, providing insights into the detection process. Our study contributes to the growing need for developing production-level LLM detection tools, which can leverage a wide range of traditional as well as modern NLP detectors we propose. Finally, the LIME techniques we demonstrate also have the potential to equip these detection tools with interpretability analysis features, making them more reliable and trustworthy in various domains like education, healthcare, and media.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[HowToCaption: Prompting LLMs to Transform Video Annotations at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04900v2)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instructional videos are a common source for learning text-video or even multimodal representations by leveraging subtitles extracted with automatic speech recognition systems (ASR) from the audio signal in the videos. However, in contrast to human-annotated captions, both speech and subtitles naturally differ from the visual content of the videos and thus provide only noisy supervision. As a result, large-scale annotation-free web video training data remains sub-optimal for training text-video models. In this work, we propose to leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to obtain high-quality video descriptions aligned with videos at scale. Specifically, we prompt an LLM to create plausible video captions based on ASR subtitles of instructional videos. To this end, we introduce a prompting method that is able to take into account a longer text of subtitles, allowing us to capture the contextual information beyond one single sentence. We further prompt the LLM to generate timestamps for each produced caption based on the timestamps of the subtitles and finally align the generated captions to the video temporally. In this way, we obtain human-style video captions at scale without human supervision. We apply our method to the subtitles of the HowTo100M dataset, creating a new large-scale dataset, HowToCaption. Our evaluation shows that the resulting captions not only significantly improve the performance over many different benchmark datasets for zero-shot text-video retrieval and video captioning, but also lead to a disentangling of textual narration from the audio, boosting the performance in text-video-audio tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ninatu/howtocaption</p></details> |

LLMs find applications in various fields and contribute significantly. Despite their powerful language capabilities, similar to pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs still face challenges in remembering events, incorporating new information, and addressing domain-specific issues or hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, some others have proposed the integration of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to provide factual context, thereby improving performance and delivering more accurate feedback to user queries. Education plays a crucial role in human development and progress. With the technology transformation, traditional education is being replaced by digital or blended education. Therefore, educational data in the digital environment is increasing day by day. Data in higher education institutions are diverse, comprising various sources such as unstructured/structured text, relational databases, web/app-based API access, etc. Constructing a Knowledge Graph from these cross-data sources is not a simple task. This article proposes a method for automatically constructing a Knowledge Graph from multiple data sources and discusses some initial applications (experimental trials) of KG in conjunction with LLMs for question-answering tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, Accepted at AIQAM '24: Proceedings of the 1st ACM Workshop on AI-Powered Q&A Systems for Multimedia</p></details> |

We leverage LLMs' common sense physical reasoning and code-writing abilities to infer an object's physical characteristics$\unicode{x2013}$mass $m$, friction coefficient $\mu$, and spring constant $k$$\unicode{x2013}$from a semantic description, and then translate those characteristics into an executable adaptive grasp policy. Using a two-finger gripper with a built-in depth camera that can control its torque by limiting motor current, we demonstrate that LLM-parameterized but first-principles grasp policies outperform both traditional adaptive grasp policies and direct LLM-as-code policies on a custom benchmark of 12 delicate and deformable items including food, produce, toys, and other everyday items, spanning two orders of magnitude in mass and required pick-up force. We then improve property estimation and grasp performance on variable size objects with model finetuning on property-based comparisons and eliciting such comparisons via chain-of-thought prompting. We also demonstrate how compliance feedback from DeliGrasp policies can aid in downstream tasks such as measuring produce ripeness.

We look at the range of stages in a review that can be automated and assess the current state-of-the-art research projects in the field. Materials and Methods: The search was conducted in June 2024 in PubMed, Scopus, Dimensions, and Google Scholar databases by human reviewers. Screening and extraction process took place in Covidence with the help of LLM add-on which uses OpenAI gpt-4o model. ChatGPT was used to clean extracted data and generate code for figures in this manuscript, ChatGPT and Scite.ai were used in drafting all components of the manuscript, except the methods and discussion sections. Results: 3,788 articles were retrieved, and 172 studies were deemed eligible for the final review. ChatGPT and GPT-based LLM emerged as the most dominant architecture for review automation (n=126, 73.2%). A significant number of review automation projects were found, but only a limited number of papers (n=26, 15.1%) were actual reviews that used LLM during their creation. Most citations focused on automation of a particular stage of review, such as Searching for publications (n=60, 34.9%), and Data extraction (n=54, 31.4%). When comparing pooled performance of GPT-based and BERT-based models, the former were better in data extraction with mean precision 83.0% (SD=10.4), and recall 86.0% (SD=9.8), while being slightly less accurate in title and abstract screening stage (Maccuracy=77.3%, SD=13.0). Discussion/Conclusion: Our LLM-assisted systematic review revealed a significant number of research projects related to review automation using LLMs. The results looked promising, and we anticipate that LLMs will change in the near future the way the scientific reviews are conducted.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 ma...</summary><p>18 main pages with 5 figures and 1 table, references, followed by supplementary materials</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness often hinges on the ability to effectively leverage extensive, long user historical data due to its inherent noise and length of such data. Existing pretrained LLMs may generate summaries that are concise but lack the necessary context for downstream tasks, hindering their utility in personalization systems. To address these challenges, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Prediction Feedback (RLPF). RLPF fine-tunes LLMs to generate concise, human-readable user summaries that are optimized for downstream task performance. By maximizing the usefulness of the generated summaries, RLPF effectively distills extensive user history data while preserving essential information for downstream tasks. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in both extrinsic downstream task utility and intrinsic summary quality, surpassing baseline methods by up to 22% on downstream task performance and achieving an up to 84.59% win rate on Factuality, Abstractiveness, and Readability. RLPF also achieves a remarkable 74% reduction in context length while improving performance on 16 out of 19 unseen tasks and/or datasets, showcasing its generalizability. This approach offers a promising solution for enhancing LLM personalization by effectively transforming long, noisy user histories into informative and human-readable representations.</p></details> |  |

However, patients often face challenges due to concerns about stigma. The use of social robots and chatbots to support sensitive disclosures is gaining traction, especially with the emergence of LLM models. Yet, numerous technical, ethical, privacy, safety, efficacy, and reporting concerns must be carefully addressed in this context. In this position paper, we focus on the example of HIV status disclosure, examining key opportunities, technical considerations, and risks associated with LLM-backed social robotics.</p></details> |  |

More often than not, these online contracts spanning double-digit pages are signed blindly by users who simply want immediate access to the desired service. What would normally require a consultation with a legal team, has now become a mundane activity consisting of a few clicks where users potentially sign away their rights, for instance in terms of their data privacy, to countless online entities/companies. Large language models (LLMs) are good at parsing long text-based documents, and could potentially be adopted to help users when dealing with dubious clauses in ToS and their underlying privacy policies. To investigate the utility of existing models for this task, we first build a dataset consisting of 12 questions applied individually to a set of privacy policies crawled from popular websites. Thereafter, a series of open-source as well as commercial chatbots such as ChatGPT, are queried over each question, with the answers being compared to a given ground truth. Our results show that some open-source models are able to provide a higher accuracy compared to some commercial models. However, the best performance is recorded from a commercial chatbot (ChatGPT4). Overall, all models perform only slightly better than random at this task. Consequently, their performance needs to be significantly improved before they can be adopted at large for this purpose.</p></details> |  |

While much research has addressed racial and gender biases, age bias remains little explored. The scarcity of instruction-tuning and preference datasets for age bias hampers its detection and measurement, and existing fine-tuning methods seldom address age-related fairness. In this paper, we construct age bias preference datasets and instruction-tuning datasets for RLHF. We introduce ARG, an age fairness reward to reduce differences in the response quality of LLMs across different age groups. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reward significantly improves response accuracy and reduces performance disparities across age groups.

However, high-quality metadata creation and enrichment often require manual annotations, which is a labour-intensive and challenging process to automate. In this study, we propose a method to support metadata enrichment using topic annotations generated by three Large Language Models (LLMs): ChatGPT-3.5, GoogleBard, and GoogleGemini. Our analysis focuses on classifying column headers based on domain-specific topics from the Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA), a Linked Data controlled vocabulary. Our approach operates in a zero-shot setting, integrating the controlled topic vocabulary directly within the input prompt. This integration serves as a Large Context Windows approach, with the aim of improving the results of the topic classification task. We evaluated the performance of the LLMs in terms of internal consistency, inter-machine alignment, and agreement with human classification. Additionally, we investigate the impact of contextual information (i.e., dataset description) on the classification outcomes. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT and GoogleGemini outperform GoogleBard in terms of internal consistency as well as LLM-human-agreement. Interestingly, we found that contextual information had no significant impact on LLM performance. This work proposes a novel approach that leverages LLMs for topic classification of column headers using a controlled vocabulary, presenting a practical application of LLMs and Large Context Windows within the Semantic Web domain. This approach has the potential to facilitate automated metadata enrichment, thereby enhancing dataset retrieval and the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) of research data on the Web.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning vs Retrieval: The Role of In-Context Examples in Regression with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04318v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of being in-context learners. However, the underlying mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) is still a major research question, and experimental research results about how models exploit ICL are not always consistent. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating in-context learning mechanisms, which we claim are a combination of retrieving internal knowledge and learning from in-context examples by focusing on regression tasks. First, we show that LLMs can perform regression on real-world datasets and then design experiments to measure the extent to which the LLM retrieves its internal knowledge versus learning from in-context examples. We argue that this process lies on a spectrum between these two extremes. We provide an in-depth analysis of the degrees to which these mechanisms are triggered depending on various factors, such as prior knowledge about the tasks and the type and richness of the information provided by the in-context examples. We employ three LLMs and utilize multiple datasets to corroborate the robustness of our findings. Our results shed light on how to engineer prompts to leverage meta-learning from in-context examples and foster knowledge retrieval depending on the problem being addressed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining LLMs and Knowledge Graphs to Reduce Hallucinations in Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04181v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in natural language processing have revolutionized the way we can interact with digital information systems, such as databases, making them more accessible. However, challenges persist, especially when accuracy is critical, as in the biomedical domain. A key issue is the hallucination problem, where models generate information unsupported by the underlying data, potentially leading to dangerous misinformation. This paper presents a novel approach designed to bridge this gap by combining Large Language Models (LLM) and Knowledge Graphs (KG) to improve the accuracy and reliability of question-answering systems, on the example of a biomedical KG. Built on the LangChain framework, our method incorporates a query checker that ensures the syntactical and semantic validity of LLM-generated queries, which are then used to extract information from a Knowledge Graph, substantially reducing errors like hallucinations. We evaluated the overall performance using a new benchmark dataset of 50 biomedical questions, testing several LLMs, including GPT-4 Turbo and llama3:70b. Our results indicate that while GPT-4 Turbo outperforms other models in generating accurate queries, open-source models like llama3:70b show promise with appropriate prompt engineering. To make this approach accessible, a user-friendly web-based interface has been developed, allowing users to input natural language queries, view generated and corrected Cypher queries, and verify the resulting paths for accuracy. Overall, this hybrid approach effectively addresses common issues such as data gaps and hallucinations, offering a reliable and intuitive solution for question answering systems. The source code for generating the results of this paper and for the user-interface can be found in our Git repository: https://git.zib.de/lpusch/cyphergenkg-gui</p></details> |  |

LLM judges are typically evaluated by measuring the correlation with human judgments on generation tasks such as summarization or machine translation. In contrast, we study LLM judges on mathematical reasoning tasks. These tasks require multi-step reasoning, and the correctness of their solutions is verifiable, enabling a more objective evaluation. We perform a detailed performance analysis and find that the used judges are mostly unable to improve task performance but are able to pick the better model. Our analysis uncovers a strong correlation between judgment performance and the candidate model task performance. We observe that judges tend to choose the model of higher quality even if its answer is incorrect. Further, we show that it is possible to use statistics, such as the task performances of the individual models, to predict judgment performance. In an ablation, we either swap or mask the candidate answers and observe that judges often keep the original judgment, providing evidence that judges incorporate writing style in their judgments. In summary, we find that regularities in the judgments are quantifiable using statistical measures and provide various angles on exploiting them.</p></details> |  |

We formulate the Quantization Error Minimization (QEM) problem as minimizing the distance between a matrix before and after quantization, under the condition that the quantized matrix occupies the same memory space. Matrix quantization is crucial in various applications, including Large Language Models (LLMs) weight quantization, vector databases, KV cache quantization, graph compression, and image compression. Recent advancements in LLMs, such as GPT-4 and BERT, have highlighted the importance of matrix compression due to the large size of parameters and KV cache, which are stored as matrices. We propose Quantum Entanglement Trees (QET) to address the QEM problem by leveraging the local orderliness of matrix elements, involving iterative element swapping to form a locally ordered matrix. This matrix is then grouped and quantized by columns. To enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: further quantizing residuals to reduce MSE, and using masking and batch processing to accelerate the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that QET can effectively reduce MSE to 5.05%, 13.33%, and 11.89% of the current best method on the LLM dataset, K cache, and V cache, respectively. Our contributions include the abstraction of the QEM problem, the design of the QET algorithm, and the proposal of two optimizations to improve accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  |

A Large-Scale Human Study with 100+ NLP Researchers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04109v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked optimism about their potential to accelerate scientific discovery, with a growing number of works proposing research agents that autonomously generate and validate new ideas. Despite this, no evaluations have shown that LLM systems can take the very first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the entire research process. We address this by establishing an experimental design that evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and performs the first head-to-head comparison between expert NLP researchers and an LLM ideation agent. By recruiting over 100 NLP researchers to write novel ideas and blind reviews of both LLM and human ideas, we obtain the first statistically significant conclusion on current LLM capabilities for research ideation: we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p < 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility. Studying our agent baselines closely, we identify open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including failures of LLM self-evaluation and their lack of diversity in generation. Finally, we acknowledge that human judgements of novelty can be difficult, even by experts, and propose an end-to-end study design which recruits researchers to execute these ideas into full projects, enabling us to study whether these novelty and feasibility judgements result in meaningful differences in research outcome.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main paper is 20 pages</p></details> |

Under the rationale that the learning process of the poetry generation systems should be more human-like and their output more diverse and novel, we introduce a framework based on social learning where we emphasize non-cooperative interactions besides cooperative interactions to encourage diversity. Our experiments are the first attempt at LLM-based multi-agent systems in non-cooperative environments for poetry generation employing both TRAINING-BASED agents (GPT-2) and PROMPTING-BASED agents (GPT-3 and GPT-4). Our evaluation based on 96k generated poems shows that our framework benefits the poetry generation process for TRAINING-BASED agents resulting in 1) a 3.0-3.7 percentage point (pp) increase in diversity and a 5.6-11.3 pp increase in novelty according to distinct and novel n-grams. The generated poetry from TRAINING-BASED agents also exhibits group divergence in terms of lexicons, styles and semantics. PROMPTING-BASED agents in our framework also benefit from non-cooperative environments and a more diverse ensemble of models with non-homogeneous agents has the potential to further enhance diversity, with an increase of 7.0-17.5 pp according to our experiments. However, PROMPTING-BASED agents show a decrease in lexical diversity over time and do not exhibit the group-based divergence intended in the social network. Our paper argues for a paradigm shift in creative tasks such as automatic poetry generation to include social learning processes (via LLM-based agent modeling) similar to human interaction.</p></details> | preprint |

With the advent of lightweight LLM models and specially designed GPUs, on-device LLM inference has achieved the necessary accuracy and performance metrics. However, we have identified that LLM inference on GPUs can leak privacy-sensitive intermediate information, specifically the KV pairs. An attacker could exploit these KV pairs to reconstruct the entire user conversation, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Existing solutions, such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), are either too computation-intensive or resource-limited. To address these issues, we designed KV-Shield, which operates in two phases. In the initialization phase, it permutes the weight matrices so that all KV pairs are correspondingly permuted. During the runtime phase, the attention vector is inversely permuted to ensure the correctness of the layer output. All permutation-related operations are executed within the TEE, ensuring that insecure GPUs cannot access the original KV pairs, thus preventing conversation reconstruction. Finally, we theoretically analyze the correctness of KV-Shield, along with its advantages and overhead.</p></details> |  |

This issue is particularly pronounced in clinical dialogue summarization, a low-resource domain where supervised data for fine-tuning is scarce, necessitating the use of ASR models as black-box solutions. Employing conventional data augmentation for enhancing the noise robustness of summarization models is not feasible either due to the unavailability of sufficient medical dialogue audio recordings and corresponding ASR transcripts. To address this challenge, we propose MEDSAGE, an approach for generating synthetic samples for data augmentation using Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we leverage the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs and instruct them to generate ASR-like errors based on a few available medical dialogue examples with audio recordings. Experimental results show that LLMs can effectively model ASR noise, and incorporating this noisy data into the training process significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of medical dialogue summarization systems. This approach addresses the challenges of noisy ASR outputs in critical applications, offering a robust solution to enhance the reliability of clinical dialogue summarization.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we examine the topic of LLM planning for a set of continuously parameterized skills whose execution must avoid violations of a set of kinematic, geometric, and physical constraints. We prompt the LLM to output code for a function with open parameters, which, together with environmental constraints, can be viewed as a Continuous Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CCSP). This CCSP can be solved through sampling or optimization to find a skill sequence and continuous parameter settings that achieve the goal while avoiding constraint violations. Additionally, we consider cases where the LLM proposes unsatisfiable CCSPs, such as those that are kinematically infeasible, dynamically unstable, or lead to collisions, and re-prompt the LLM to form a new CCSP accordingly. Experiments across three different simulated 3D domains demonstrate that our proposed strategy, PRoC3S, is capable of solving a wide range of complex manipulation tasks with realistic constraints on continuous parameters much more efficiently and effectively than existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

For this to be true, LLMs would need to be better at discriminating among previously-generated alternatives, than generating initial responses. We explore the validity of this hypothesis in practice. We first formulate a unified framework that allows us to compare the generative and discriminative capability of any model on any task. In our resulting experimental analysis of several open-source and industrial LLMs, we observe that models are not reliably better at discriminating among previously-generated alternatives than generating initial responses. This finding challenges the notion that LLMs may be able to enhance their performance only through their own judgment.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that enriching prompts with domain-specific insights can improve both the quality and efficiency of data generation. To test this hypothesis, we explore three prompt construction protocols: Expert-guided, LLM-guided, and Novel-Mapping. Through empirical studies with the recently proposed GReaT framework, we find that context-enriched prompts lead to significantly improved data generation quality and training efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing LLMs for Cross-City OD Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03937v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting Origin-Destination (OD) flows is crucial for urban planning and transportation management. Traditional OD prediction models, while effective within single cities, often face limitations when applied across different cities due to varied traffic conditions, urban layouts, and socio-economic factors. In this paper, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a new method for cross-city OD flow prediction. Our approach leverages the advanced semantic understanding and contextual learning capabilities of LLMs to bridge the gap between cities with different characteristics, providing a robust and adaptable solution for accurate OD flow prediction that can be transferred from one city to another. Our novel framework involves four major components: collecting OD training datasets from a source city, instruction-tuning the LLMs, predicting destination POIs in a target city, and identifying the locations that best match the predicted destination POIs. We introduce a new loss function that integrates POI semantics and trip distance during training. By extracting high-quality semantic features from human mobility and POI data, the model understands spatial and functional relationships within urban spaces and captures interactions between individuals and various POIs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art learning-based methods in cross-city OD flow prediction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 18 figures |

The rapid evolution of LLMs presents opportunities for developers to enhance applications continuously. However, this constant adaptation can also lead to performance regressions during model migrations. While several interactive tools have been proposed to streamline the complexity of prompt engineering, few address the specific requirements of regression testing for LLM Migrations. To bridge this gap, we introduce RETAIN (REgression Testing guided LLM migrAtIoN), a tool designed explicitly for regression testing in LLM Migrations. RETAIN comprises two key components: an interactive interface tailored to regression testing needs during LLM migrations, and an error discovery module that facilitates understanding of differences in model behaviors. The error discovery module generates textual descriptions of various errors or differences between model outputs, providing actionable insights for prompt refinement. Our automatic evaluation and empirical user studies demonstrate that RETAIN, when compared to manual evaluation, enabled participants to identify twice as many errors, facilitated experimentation with 75% more prompts, and achieves 12% higher metric scores in a given time frame.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Sirius: Contextual Sparsity with Correction for Efficient LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03856v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the blossom of large language models (LLMs), inference efficiency becomes increasingly important. Various approximation methods are proposed to reduce the cost at inference time. Contextual Sparsity (CS) is appealing for its training-free nature and its ability to reach a higher compression ratio seemingly without quality degradation. However, after a comprehensive evaluation of contextual sparsity methods on various complex generation tasks, we find that although CS succeeds in prompt-understanding tasks, CS significantly degrades the model performance for reasoning, deduction, and knowledge-based tasks. Despite the gap in end-to-end accuracy, we observed that sparse models often share general problem-solving logic and require only a few token corrections to recover the original model performance. This paper introduces Sirius, an efficient correction mechanism, which significantly recovers CS models quality on reasoning tasks while maintaining its efficiency gain. Sirius is evaluated on 6 models with 8 difficult generation tasks in reasoning, math, and coding and shows consistent effectiveness and efficiency. Also, we carefully develop a system implementation for Sirius and show that Sirius achieves roughly 20% reduction in latency for 8B model on-chip and 35% reduction for 70B model offloading. We open-source our implementation of Sirius at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/Sirius.git.</p></details> |  |

Empowering Code Instruction Tuning with High-Quality Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03810v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying how to construct better code instruction tuning data. However, we observe Code models trained with these datasets exhibit high performance on HumanEval but perform worse on other benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench. Upon further investigation, we find that many datasets suffer from severe data leakage. After cleaning up most of the leaked data, some well-known high-quality datasets perform poorly. This discovery reveals a new challenge: identifying which dataset genuinely qualify as high-quality code instruction data. To address this, we propose an efficient code data pruning strategy for selecting good samples. Our approach is based on three dimensions: instruction complexity, response quality, and instruction diversity. Based on our selected data, we present XCoder, a family of models finetuned from LLaMA3. Our experiments show XCoder achieves new state-of-the-art performance using fewer training data, which verify the effectiveness of our data strategy. Moreover, we perform a comprehensive analysis on the data composition and find existing code datasets have different characteristics according to their construction methods, which provide new insights for future code LLMs. Our models and dataset are released in https://github.com/banksy23/XCoder</p></details> | Working in progress |

We hypothesize that a core missing component is a lack of diverse LLM outputs, leading to inefficient search due to models repeatedly sampling highly similar, yet incorrect generations. We empirically demonstrate that this lack of diversity can be mitigated by searching over candidate plans for solving a problem in natural language. Based on this insight, we propose PLANSEARCH, a novel search algorithm which shows strong results across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and LiveCodeBench (a contamination-free benchmark for competitive coding). PLANSEARCH generates a diverse set of observations about the problem and then uses these observations to construct plans for solving the problem. By searching over plans in natural language rather than directly over code solutions, PLANSEARCH explores a significantly more diverse range of potential solutions compared to baseline search methods. Using PLANSEARCH on top of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves a state-of-the-art pass@200 of 77.0% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming both the best score achieved without search (pass@1 = 41.4%) and using standard repeated sampling (pass@200 = 60.6%). Finally, we show that, across all models, search algorithms, and benchmarks analyzed, we can accurately predict performance gains due to search as a direct function of the diversity over generated ideas.</p></details> |  |

However, delivering a practical jailbreak defense is challenging because it needs to not only handle all the above jailbreak attacks but also incur negligible delays to user prompts, as well as be compatible with both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Inspired by how the traditional security concept of shadow stacks defends against memory overflow attacks, this paper introduces a generic LLM jailbreak defense framework called SelfDefend, which establishes a shadow LLM as a defense instance to concurrently protect the target LLM instance in the normal stack and collaborate with it for checkpoint-based access control. The effectiveness of SelfDefend builds upon our observation that existing LLMs (both target and defense LLMs) have the capability to identify harmful prompts or intentions in user queries, which we empirically validate using the commonly used GPT-3.5/4 models across all major jailbreak attacks. To further improve the defense's robustness and minimize costs, we employ a data distillation approach to tune dedicated open-source defense models. These models outperform six state-of-the-art defenses and match the performance of GPT-4-based SelfDefend, with significantly lower extra delays. We also empirically show that the tuned models are robust to adaptive jailbreaks and prompt injections.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper completes its earlier vision paper, available at arXiv:2402.15727.

This problem is very challenging, because it requires agent to establish self-position and acquire spatial representation of complex urban environment, where landmarks are often invisible. In the absence of navigation instructions, such abilities are vital for the agent to make high-quality decisions in long-range city navigation. With the emergent reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), a tempting baseline is to prompt LLMs to "react" on each observation and make decisions accordingly. However, this baseline has very poor performance that the agent often repeatedly visits same locations and make short-sighted, inconsistent decisions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel agentic workflow featured by its abilities to perceive, reflect and plan. Specifically, we find LLaVA-7B can be fine-tuned to perceive the direction and distance of landmarks with sufficient accuracy for city navigation. Moreover, reflection is achieved through a memory mechanism, where past experiences are stored and can be retrieved with current perception for effective decision argumentation. Planning uses reflection results to produce long-term plans, which can avoid short-sighted decisions in long-range navigation. We show the designed workflow significantly improves navigation ability of the LLM agent compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The experiment and dataset are not enough, and we need more experiments to verify our model</p></details> |

In this work, we show that the importance of the latter role might be overestimated. To show that, we start by manipulating the representations of previous tokens; e.g. by replacing the hidden states at some layer k with random vectors. Our experimenting with four LLMs and four tasks show that this operation often leads to small to negligible drop in performance. Importantly, this happens if the manipulation occurs in the top part of the model-k is in the final 30-50% of the layers. In contrast, doing the same manipulation in earlier layers might lead to chance level performance. We continue by switching the hidden state of certain tokens with hidden states of other tokens from another prompt; e.g., replacing the word "Italy" with "France" in "What is the capital of Italy?". We find that when applying this switch in the top 1/3 of the model, the model ignores it (answering "Rome"). However if we apply it before, the model conforms to the switch ("Paris"). Our results hint at a two stage process in transformer-based LLMs: the first part gathers input from previous tokens, while the second mainly processes that information internally.</p></details> |  |

However, current efforts in this area are preliminary, lacking clarity on whether LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capabilities stem from the models themselves or external aids such as knowledge retrieval and tooling support. This paper aims to isolate LLMs' vulnerability reasoning from other capabilities, such as vulnerability knowledge adoption, context information retrieval, and structured output generation. We introduce LLM4Vuln, a unified evaluation framework that separates and assesses LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capabilities and examines improvements when combined with other enhancements. We conducted controlled experiments with 97 ground-truth vulnerabilities and 97 non-vulnerable cases in Solidity and Java, testing them in a total of 9,312 scenarios across four LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral, and Llama 3). Our findings reveal the varying impacts of knowledge enhancement, context supplementation, prompt schemes, and models. Additionally, we identified 14 zero-day vulnerabilities in four pilot bug bounty programs, resulting in \$3,576 in bounties.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a technical report by Nanyang Technological University.

To do so, a possibility is to evaluate the considered LLM on a set of task instances and train an assessor to predict its performance based on features of the instances. However, this approach requires evaluating each new LLM on a sufficiently large set of task instances to train an assessor specific to it. In this work, we leverage the evaluation results of previously tested LLMs to reduce the number of evaluations required to predict the performance of a new LLM. In practice, we propose to test the new LLM on a small set of reference instances and train a generic assessor which predicts the performance of the LLM on an instance based on the performance of the former on the reference set and features of the instance of interest. We conduct empirical studies on HELM-Lite and KindsOfReasoning, a collection of existing reasoning datasets that we introduce, where we evaluate all instruction-fine-tuned OpenAI models until the January 2024 version of GPT4. When predicting performance on instances with the same distribution as those used to train the generic assessor, we find this achieves performance comparable to the LLM-specific assessors trained on the full set of instances. Additionally, we find that randomly selecting the reference instances performs as well as some advanced selection methods we tested. For out of distribution, however, no clear winner emerges and the overall performance is worse, suggesting that the inherent predictability of LLMs is low.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2024 KDD workshop on Evaluation and Trustworthiness of Generative AI Models</p></details> |

Quantifying LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12334v2)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</p></details> |  |

However, they often overlook the correlation between these channels, leading to color distortion and artifacts in the reconstructed image. To address this, we present Quaternion Nuclear Norm Minus Frobenius Norm Minimization (QNMF), a novel approach for color image reconstruction. QNMF utilizes quaternion algebra to capture the relationships among RGB channels comprehensively. By employing a regularization technique that involves nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm, QNMF approximates the underlying low-rank structure of quaternion-encoded color images. Theoretical proofs are provided to ensure the method's mathematical integrity. Demonstrating versatility and efficacy, the QNMF regularizer excels in various color low-level vision tasks, including denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and random impulse noise removal, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by Pattern Recognition on September 5, 2024</p></details> |
| **[In-Loop Filtering via Trained Look-Up Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10926v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology for removing the artifacts in image/video coding standards. Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Many end-to-end specialized models based on deep learning (DL) have been proposed, yet the scale and performance of these models are limited by the size of dataset. Given the superior parameter scales and feature representations of pre-trained models, they exhibit outstanding performance when transferred to downstream tasks with small datasets. Therefore, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method, namely PanAdapter, which utilizes additional advanced semantic information from pre-trained models to alleviate the issue of small-scale datasets in pansharpening tasks. Specifically, targeting the large domain discrepancy between image restoration and pansharpening tasks, the PanAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy for progressively adapting to the downstream task. In the first stage, we fine-tune the pre-trained CNN model and extract task-specific priors at two scales by proposed Local Prior Extraction (LPE) module. In the second stage, we feed the extracted two-scale priors into two branches of cascaded adapters respectively. At each adapter, we design two parameter-efficient modules for allowing the two branches to interact and be injected into the frozen pre-trained VisionTransformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that by only training the proposed LPE modules and adapters with a small number of parameters, our approach can benefit from pre-trained image restoration models and achieve state-of-the-art performance in several benchmark pansharpening datasets. The code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Multiscale Feature Fusion Super-Resolution Network Based on Two-branch Convolution and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06590v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The single image super-resolution(SISR) algorithms under deep learning currently have two main models, one based on convolutional neural networks and the other based on Transformer. The former uses the stacking of convolutional layers with different convolutional kernel sizes to design the model, which enables the model to better extract the local features of the image; the latter uses the self-attention mechanism to design the model, which allows the model to establish long-distance dependencies between image pixel points through the self-attention mechanism and then better extract the global features of the image. However, both of the above methods face their problems. Based on this, this paper proposes a new lightweight multi-scale feature fusion network model based on two-way complementary convolutional and Transformer, which integrates the respective features of Transformer and convolutional neural networks through a two-branch network architecture, to realize the mutual fusion of global and local information. Meanwhile, considering the partial loss of information caused by the low-pixel images trained by the deep neural network, this paper designs a modular connection method of multi-stage feature supplementation to fuse the feature maps extracted from the shallow stage of the model with those extracted from the deep stage of the model, to minimize the loss of the information in the feature images that is beneficial to the image restoration as much as possible, to facilitate the obtaining of a higher-quality restored image. The practical results finally show that the model proposed in this paper is optimal in image recovery performance when compared with other lightweight models with the same amount of parameters.</p></details> | 11 pages,12 figures |
| **[Multi-Weather Image Restoration via Histogram-Based Transformer Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06334v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, the mainstream restoration tasks under adverse weather conditions have predominantly focused on single-weather scenarios. However, in reality, multiple weather conditions always coexist and their degree of mixing is usually unknown. Under such complex and diverse weather conditions, single-weather restoration models struggle to meet practical demands. This is particularly critical in fields such as autonomous driving, where there is an urgent need for a model capable of effectively handling mixed weather conditions and enhancing image quality in an automated manner. In this paper, we propose a Task Sequence Generator module that, in conjunction with the Task Intra-patch Block, effectively extracts task-specific features embedded in degraded images. The Task Intra-patch Block introduces an external learnable sequence that aids the network in capturing task-specific information. Additionally, we employ a histogram-based transformer module as the backbone of our network, enabling the capture of both global and local dynamic range features. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.03249</p></details> |

Nevertheless, most of transformer-based models are strictly bounded by exorbitant memory occupancy. Our goal is to reduce the memory consumption of Swin Transformer and at the same time speed up the model during training process. Thus, we introduce AgileIR, group shifted attention mechanism along with window attention, which sparsely simplifies the model in architecture. We propose Group Shifted Window Attention (GSWA) to decompose Shift Window Multi-head Self Attention (SW-MSA) and Window Multi-head Self Attention (W-MSA) into groups across their attention heads, contributing to shrinking memory usage in back propagation. In addition to that, we keep shifted window masking and its shifted learnable biases during training, in order to induce the model interacting across windows within the channel. We also re-allocate projection parameters to accelerate attention matrix calculation, which we found a negligible decrease in performance. As a result of experiment, compared with our baseline SwinIR and other efficient quantization models, AgileIR keeps the performance still at 32.20 dB on Set5 evaluation dataset, exceeding other methods with tailor-made efficient methods and saves over 50% memory while a large batch size is employed.</p></details> |  |

Despite its innovative approach to seamless display integration, UDC technology faces unique image degradation challenges exacerbated by the susceptibility to adversarial perturbations. Our research initially conducts an in-depth robustness evaluation of deep-learning-based UDC image restoration models by employing several white-box and black-box attacking methods. This evaluation is pivotal in understanding the vulnerabilities of current UDC image restoration techniques. Following the assessment, we introduce a defense framework integrating adversarial purification with subsequent fine-tuning processes. First, our approach employs diffusion-based adversarial purification, effectively neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Then, we apply the fine-tuning methodologies to refine the image restoration models further, ensuring that the quality and fidelity of the restored images are maintained. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments, showing marked improvements in resilience against typical adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Power Line Aerial Image Restoration under dverse Weather: Datasets and Baselines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04812v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power Line Autonomous Inspection (PLAI) plays a crucial role in the construction of smart grids due to its great advantages of low cost, high efficiency, and safe operation. PLAI is completed by accurately detecting the electrical components and defects in the aerial images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the visible quality of aerial images is inevitably degraded by adverse weather like haze, rain, or snow, which are found to drastically decrease the detection accuracy in our research. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new task of Power Line Aerial Image Restoration under Adverse Weather (PLAIR-AW), which aims to recover clean and high-quality images from degraded images with bad weather thus improving detection performance for PLAI. In this context, we are the first to release numerous corresponding datasets, namely, HazeCPLID, HazeTTPLA, HazeInsPLAD for power line aerial image dehazing, RainCPLID, RainTTPLA, RainInsPLAD for power line aerial image deraining, SnowCPLID, SnowInsPLAD for power line aerial image desnowing, which are synthesized upon the public power line aerial image datasets of CPLID, TTPLA, InsPLAD following the mathematical models. Meanwhile, we select numerous state-of-the-art methods from image restoration community as the baseline methods for PLAIR-AW. At last, we conduct large-scale empirical experiments to evaluate the performance of baseline methods on the proposed datasets. The proposed datasets and trained models are available at https://github.com/ntuhubin/PLAIR-AW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Bayesian image restoration by Langevin sampling with a denoising diffusion implicit prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04384v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion methods provide a powerful strategy to solve image restoration tasks by flexibly combining a pre-trained foundational prior model with a likelihood function specified during test time. Such methods are predominantly derived from two stochastic processes: reversing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, which underpins the celebrated denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM), and the Langevin diffusion process. The solutions delivered by DDPM and DDIM are often remarkably realistic, but they are not always consistent with measurements because of likelihood intractability issues and the associated required approximations. Alternatively, using a Langevin process circumvents the intractable likelihood issue, but usually leads to restoration results of inferior quality and longer computing times. This paper presents a novel and highly computationally efficient image restoration method that carefully embeds a foundational DDPM denoiser within an empirical Bayesian Langevin algorithm, which jointly calibrates key model hyper-parameters as it estimates the model's posterior mean. Extensive experimental results on three canonical tasks (image deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting) demonstrate that the proposed approach improves on state-of-the-art strategies both in image estimation accuracy and computing time.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Data-free distillation provides an alternative for allowing to learn a lightweight student model from a pre-trained teacher model without relying on the original training data. The existing data-free learning methods mainly optimize the models with the pseudo data generated by GANs or the real data collected from the Internet. However, they inevitably suffer from the problems of unstable training or domain shifts with the original data. In this paper, we propose a novel Data-free Distillation with Degradation-prompt Diffusion framework for multi-weather Image Restoration (D4IR). It replaces GANs with pre-trained diffusion models to avoid model collapse and incorporates a degradation-aware prompt adapter to facilitate content-driven conditional diffusion for generating domain-related images. Specifically, a contrast-based degradation prompt adapter is firstly designed to capture degradation-aware prompts from web-collected degraded images. Then, the collected unpaired clean images are perturbed to latent features of stable diffusion, and conditioned with the degradation-aware prompts to synthesize new domain-related degraded images for knowledge distillation. Experiments illustrate that our proposal achieves comparable performance to the model distilled with original training data, and is even superior to other mainstream unsupervised methods.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world weather conditions often consist of a mixture of several weather types, and the degree of weather mixing in autonomous driving scenarios remains unknown. In the presence of complex and diverse weather conditions, a single weather removal model often encounters challenges in producing clear images from severe weather images. Therefore, there is a need for the development of multi-task severe weather removal models that can effectively handle mixed weather conditions and improve image quality in autonomous driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-task severe weather removal model that can effectively handle complex weather conditions in an adaptive manner. Our model incorporates a weather task sequence generator, enabling the self-attention mechanism to selectively focus on features specific to different weather types. To tackle the challenge of repairing large areas of weather degradation, we introduce Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) to increase the receptive field. Additionally, we propose an adaptive upsampling technique that effectively processes both the weather task information and underlying image features by selectively retaining relevant information. Our proposed model has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures and 2 table</p></details> |
| **[Perceptual-Distortion Balanced Image Super-Resolution is a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03179v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) models using pixel-based regression losses can achieve high distortion metrics scores (e.g., PSNR and SSIM), but often results in blurry images due to insufficient recovery of high-frequency details. Conversely, using GAN or perceptual losses can produce sharp images with high perceptual metric scores (e.g., LPIPS), but may introduce artifacts and incorrect textures. Balancing these two types of losses can help achieve a trade-off between distortion and perception, but the challenge lies in tuning the loss function weights. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) into the training process of SISR models to balance perceptual quality and distortion. We conceptualize the relationship between loss weights and image quality assessment (IQA) metrics as black-box objective functions to be optimized within our Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization Super-Resolution (MOBOSR) framework. This approach automates the hyperparameter tuning process, reduces overall computational cost, and enables the use of numerous loss functions simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOBOSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both perceptual quality and distortion, significantly advancing the perception-distortion Pareto frontier. Our work points towards a new direction for future research on balancing perceptual quality and fidelity in nearly all image restoration tasks.

We formulate a semi-supervised learning framework employing vision-language models to enhance restoration performance across diverse adverse weather conditions in real-world settings. Our approach involves assessing image clearness and providing semantics using vision-language models on real data, serving as supervision signals for training restoration models. For clearness enhancement, we use real-world data, utilizing a dual-step strategy with pseudo-labels assessed by vision-language models and weather prompt learning. For semantic enhancement, we integrate real-world data by adjusting weather conditions in vision-language model descriptions while preserving semantic meaning. Additionally, we introduce an effective training strategy to bootstrap restoration performance. Our approach achieves superior results in real-world adverse weather image restoration, demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, their performance is limited due to the dependency of FT on stationary signals and its lack of capability to extract spatial-frequency properties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT), a unified spatial-frequency representation leveraging both spatial and frequency components simultaneously, making it ideal for processing non-stationary signals like images. Specifically, we introduce a Fractional Fourier Transformer (F2former), where we combine the classical fractional Fourier based Wiener deconvolution (F2WD) as well as a multi-branch encoder-decoder transformer based on a new fractional frequency aware transformer block (F2TB). We design F2TB consisting of a fractional frequency aware self-attention (F2SA) to estimate element-wise product attention based on important frequency components and a novel feed-forward network based on frequency division multiplexing (FM-FFN) to refine high and low frequency features separately for efficient latent clear image restoration. Experimental results for the cases of both motion deblurring as well as defocus deblurring show that the performance of our proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 21 figures |

By iterating over these prompts, Restorer can handle composite degradation in real-world scenarios without requiring additional training.Based on these designs, Restorer with one set of parameters demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to existing all-in-one and even single-task models.Additionally, Restorer is efficient during inference, suggesting the potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing learning-based point cloud upsampling methods are constrained by computational resources and batch processing strategies, which often require subdividing point clouds into smaller patches, leading to distortions that degrade perceptual quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 2D-3D hybrid colored point cloud upsampling framework (GaussianPU) based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for robotic perception. This approach leverages 3DGS to bridge 3D point clouds with their 2D rendered images in robot vision systems. A dual scale rendered image restoration network transforms sparse point cloud renderings into dense representations, which are then input into 3DGS along with precise robot camera poses and interpolated sparse point clouds to reconstruct dense 3D point clouds. We have made a series of enhancements to the vanilla 3DGS, enabling precise control over the number of points and significantly boosting the quality of the upsampled point cloud for robotic scene understanding. Our framework supports processing entire point clouds on a single consumer-grade GPU, such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, eliminating the need for segmentation and thus producing high-quality, dense colored point clouds with millions of points for robot navigation and manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental results on generating million-level point cloud data validate the effectiveness of our method, substantially improving the quality of colored point clouds and demonstrating significant potential for applications involving large-scale point clouds in autonomous robotics and human-robot interaction scenarios.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Accurate Forgetting for All-in-One Image Restoration Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00685v1)** | 2024-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy protection has always been an ongoing topic, especially for AI. Currently, a low-cost scheme called Machine Unlearning forgets the private data remembered in the model. Specifically, given a private dataset and a trained neural network, we need to use e.g. pruning, fine-tuning, and gradient ascent to remove the influence of the private dataset on the neural network. Inspired by this, we try to use this concept to bridge the gap between the fields of image restoration and security, creating a new research idea. We propose the scene for the All-In-One model (a neural network that restores a wide range of degraded information), where a given dataset such as haze, or rain, is private and needs to be eliminated from the influence of it on the trained model. Notably, we find great challenges in this task to remove the influence of sensitive data while ensuring that the overall model performance remains robust, which is akin to directing a symphony orchestra without specific instruments while keeping the playing soothing. Here we explore a simple but effective approach: Instance-wise Unlearning through the use of adversarial examples and gradient ascent techniques. Our approach is a low-cost solution compared to the strategy of retraining the model from scratch, where the gradient ascent trick forgets the specified data and the performance of the adversarial sample maintenance model is robust. Through extensive experimentation on two popular unified image restoration models, we show that our approach effectively preserves knowledge of remaining data while unlearning a given degradation type.</p></details> |  |

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |

We collect 2600 high-quality real-world images, each with detailed descriptive text, for training the model. The proposed method is evaluated on standard benchmarks and achieves excellent performance, demonstrated by higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), lower learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and higher structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) scores. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining LoRA with SDXL for advanced image restoration tasks, highlighting the potential of our approach in generating high-fidelity restored images.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, restoration over gaming content is not well studied by the general public. The discrepancy is mainly caused by the lack of ground-truth gaming training data that match the test cases. Due to the unique characteristics of gaming content, the common approach of generating pseudo training data by degrading the original HR images results in inferior restoration performance. In this work, we develop GameIR, a large-scale high-quality computer-synthesized ground-truth dataset to fill in the blanks, targeting at two different applications. The first is super-resolution with deferred rendering, to support the gaming solution of rendering and transferring LR images only and restoring HR images on the client side. We provide 19200 LR-HR paired ground-truth frames coming from 640 videos rendered at 720p and 1440p for this task. The second is novel view synthesis (NVS), to support the multiview gaming solution of rendering and transferring part of the multiview frames and generating the remaining frames on the client side. This task has 57,600 HR frames from 960 videos of 160 scenes with 6 camera views. In addition to the RGB frames, the GBuffers during the deferred rendering stage are also provided, which can be used to help restoration. Furthermore, we evaluate several SOTA super-resolution algorithms and NeRF-based NVS algorithms over our dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our ground-truth GameIR data in improving restoration performance for gaming content. Also, we test the method of incorporating the GBuffers as additional input information for helping super-resolution and NVS. We release our dataset and models to the general public to facilitate research on restoration methods over gaming content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Control for Diffusion Bridge in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16303v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration refers to the process of restoring a damaged low-quality image back to its corresponding high-quality image. Typically, we use convolutional neural networks to directly learn the mapping from low-quality images to high-quality images achieving image restoration. Recently, a special type of diffusion bridge model has achieved more advanced results in image restoration. It can transform the direct mapping from low-quality to high-quality images into a diffusion process, restoring low-quality images through a reverse process. However, the current diffusion bridge restoration models do not emphasize the idea of conditional control, which may affect performance. This paper introduces the ECDB model enhancing the control of the diffusion bridge with low-quality images as conditions. Moreover, in response to the characteristic of diffusion models having low denoising level at larger values of \(\bm t \), we also propose a Conditional Fusion Schedule, which more effectively handles the conditional feature information of various modules. Experimental results prove that the ECDB model has achieved state-of-the-art results in many image restoration tasks, including deraining, inpainting and super-resolution.

| **[Perceive-IR: Learning to Perceive Degradation Better for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15994v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limitations of task-specific and general image restoration methods for specific degradation have prompted the development of all-in-one image restoration techniques. However, the diversity of patterns among multiple degradation, along with the significant uncertainties in mapping between degraded images of different severities and their corresponding undistorted versions, pose significant challenges to the all-in-one restoration tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Perceive-IR, an all-in-one image restorer designed to achieve fine-grained quality control that enables restored images to more closely resemble their undistorted counterparts, regardless of the type or severity of degradation. Specifically, Perceive-IR contains two stages: (1) prompt learning stage and (2) restoration stage. In the prompt learning stage, we leverage prompt learning to acquire a fine-grained quality perceiver capable of distinguishing three-tier quality levels by constraining the prompt-image similarity in the CLIP perception space. Subsequently, this quality perceiver and difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss are integrated as a quality-aware learning strategy to realize fine-grained quality control in restoration stage. For the restoration stage, a semantic guidance module (SGM) and compact feature extraction (CFE) are proposed to further promote the restoration process by utilizing the robust semantic information from the pre-trained large scale vision models and distinguishing degradation-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Perceive-IR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all-in-one image restoration tasks and exhibit superior generalization ability when dealing with unseen tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different degradation types, thus forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a \textbf{H}ypernetworks-based \textbf{A}ll-in-One \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration method that dynamically generates parameters based on input images. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and all-in-one settings. Notably, our innovative model, Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to the prevalent All-in-One methodologies.

MCGF establishes a joint optimization between image restoration and geo-localization using denoising diffusion models. For image restoration, MCGF incorporates a shared encoder and a lightweight restoration module to help the backbone eliminate weather-specific information. For geo-localization, MCGF uses EVA-02 as a backbone for feature extraction, with cross-entropy loss for training and cosine distance for testing.

| **[A Preliminary Exploration Towards General Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15143v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the tremendous success of deep models in various individual image restoration tasks, there are at least two major technical challenges preventing these works from being applied to real-world usages: (1) the lack of generalization ability and (2) the complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing deep models, tailored for specific individual image restoration tasks, often fall short in effectively addressing these challenges. In this paper, we present a new problem called general image restoration (GIR) which aims to address these challenges within a unified model. GIR covers most individual image restoration tasks (\eg, image denoising, deblurring, deraining and super-resolution) and their combinations for general purposes. This paper proceeds to delineate the essential aspects of GIR, including problem definition and the overarching significance of generalization performance. Moreover, the establishment of new datasets and a thorough evaluation framework for GIR models is discussed. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing approaches for tackling the GIR challenge, illuminating their strengths and pragmatic challenges. By analyzing these approaches, we not only underscore the effectiveness of GIR but also highlight the difficulties in its practical implementation. At last, we also try to understand and interpret these models' behaviors to inspire the future direction. Our work can open up new valuable research directions and contribute to the research of general vision.</p></details> |  |

However, conditioning on noisy or Out-of-Distribution (OoD) images poses significant challenges, particularly in balancing fidelity to the input and realism of the output. We introduce Confident Ordinary Differential Editing (CODE), a novel approach for image synthesis that effectively handles OoD guidance images. Utilizing a diffusion model as a generative prior, CODE enhances images through score-based updates along the probability-flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. This method requires no task-specific training, no handcrafted modules, and no assumptions regarding the corruptions affecting the conditioning image. Our method is compatible with any diffusion model. Positioned at the intersection of conditional image generation and blind image restoration, CODE operates in a fully blind manner, relying solely on a pre-trained generative model. Our method introduces an alternative approach to blind restoration: instead of targeting a specific ground truth image based on assumptions about the underlying corruption, CODE aims to increase the likelihood of the input image while maintaining fidelity. This results in the most probable in-distribution image around the input. Our contributions are twofold. First, CODE introduces a novel editing method based on ODE, providing enhanced control, realism, and fidelity compared to its SDE-based counterpart. Second, we introduce a confidence interval-based clipping method, which improves CODE's effectiveness by allowing it to disregard certain pixels or information, thus enhancing the restoration process in a blind manner. Experimental results demonstrate CODE's effectiveness over existing methods, particularly in scenarios involving severe degradation or OoD inputs.</p></details> |  |

Recently, these algorithms have been paired with deep learning strategies, to further improve the estimate quality. In particular, proximal neural networks (PNNs) have been introduced, obtained by unrolling a proximal algorithm as for finding a MAP estimate, but over a fixed number of iterations, with learned linear operators and parameters. As PNNs are based on optimization theory, they are very flexible, and can be adapted to any image restoration task, as soon as a proximal algorithm can solve it. They further have much lighter architectures than traditional networks. In this article we propose a unified framework to build PNNs for the Gaussian denoising task, based on both the dual-FB and the primal-dual Chambolle-Pock algorithms. We further show that accelerated inertial versions of these algorithms enable skip connections in the associated NN layers. We propose different learning strategies for our PNN framework, and investigate their robustness (Lipschitz property) and denoising efficiency. Finally, we assess the robustness of our PNNs when plugged in a forward-backward algorithm for an image deblurring problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[OAPT: Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for Double JPEG Artifacts Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11480v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable performance in single JPEG artifacts removal task. However, existing methods tend to degrade on double JPEG images, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for double JPEG artifacts removal, termed as OAPT. We conduct an analysis of double JPEG compression that results in up to four patterns within each 8x8 block and design our model to cluster the similar patterns to remedy the difficulty of restoration. Our OAPT consists of two components: compression offset predictor and image reconstructor. Specifically, the predictor estimates pixel offsets between the first and second compression, which are then utilized to divide different patterns. The reconstructor is mainly based on several Hybrid Partition Attention Blocks (HPAB), combining vanilla window-based self-attention and sparse attention for clustered pattern features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OAPT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 0.16dB in double JPEG image restoration task. Moreover, without increasing any computation cost, the pattern clustering module in HPAB can serve as a plugin to enhance other transformer-based image restoration methods.

However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration. Moreover, BIR-D can also restore images that undergo multiple and complicated degradations, demonstrating the practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Diffusion-based inverse problem solvers generate reconstructions of exceptional visual quality from heavily corrupted measurements. However, in what is widely known as the perception-distortion trade-off, the price of perceptually appealing reconstructions is often paid in declined distortion metrics, such as PSNR. Distortion metrics measure faithfulness to the observation, a crucial requirement in inverse problems. In this work, we propose a novel framework for inverse problem solving, namely we assume that the observation comes from a stochastic degradation process that gradually degrades and noises the original clean image. We learn to reverse the degradation process in order to recover the clean image. Our technique maintains consistency with the original measurement throughout the reverse process, and allows for great flexibility in trading off perceptual quality for improved distortion metrics and sampling speedup via early-stopping. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on different high-resolution datasets and inverse problems, achieving great improvements over other state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with respect to both perceptual and distortion metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 15 figures, published at the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning, Vienna, Austria, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Representation Learning for Image Restoration with State-Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10145v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration endeavors to reconstruct a high-quality, detail-rich image from a degraded counterpart, which is a pivotal process in photography and various computer vision systems. In real-world scenarios, different types of degradation can cause the loss of image details at various scales and degrade image contrast. Existing methods predominantly rely on CNN and Transformer to capture multi-scale representations. However, these methods are often limited by the high computational complexity of Transformers and the constrained receptive field of CNN, which hinder them from achieving superior performance and efficiency in image restoration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Scale State-Space Model-based (MS-Mamba) for efficient image restoration that enhances the capacity for multi-scale representation learning through our proposed global and regional SSM modules. Additionally, an Adaptive Gradient Block (AGB) and a Residual Fourier Block (RFB) are proposed to improve the network's detail extraction capabilities by capturing gradients in various directions and facilitating learning details in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on nine public benchmarks across four classic image restoration tasks, image deraining, dehazing, denoising, and low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational complexity. The source code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Multi-resolution and Multi-scale Attention for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09912v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater imagery is often compromised by factors such as color distortion and low contrast, posing challenges for high-level vision tasks. Recent underwater image restoration (UIR) methods either analyze the input image at full resolution, resulting in spatial richness but contextual weakness, or progressively from high to low resolution, yielding reliable semantic information but reduced spatial accuracy. Here, we propose a lightweight multi-stage network called Lit-Net that focuses on multi-resolution and multi-scale image analysis for restoring underwater images while retaining original resolution during the first stage, refining features in the second, and focusing on reconstruction in the final stage. Our novel encoder block utilizes parallel $1\times1$ convolution layers to capture local information and speed up operations. Further, we incorporate a modified weighted color channel-specific $l_1$ loss ($cl_1$) function to recover color and detail information. Extensive experimentations on publicly available datasets suggest our model's superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvement in qualitative and quantitative measures, such as $29.477$ dB PSNR ($1.92\%$ improvement) and $0.851$ SSIM ($2.87\%$ improvement) on the EUVP dataset. The contributions of Lit-Net offer a more robust approach to underwater image enhancement and super-resolution, which is of considerable importance for underwater autonomous vehicles and surveillance.

| **[Re-boosting Self-Collaboration Parallel Prompt GAN for Unsupervised Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09241v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised restoration approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a promising solution without requiring paired datasets. Yet, these GAN-based approaches struggle to surpass the performance of conventional unsupervised GAN-based frameworks without significantly modifying model structures or increasing the computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for existing restoration models. This strategy utilizes information from the previous stage as feedback to guide subsequent stages, achieving significant performance improvement without increasing the framework's inference complexity. The SC strategy comprises a prompt learning (PL) module and a restorer ($Res$). It iteratively replaces the previous less powerful fixed restorer $\overline{Res}$ in the PL module with a more powerful $Res$. The enhanced PL module generates better pseudo-degraded/clean image pairs, leading to a more powerful $Res$ for the next iteration. Our SC can significantly improve the $Res$'s performance by over 1.5 dB without adding extra parameters or computational complexity during inference. Meanwhile, existing self-ensemble (SE) and our SC strategies enhance the performance of pre-trained restorers from different perspectives. As SE increases computational complexity during inference, we propose a re-boosting module to the SC (Reb-SC) to improve the SC strategy further by incorporating SE into SC without increasing inference time. This approach further enhances the restorer's performance by approximately 0.3 dB. Extensive experimental results on restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art unsupervised restoration methods.

| **[Multi-task Image Restoration Guided By Robust DINO Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01677v3)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task image restoration has gained significant interest due to its inherent versatility and efficiency compared to its single-task counterpart. However, performance decline is observed with an increase in the number of tasks, primarily attributed to the restoration model's challenge in handling different tasks with distinct natures at the same time. Thus, a perspective emerged aiming to explore the degradation-insensitive semantic commonalities among different degradation tasks. In this paper, we observe that the features of DINOv2 can effectively model semantic information and are independent of degradation factors. Motivated by this observation, we propose \mbox{\textbf{DINO-IR}}, a multi-task image restoration approach leveraging robust features extracted from DINOv2 to solve multi-task image restoration simultaneously. We first propose a pixel-semantic fusion (PSF) module to dynamically fuse DINOV2's shallow features containing pixel-level information and deep features containing degradation-independent semantic information. To guide the restoration model with the features of DINOv2, we develop a DINO-Restore adaption and fusion module to adjust the channel of fused features from PSF and then integrate them with the features from the restoration model. By formulating these modules into a unified deep model, we propose a DINO perception contrastive loss to constrain the model training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DINO-IR performs favorably against existing multi-task image restoration approaches in various tasks by a large margin. The source codes and trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Variational Translator for Bridging Image Restoration and High-Level Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08149v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research tries to extend image restoration capabilities from human perception to machine perception, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks in degraded environments. These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review Learning: Advancing All-in-One Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration Training Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06709v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-in-one image restoration tasks are becoming increasingly important, especially for ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. Existing all-in-one UHD image restoration methods usually boost the model's performance by introducing prompt or customized dynamized networks for different degradation types. For the inference stage, it might be friendly, but in the training stage, since the model encounters multiple degraded images of different quality in an epoch, these cluttered learning objectives might be information pollution for the model. To address this problem, we propose a new training paradigm for general image restoration models, which we name \textbf{Review Learning}, which enables image restoration models to be capable enough to handle multiple types of degradation without prior knowledge and prompts. This approach begins with sequential training of an image restoration model on several degraded datasets, combined with a review mechanism that enhances the image restoration model's memory for several previous classes of degraded datasets. In addition, we design a lightweight all-purpose image restoration network that can efficiently reason about degraded images with 4K ($3840 \times 2160$) resolution on a single consumer-grade GPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet based inpainting detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06429v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement in image editing tools, manipulating digital images has become alarmingly easy. Inpainting, which is used to remove objects or fill in parts of an image, serves as a powerful tool for both image restoration and forgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting image inpainting forgeries by combining DT-CWT with Hierarchical Feature segmentation and with noise inconsistency analysis. The DT-CWT offers several advantages for this task, including inherent shift-invariance, which makes it robust to minor manipulations during the inpainting process, and directional selectivity, which helps capture subtle artifacts introduced by inpainting in specific frequency bands and orientations. By first applying color image segmentation and then analyzing for each segment, noise inconsistency obtained via DT-CW we can identify patterns indicative of inpainting forgeries. The proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark dataset created for this purpose and is compared with existing forgery detection techniques. Our approach demonstrates superior results compared with SOTA in detecting inpainted images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Optimal Transport: A Practical Algorithm for Photo-realistic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02342v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an image restoration algorithm that can control the perceptual quality and/or the mean square error (MSE) of any pre-trained model, trading one over the other at test time. Our algorithm is few-shot: Given about a dozen images restored by the model, it can significantly improve the perceptual quality and/or the MSE of the model for newly restored images without further training. Our approach is motivated by a recent theoretical result that links between the minimum MSE (MMSE) predictor and the predictor that minimizes the MSE under a perfect perceptual quality constraint. Specifically, it has been shown that the latter can be obtained by optimally transporting the output of the former, such that its distribution matches the source data. Thus, to improve the perceptual quality of a predictor that was originally trained to minimize MSE, we approximate the optimal transport by a linear transformation in the latent space of a variational auto-encoder, which we compute in closed-form using empirical means and covariances. Going beyond the theory, we find that applying the same procedure on models that were initially trained to achieve high perceptual quality, typically improves their perceptual quality even further. And by interpolating the results with the original output of the model, we can improve their MSE on the expense of perceptual quality. We illustrate our method on a variety of degradations applied to general content images of arbitrary dimensions.</p></details> |  |

It is demonstrated that our algorithms converge to the unique least-norm solution of the matrix equation when it is consistent and their convergence rate is faster than that of the randomized block Kaczmarz method (ME-RBK). Moreover, the block Kaczmarz method (ME-BK) for solving the matrix equation $AXB=C$ is investigated and it is found that the ME-BK method converges to the solution $A^{+}CB^{+}+X^{0}-A^{+}AX^{0}BB^{+}$ when it is consistent. The numerical tests verify the theoretical results and the methods presented in this paper are applied to the color image restoration problem to obtain satisfactory restored images.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a Physical Prior Guided Cooperative Learning (P2GCL) framework to jointly enhance atmospheric turbulence strength estimation and infrared image restoration. P2GCL involves a cyclic collaboration between two models, i.e., a TMNet measures turbulence strength and outputs the refractive index structure constant (Cn2) as a physical prior, a TRNet conducts infrared image sequence restoration based on Cn2 and feeds the restored images back to the TMNet to boost the measurement accuracy. A novel Cn2-guided frequency loss function and a physical constraint loss are introduced to align the training process with physical theories. Experiments demonstrate P2GCL achieves the best performance for both turbulence strength estimation (improving Cn2 MAE by 0.0156, enhancing R2 by 0.1065) and image restoration (enhancing PSNR by 0.2775 dB), validating the significant impact of physical prior guided cooperative learning.</p></details> | 21 |

However, we find that previous approaches rely on the digital representation from single color model with a specific mapping function, a.k.a., color space, during the colorization pipeline. In this paper, we first investigate the modeling of different color spaces, and find each of them exhibiting distinctive characteristics with unique distribution of colors. The complementarity among multiple color spaces leads to benefits for the image colorization task. We present MultiColor, a new learning-based approach to automatically colorize grayscale images that combines clues from multiple color spaces. Specifically, we employ a set of dedicated colorization modules for individual color space. Within each module, a transformer decoder is first employed to refine color query embeddings and then a color mapper produces color channel prediction using the embeddings and semantic features. With these predicted color channels representing various color spaces, a complementary network is designed to exploit the complementarity and generate pleasing and reasonable colorized images. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Existing diffusion-based image restoration algorithms exploit pre-trained diffusion models to leverage data priors, yet they still preserve elements inherited from the unconditional generation paradigm. These strategies initiate the denoising process with pure white noise and incorporate random noise at each generative step, leading to over-smoothed results. In this paper, we present a refined paradigm for diffusion-based image restoration. Specifically, we opt for a sample consistent with the measurement identity at each generative step, exploiting the sampling selection as an avenue for output stability and enhancement. The number of candidate samples used for selection is adaptively determined based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the timestep. Additionally, we start the restoration process with an initialization combined with the measurement signal, providing supplementary information to better align the generative process. Extensive experimental results and analyses validate that our proposed method significantly enhances image restoration performance while consuming negligible additional computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM Multimedia 2024 Oral</p></details> |

Historically, most methodologies have predominantly utilized spatial domain recovery, offering limited consideration to the potentialities of the frequency domain. Additionally, there has been a lack of a unified perspective towards low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, complicating and impeding the optimization of image processing. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology that leverages the frequency domain to improve and unify the handling of exposure correction tasks. Our method introduces Holistic Frequency Attention and Dynamic Frequency Feed-Forward Network, which replace conventional correlation computation in the spatial-domain. They form a foundational building block that facilitates a U-shaped Holistic Dynamic Frequency Transformer as a filter to extract global information and dynamically select important frequency bands for image restoration. Complementing this, we employ a Laplacian pyramid to decompose images into distinct frequency bands, followed by multiple restorers, each tuned to recover specific frequency-band information. The pyramid fusion allows a more detailed and nuanced image restoration process. Ultimately, our structure unifies the three tasks of low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, enabling comprehensive treatment of all classical exposure errors. Benchmarking on mainstream datasets for these tasks, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, paving the way for more sophisticated and unified solutions in exposure correction.</p></details> |  |

In low-level computer vision, however, there have been limited investigations on pre-trained models and even efficient fine-tuning strategy has not yet been explored despite its importance and benefit in various real-world tasks such as alleviating memory inflation issue when integrating new tasks on AI edge devices. Here, we propose a novel efficient parameter tuning approach dubbed contribution-based low-rank adaptation (CoLoRA) for multiple image restorations along with effective pre-training method with random order degradations (PROD). Unlike prior arts that tune all network parameters, our CoLoRA effectively fine-tunes small amount of parameters by leveraging LoRA (low-rank adaptation) for each new vision task with our contribution-based method to adaptively determine layer by layer capacity for that task to yield comparable performance to full tuning. Furthermore, our PROD strategy allows to extend the capability of pre-trained models with improved performance as well as robustness to bridge synthetic pre-training and real-world fine-tuning. Our CoLoRA with PROD has demonstrated its superior performance in various image restoration tasks across diverse degradation types on both synthetic and real-world datasets for known and novel tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 15 figures, for homepage see this url : https://janeyeon.github.io/colora/</p></details> |

This is worsened by lack of ground truth data of clean scenes without water. Diffusion priors have emerged as strong image restoration priors. However, they are often trained with a dataset of the desired restored output, which is not available in our case. We also observe that using only color data is insufficient, and therefore augment the prior with a depth channel. We train an unconditional diffusion model prior on the joint space of color and depth, using standard RGBD datasets of natural outdoor scenes in air. Using this prior together with a novel guidance method based on the underwater image formation model, we generate posterior samples of clean images, removing the water effects. Even though our prior did not see any underwater images during training, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image restoration on very challenging scenes.

Currently, little existing literature offers a solution to this problem. In response, we propose a prior embedding-driven architecture for long distance blind iris recognition. We first proposed a blind iris image restoration network called Iris-PPRGAN. To effectively restore the texture of the blind iris, Iris-PPRGAN includes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used as a Prior Decoder, and a DNN used as the encoder. To extract iris features more efficiently, we then proposed a robust iris classifier by modifying the bottleneck module of InsightFace, which called Insight-Iris. A low-quality blind iris image is first restored by Iris-PPRGAN, then the restored iris image undergoes recognition via Insight-Iris. Experimental results on the public CASIA-Iris-distance dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly superior results to state-of-the-art blind iris restoration methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, Specifically, the recognition rate for long-distance blind iris images reaches 90% after processing with our methods, representing an improvement of approximately ten percentage points compared to images without restoration.</p></details> |  |

The recent advent of RWKV in the NLP field has attracted much attention as it can process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Restore-RWKV achieves superior performance across various medical image restoration tasks, including MRI image super-resolution, CT image denoising, PET image synthesis, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance for various image processing tasks in terms of single-task conditions. However, they require to train separate models for different degradations and levels, which limits the generalization abilities of these models and restricts their applications in real-world. In this paper, we propose a text-induced unified image processor for low-level vision tasks, termed UniProcessor, which can effectively process various degradation types and levels, and support multimodal control. Specifically, our UniProcessor encodes degradation-specific information with the subject prompt and process degradations with the manipulation prompt. These context control features are injected into the UniProcessor backbone via cross-attention to control the processing procedure. For automatic subject-prompt generation, we further build a vision-language model for general-purpose low-level degradation perception via instruction tuning techniques. Our UniProcessor covers 30 degradation types, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our UniProcessor can well process these degradations without additional training or tuning and outperforms other competing methods. Moreover, with the help of degradation-aware context control, our UniProcessor first shows the ability to individually handle a single distortion in an image with multiple degradations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation and develop empirically effective algorithms for solving noiseless and noisy image inpainting tasks. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments across diverse mask settings.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Multi-Expert Adaptive Selection: Task-Balancing for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19139v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of a single image restoration framework to achieve multi-task image restoration has garnered significant attention from researchers. However, several practical challenges remain, including meeting the specific and simultaneous demands of different tasks, balancing relationships between tasks, and effectively utilizing task correlations in model design. To address these challenges, this paper explores a multi-expert adaptive selection mechanism. We begin by designing a feature representation method that accounts for both the pixel channel level and the global level, encompassing low-frequency and high-frequency components of the image. Based on this method, we construct a multi-expert selection and ensemble scheme. This scheme adaptively selects the most suitable expert from the expert library according to the content of the input image and the prompts of the current task. It not only meets the individualized needs of different tasks but also achieves balance and optimization across tasks. By sharing experts, our design promotes interconnections between different tasks, thereby enhancing overall performance and resource utilization. Additionally, the multi-expert mechanism effectively eliminates irrelevant experts, reducing interference from them and further improving the effectiveness and accuracy of image restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is both effective and superior to existing approaches, highlighting its potential for practical applications in multi-task image restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dilated Strip Attention Network for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18613v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a long-standing task that seeks to recover the latent sharp image from its deteriorated counterpart. Due to the robust capacity of self-attention to capture long-range dependencies, transformer-based methods or some attention-based convolutional neural networks have demonstrated promising results on many image restoration tasks in recent years. However, existing attention modules encounters limited receptive fields or abundant parameters. In order to integrate contextual information more effectively and efficiently, in this paper, we propose a dilated strip attention network (DSAN) for image restoration. Specifically, to gather more contextual information for each pixel from its neighboring pixels in the same row or column, a dilated strip attention (DSA) mechanism is elaborately proposed. By employing the DSA operation horizontally and vertically, each location can harvest the contextual information from a much wider region. In addition, we utilize multi-scale receptive fields across different feature groups in DSA to improve representation learning. Extensive experiments show that our DSAN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on several image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RestoreAgent: Autonomous Image Restoration Agent via Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18035v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural images captured by mobile devices often suffer from multiple types of degradation, such as noise, blur, and low light. Traditional image restoration methods require manual selection of specific tasks, algorithms, and execution sequences, which is time-consuming and may yield suboptimal results. All-in-one models, though capable of handling multiple tasks, typically support only a limited range and often produce overly smooth, low-fidelity outcomes due to their broad data distribution fitting. To address these challenges, we first define a new pipeline for restoring images with multiple degradations, and then introduce RestoreAgent, an intelligent image restoration system leveraging multimodal large language models. RestoreAgent autonomously assesses the type and extent of degradation in input images and performs restoration through (1) determining the appropriate restoration tasks, (2) optimizing the task sequence, (3) selecting the most suitable models, and (4) executing the restoration. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of RestoreAgent in handling complex degradation, surpassing human experts. Furthermore, the system modular design facilitates the fast integration of new tasks and models, enhancing its flexibility and scalability for various applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restoring Images in Adverse Weather Conditions via Histogram Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10172v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based image restoration methods in adverse weather have achieved significant progress. Most of them use self-attention along the channel dimension or within spatially fixed-range blocks to reduce computational load. However, such a compromise results in limitations in capturing long-range spatial features. Inspired by the observation that the weather-induced degradation factors mainly cause similar occlusion and brightness, in this work, we propose an efficient Histogram Transformer (Histoformer) for restoring images affected by adverse weather. It is powered by a mechanism dubbed histogram self-attention, which sorts and segments spatial features into intensity-based bins. Self-attention is then applied across bins or within each bin to selectively focus on spatial features of dynamic range and process similar degraded pixels of the long range together. To boost histogram self-attention, we present a dynamic-range convolution enabling conventional convolution to conduct operation over similar pixels rather than neighbor pixels. We also observe that the common pixel-wise losses neglect linear association and correlation between output and ground-truth. Thus, we propose to leverage the Pearson correlation coefficient as a loss function to enforce the recovered pixels following the identical order as ground-truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our proposed method. We have released the codes in Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 10MB</p></details> |
| **[CLII: Visual-Text Inpainting via Cross-Modal Predictive Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16204v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image inpainting aims to fill missing pixels in damaged images and has achieved significant progress with cut-edging learning techniques. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art inpainting methods are mainly designed for nature images and cannot correctly recover text within scene text images, and training existing models on the scene text images cannot fix the issues. In this work, we identify the visual-text inpainting task to achieve high-quality scene text image restoration and text completion: Given a scene text image with unknown missing regions and the corresponding text with unknown missing characters, we aim to complete the missing information in both images and text by leveraging their complementary information. Intuitively, the input text, even if damaged, contains language priors of the contents within the images and can guide the image inpainting. Meanwhile, the scene text image includes the appearance cues of the characters that could benefit text recovery. To this end, we design the cross-modal predictive interaction (CLII) model containing two branches, i.e., ImgBranch and TxtBranch, for scene text inpainting and text completion, respectively while leveraging their complementary effectively. Moreover, we propose to embed our model into the SOTA scene text spotting method and significantly enhance its robustness against missing pixels, which demonstrates the practicality of the newly developed task. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we construct three real datasets based on existing text-related datasets, containing 1838 images and covering three scenarios with curved, incidental, and styled texts, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms baselines significantly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Prior-Based Amortized Variational Inference for Noisy Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16125v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on inverse problems have proposed posterior samplers that leverage the pre-trained diffusion models as powerful priors. These attempts have paved the way for using diffusion models in a wide range of inverse problems. However, the existing methods entail computationally demanding iterative sampling procedures and optimize a separate solution for each measurement, which leads to limited scalability and lack of generalization capability across unseen samples. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion prior-based Amortized Variational Inference (DAVI) that solves inverse problems with a diffusion prior from an amortized variational inference perspective. Specifically, instead of separate measurement-wise optimization, our amortized inference learns a function that directly maps measurements to the implicit posterior distributions of corresponding clean data, enabling a single-step posterior sampling even for unseen measurements. Extensive experiments on image restoration tasks, e.g., Gaussian deblur, 4$\times$ super-resolution, and box inpainting with two benchmark datasets, demonstrate our approach's superior performance over strong baselines.

| **[HPPP: Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point Algorithms and Applications to Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13120v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preconditioned Proximal Point (PPP) algorithms provide a unified framework for splitting methods in image restoration. Recent advancements with RED (Regularization by Denoising) and PnP (Plug-and-Play) priors have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this domain, emphasizing the need for a meaningful particular solution. However, degenerate PPP algorithms typically exhibit weak convergence in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, leading to uncertain solutions. To address this issue, we propose the Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence properties of Halpern iteration to achieve a particular solution. Based on the implicit regularization defined by gradient RED, we further introduce the Gradient REgularization by Denoising via HPPP called GraRED-HP3 algorithm. The HPPP algorithm is shown to have the regularity converging to a particular solution by a toy example. Additionally, experiments in image deblurring and inpainting validate the effectiveness of GraRED-HP3, showing it surpasses classical methods such as Chambolle-Pock (CP), PPP, RED, and RED-PRO.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffLoss: unleashing diffusion model as constraint for training image restoration network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19030v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to enhance low quality images, producing high quality images that exhibit natural visual characteristics and fine semantic attributes. Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful technique for image generation, and it has been explicitly employed as a backbone in image restoration tasks, yielding excellent results. However, it suffers from the drawbacks of slow inference speed and large model parameters due to its intrinsic characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective that implicitly leverages the diffusion model to assist the training of image restoration network, called DiffLoss, which drives the restoration results to be optimized for naturalness and semantic-aware visual effect. To achieve this, we utilize the mode coverage capability of the diffusion model to approximate the distribution of natural images and explore its ability to capture image semantic attributes. On the one hand, we extract intermediate noise to leverage its modeling capability of the distribution of natural images, which serves as a naturalness-oriented optimization space. On the other hand, we utilize the bottleneck features of diffusion model to harness its semantic attributes serving as a constraint on semantic level. By combining these two designs, the overall loss function is able to improve the perceptual quality of image restoration, resulting in visually pleasing and semantically enhanced outcomes. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on various common image restoration tasks and benchmarks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the visual quality and semantic perception of the restoration network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning CT Image Restoration using System Blur and Noise Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14983v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The restoration of images affected by blur and noise has been widely studied and has broad potential for applications including in medical imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT). Although the blur and noise in CT images can be attributed to a variety of system factors, these image properties can often be modeled and predicted accurately and used in classical restoration approaches for deconvolution and denoising. In classical approaches, simultaneous deconvolution and denoising can be challenging and often represent competing goals. Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated the potential to enhance image quality beyond classic limits; however, most deep learning models attempt a blind restoration problem and base their restoration on image inputs alone without direct knowledge of the image noise and blur properties. In this work, we present a method that leverages both degraded image inputs and a characterization of the system blur and noise to combine modeling and deep learning approaches. Different methods to integrate these auxiliary inputs are presented. Namely, an input-variant and a weight-variant approach wherein the auxiliary inputs are incorporated as a parameter vector before and after the convolutional block, respectively, allowing easy integration into any CNN architecture. The proposed model shows superior performance compared to baseline models lacking auxiliary inputs. Evaluations are based on the average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), selected examples of good and poor performance for varying approaches, and an input space analysis to assess the effect of different noise and blur on performance. Results demonstrate the efficacy of providing a deep learning model with auxiliary inputs, representing system blur and noise characteristics, to enhance the performance of the model in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual High-Order Total Variation Model for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14868v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images are typically characterized by color cast, haze, blurring, and uneven illumination due to the selective absorption and scattering when light propagates through the water, which limits their practical applications. Underwater image enhancement and restoration (UIER) is one crucial mode to improve the visual quality of underwater images. However, most existing UIER methods concentrate on enhancing contrast and dehazing, rarely pay attention to the local illumination differences within the image caused by illumination variations, thus introducing some undesirable artifacts and unnatural color. To address this issue, an effective variational framework is proposed based on an extended underwater image formation model (UIFM). Technically, dual high-order regularizations are successfully integrated into the variational model to acquire smoothed local ambient illuminance and structure-revealed reflectance in a unified manner. In our proposed framework, the weight factors-based color compensation is combined with the color balance to compensate for the attenuated color channels and remove the color cast. In particular, the local ambient illuminance with strong robustness is acquired by performing the local patch brightest pixel estimation and an improved gamma correction. Additionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm relying on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to accelerate the solution of the proposed variational model. Considerable experiments on three real-world underwater image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with regard to visual quality and quantitative assessments. Moreover, the proposed method can also be extended to outdoor image dehazing, low-light image enhancement, and some high-level vision tasks.

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

However, existing models often require specific learning modules tailored for each degradation, resulting in complex architectures and high computation costs. Different from previous work, in this paper, we propose a unified manner to achieve joint embedding by leveraging the inherent similarities across various degradations for efficient and comprehensive restoration. Specifically, we first dig into the sub-latent space of each input to analyze the key components and reweight their contributions in a gated manner. The intrinsic awareness is further integrated with contextualized attention in an X-shaped scheme, maximizing local-global intertwining. Extensive comparison on benchmarking all-in-one restoration setting validates our efficiency and effectiveness, i.e., our network sets new SOTA records while reducing model complexity by approximately -82% in trainable parameters and -85\% in FLOPs.

Specifically, VAEs often suffer from blurry generated samples due to the lack of a tailored training on the samples generated in the generative direction. On the other hand, EBMs can generate high-quality samples but require expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. To address these issues, we introduce a conditional EBM for calibrating the generative direction of VAE during training, without requiring it for the generation at test time. In particular, we train EC-VAE upon both the input data and the calibrated samples with adaptive weight to enhance efficacy while avoiding MCMC sampling at test time. Furthermore, we extend the calibration idea of EC-VAE to variational learning and normalizing flows, and apply EC-VAE to an additional application of zero-shot image restoration via neural transport prior and range-null theory. We evaluate the proposed method with two applications, including image generation and zero-shot image restoration, and the experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance over single-step non-adversarial generation.

Despite the notable achievement, existing methods predominantly focus on handling specific degradation types and thus require specialized models, impeding real-world applications in dynamic degradation scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Large Model Driven Image Restoration framework (LMDIR), a novel multiple-in-one image restoration paradigm that leverages the generic priors from large multi-modal language models (MMLMs) and the pretrained diffusion models. In detail, LMDIR integrates three key prior knowledges: 1) global degradation knowledge from MMLMs, 2) scene-aware contextual descriptions generated by MMLMs, and 3) fine-grained high-quality reference images synthesized by diffusion models guided by MMLM descriptions. Standing on above priors, our architecture comprises a query-based prompt encoder, degradation-aware transformer block injecting global degradation knowledge, content-aware transformer block incorporating scene description, and reference-based transformer block incorporating fine-grained image priors. This design facilitates single-stage training paradigm to address various degradations while supporting both automatic and user-guided restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our designed method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on multiple evaluation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRIDS: Grouped Multiple-Degradation Restoration with Image Degradation Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12273v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional single-task image restoration methods excel in handling specific degradation types but struggle with multiple degradations. To address this limitation, we propose Grouped Restoration with Image Degradation Similarity (GRIDS), a novel approach that harmonizes the competing objectives inherent in multiple-degradation restoration. We first introduce a quantitative method for assessing relationships between image degradations using statistical modeling of deep degradation representations. This analysis facilitates the strategic grouping of similar tasks, enhancing both the efficiency and effectiveness of the restoration process. Based on the degradation similarity, GRIDS divides restoration tasks into one of the optimal groups, where tasks within the same group are highly correlated. For instance, GRIDS effectively groups 11 degradation types into 4 cohesive groups. Trained models within each group show significant improvements, with an average improvement of 0.09dB over single-task upper bound models and 2.24dB over the mix-training baseline model. GRIDS incorporates an adaptive model selection mechanism for inference, automatically selecting the appropriate grouped-training model based on the input degradation. This mechanism is particularly useful for real-world scenarios with unknown degradations as it does not rely on explicit degradation classification modules. Furthermore, our method can predict model generalization ability without the need for network inference, providing valuable insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

An intuitive manifestation is that networks which excel in certain tasks often fail to deliver satisfactory results in others. To illustrate this point, we select five representative networks and conduct a comparative study on five classic image restoration tasks. First, we provide a detailed explanation of the characteristics of different image restoration tasks and backbone networks. Following this, we present the benchmark results and analyze the reasons behind the performance disparity of different models across various tasks. Drawing from this comparative study, we propose that a general image restoration backbone network needs to meet the functional requirements of diverse tasks. Based on this principle, we design a new general image restoration backbone network, X-Restormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Restormer possesses good task generality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to ECCV2024 |

Recognizing the limitations of traditional physical model-based methods and the inefficiencies of current attention-based solutions, we propose a new dehazing network combining an innovative Haze-Aware Attention Module (HAAM) with a Multiscale Frequency Enhancement Module (MFEM). The HAAM is inspired by the atmospheric scattering model, thus skillfully integrating physical principles into high-dimensional features for targeted dehazing. It picks up on latent features during the image restoration process, which gives a significant boost to the metrics, while the MFEM efficiently enhances high-frequency details, thus sidestepping wavelet or Fourier transform complexities. It employs multiscale fields to extract and emphasize key frequency components with minimal parameter overhead. Integrated into a simple U-Net framework, our Haze-Aware Attention Network (HAA-Net) for single-image dehazing significantly outperforms existing attention-based and transformer models in efficiency and effectiveness. Tested across various public datasets, the HAA-Net sets new performance benchmarks. Our work not only advances the field of image dehazing but also offers insights into the design of attention mechanisms for broader applications in computer vision.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, it still remains an open research problem to adopt this language-vision paradigm for more fine-level image processing tasks, such as denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and compression artifact removal. In this paper, we develop SPIRE, a Semantic and restoration Prompt-driven Image Restoration framework that leverages natural language as a user-friendly interface to control the image restoration process. We consider the capacity of prompt information in two dimensions. First, we use content-related prompts to enhance the semantic alignment, effectively alleviating identity ambiguity in the restoration outcomes. Second, our approach is the first framework that supports fine-level instruction through language-based quantitative specification of the restoration strength, without the need for explicit task-specific design. In addition, we introduce a novel fusion mechanism that augments the existing ControlNet architecture by learning to rescale the generative prior, thereby achieving better restoration fidelity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior restoration performance of SPIRE compared to the state of the arts, alongside offering the flexibility of text-based control over the restoration effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024; Webpage: https://chenyangqiqi.github.io/tip</p></details> |

This intends to handle two pivotal challenges in the existing CIR methods: (i) lacking adaptability and universality for different image codecs, e.g., JPEG and WebP; (ii) poor texture generation capability, particularly at low bitrates. Specifically, our MoE-DiffIR develops the powerful mixture-of-experts (MoE) prompt module, where some basic prompts cooperate to excavate the task-customized diffusion priors from Stable Diffusion (SD) for each compression task. Moreover, the degradation-aware routing mechanism is proposed to enable the flexible assignment of basic prompts. To activate and reuse the cross-modality generation prior of SD, we design the visual-to-text adapter for MoE-DiffIR, which aims to adapt the embedding of low-quality images from the visual domain to the textual domain as the textual guidance for SD, enabling more consistent and reasonable texture generation. We also construct one comprehensive benchmark dataset for universal CIR, covering 21 types of degradations from 7 popular traditional and learned codecs.

Among them, the blind spot network based methods are the most typical type and have attracted the attentions of a large number of researchers. Although the introduction of blind spot operations can prevent identity mapping from noise to noise, it imposes stringent requirements on the receptive fields in the network design, thereby limiting overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a single mask scheme for self-supervised denoising training, which eliminates the need for blind spot operation and thereby removes constraints on the network structure design. Furthermore, to achieve denoising across entire image during inference, we propose a multi-mask scheme. Our method, featuring the asymmetric mask scheme in training and inference, achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing real noisy image datasets.

Common models involve several stages of data resampling, in which the resolution of feature maps is first reduced to aggregate information and then increased to generate a high-resolution output. Previous works have shown that resampling operations are subject to artifacts such as aliasing. During downsampling, aliases have been shown to compromise the prediction stability of image classifiers. During upsampling, they have been leveraged to detect generated content. Yet, the effect of aliases during upsampling has not yet been discussed w.r.t. the stability and robustness of pixel-wise predictions. While falling under the same term (aliasing), the challenges for correct upsampling in neural networks differ significantly from those during downsampling: when downsampling, some high frequencies can not be correctly represented and have to be removed to avoid aliases. However, when upsampling for pixel-wise predictions, we actually require the model to restore such high frequencies that can not be encoded in lower resolutions. The application of findings from signal processing is therefore a necessary but not a sufficient condition to achieve the desirable output. In contrast, we find that the availability of large spatial context during upsampling allows to provide stable, high-quality pixel-wise predictions, even when fully learning all filter weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Recently, the diffusion models have shown compelling performance in generating realistic details for image restoration tasks. However, the diffusion process has randomness, making it hard to control the contents of restored images. This issue becomes more serious when applying diffusion models to VSR tasks because temporal consistency is crucial to the perceptual quality of videos. In this paper, we propose an effective real-world VSR algorithm by leveraging the strength of pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure the content consistency among adjacent frames, we exploit the temporal dynamics in LR videos to guide the diffusion process by optimizing the latent sampling path with a motion-guided loss, ensuring that the generated HR video maintains a coherent and continuous visual flow. To further mitigate the discontinuity of generated details, we insert temporal module to the decoder and fine-tune it with an innovative sequence-oriented loss. The proposed motion-guided latent diffusion (MGLD) based VSR algorithm achieves significantly better perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Region Attention Transformer for Medical Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09268v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in medical image restoration, attributed to the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism in the spatial dimension. However, the majority of existing Transformers conduct attention within fixed and coarsely partitioned regions (\text{e.g.} the entire image or fixed patches), resulting in interference from irrelevant regions and fragmentation of continuous image content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Region Attention Transformer (RAT) that utilizes a region-based multi-head self-attention mechanism (R-MSA). The R-MSA dynamically partitions the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions using the robust Segment Anything Model (SAM) and then performs self-attention within these regions. This region partitioning is more flexible and interpretable, ensuring that only pixels from similar semantic regions complement each other, thereby eliminating interference from irrelevant regions. Moreover, we introduce a focal region loss to guide our model to adaptively focus on recovering high-difficulty regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RAT in various medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, and pathological image super-resolution.

However, most existing restoration approaches are limited in their applicability to specific weather conditions in training data and struggle to generalize to unseen weather types, including real-world weather conditions. To address this issue, we introduce MetaWeather, a universal approach that can handle diverse and novel weather conditions with a single unified model. Extending a powerful meta-learning framework, MetaWeather formulates the task of weather-degraded image restoration as a few-shot adaptation problem that predicts the degradation pattern of a query image, and learns to adapt to unseen weather conditions through a novel spatial-channel matching algorithm. Experimental results on the BID Task II.A, SPA-Data, and RealSnow datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can adapt to unseen weather conditions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-weather image restoration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

Many existing methods primarily focus on the spatial domain, neglecting the understanding of frequency variations and ignoring the impact of implicit noise in skip connections. In this paper, we introduce a multi-scale frequency selection network (MSFSNet) that seamlessly integrates spatial and frequency domain knowledge, selectively recovering richer and more accurate information. Specifically, we initially capture spatial features and input them into dynamic filter selection modules (DFS) at different scales to integrate frequency knowledge. DFS utilizes learnable filters to generate high and low-frequency information and employs a frequency cross-attention mechanism (FCAM) to determine the most information to recover. To learn a multi-scale and accurate set of hybrid features, we develop a skip feature fusion block (SFF) that leverages contextual features to discriminatively determine which information should be propagated in skip-connections. It is worth noting that our DFS and SFF are generic plug-in modules that can be directly employed in existing networks without any adjustments, leading to performance improvements. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that our MSFSNet achieves performance that is either superior or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.20106</p></details> |

Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking. In this paper, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from technical details to applications. We highlight the major advancements in deep learning-based single-image shadow removal methods, thoroughly review previous research across various categories, and provide insights into the historical progression of these developments. Additionally, we summarize performance comparisons both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond the technical aspects of shadow removal methods, we also explore potential future directions for this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>url: ...</summary><p>url: https://github.com/GuoLanqing/Awesome-Shadow-Removal</p></details> |

To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, based on our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method, known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants.

Nevertheless, this solution poses several key challenges: i) increasing the carrier frequency and bandwidth leads to greater channel frequency selectivity in time and frequency domains, and ii) the greater the number of antennas the greater the the pilot overhead for channel estimation and the more prohibitively complex it becomes to determine the optimal precoding matrix. This paper presents two deep-learning frameworks to solve these issues. Firstly, we propose a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that is based on image super-resolution and captures the correlations between the transmitting and receiving antennas and the frequency domains to combat frequency selectivity. Secondly, we devise a deep learning-based framework to combat the time selectivity of the channel that treats channel aging as a distortion that can be mitigated through deep learning-based image restoration techniques. Simulation results show that combining both frameworks leads to a significant improvement in performance compared to existing techniques with little increase in complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In particular, the pre-trained text-to-image stable diffusion models provide a potential solution to the challenging realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) and image stylization problems with their strong generative priors. However, the existing methods along this line often fail to keep faithful pixel-wise image structures. If extra skip connections between the encoder and the decoder of a VAE are used to reproduce details, additional training in image space will be required, limiting the application to tasks in latent space such as image stylization. In this work, we propose a pixel-aware stable diffusion (PASD) network to achieve robust Real-ISR and personalized image stylization. Specifically, a pixel-aware cross attention module is introduced to enable diffusion models perceiving image local structures in pixel-wise level, while a degradation removal module is used to extract degradation insensitive features to guide the diffusion process together with image high level information. An adjustable noise schedule is introduced to further improve the image restoration results. By simply replacing the base diffusion model with a stylized one, PASD can generate diverse stylized images without collecting pairwise training data, and by shifting the base model with an aesthetic one, PASD can bring old photos back to life. Extensive experiments in a variety of image enhancement and stylization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PASD approach.

All-In-One image restoration models can effectively restore images from various types and levels of degradation using degradation-specific information as prompts to guide the restoration model. In this work, we present the first approach that uses human-written instructions to guide the image restoration model. Given natural language prompts, our model can recover high-quality images from their degraded counterparts, considering multiple degradation types. Our method, InstructIR, achieves state-of-the-art results on several restoration tasks including image denoising, deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and (low-light) image enhancement.

In this research, we introduce a multi-scale generative model that enhances conditional image restoration through a novel exploitation of the Brownian Bridge process within wavelet domain. By initiating the Brownian Bridge diffusion process specifically at the lowest-frequency subband and applying generative adversarial networks at subsequent multi-scale high-frequency subbands in the wavelet domain, our method provides significant acceleration during training and sampling while sustaining a high image generation quality and diversity on par with SOTA diffusion models. Experimental results on various computational microscopy and imaging tasks confirm our method's robust performance and its considerable reduction in its sampling steps and time. This pioneering technique offers an efficient image restoration framework that harmonizes efficiency with quality, signifying a major stride in incorporating cutting-edge generative models into computational microscopy workflows.</p></details> |  |

Our solution is robust against black-box attacking and well-established generative adversarial network (GAN) based image restoration. We analyze the potential risk in previous work, where the proposed cosine similarity computation might directly leak the protected precomputed embedding stored on the server side. We propose a Function Secret Sharing (FSS) based face embedding comparison protocol without any intermediate result leakage. In addition, we show in experiments that the proposed protocol is more efficient compared to the Secret Sharing (SS) based protocol.</p></details> | Accepted at ICIP2024 |
| **[CosPGD: an efficient white-box adversarial attack for pixel-wise prediction tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02213v3)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While neural networks allow highly accurate predictions in many tasks, their lack of robustness towards even slight input perturbations often hampers their deployment. Adversarial attacks such as the seminal projected gradient descent (PGD) offer an effective means to evaluate a model's robustness and dedicated solutions have been proposed for attacks on semantic segmentation or optical flow estimation. While they attempt to increase the attack's efficiency, a further objective is to balance its effect, so that it acts on the entire image domain instead of isolated point-wise predictions. This often comes at the cost of optimization stability and thus efficiency. Here, we propose CosPGD, an attack that encourages more balanced errors over the entire image domain while increasing the attack's overall efficiency. To this end, CosPGD leverages a simple alignment score computed from any pixel-wise prediction and its target to scale the loss in a smooth and fully differentiable way. It leads to efficient evaluations of a model's robustness for semantic segmentation as well as regression models (such as optical flow, disparity estimation, or image restoration), and it allows it to outperform the previous SotA attack on semantic segmentation. We provide code for the CosPGD algorithm and example usage at https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/cospgd.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2024</p></details> |

| **[Diff-Restorer: Unleashing Visual Prompts for Diffusion-based Universal Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03636v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a classic low-level problem aimed at recovering high-quality images from low-quality images with various degradations such as blur, noise, rain, haze, etc. However, due to the inherent complexity and non-uniqueness of degradation in real-world images, it is challenging for a model trained for single tasks to handle real-world restoration problems effectively. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from over-smoothing and lack of realism in the restored results. To address these issues, we propose Diff-Restorer, a universal image restoration method based on the diffusion model, aiming to leverage the prior knowledge of Stable Diffusion to remove degradation while generating high perceptual quality restoration results. Specifically, we utilize the pre-trained visual language model to extract visual prompts from degraded images, including semantic and degradation embeddings. The semantic embeddings serve as content prompts to guide the diffusion model for generation. In contrast, the degradation embeddings modulate the Image-guided Control Module to generate spatial priors for controlling the spatial structure of the diffusion process, ensuring faithfulness to the original image. Additionally, we design a Degradation-aware Decoder to perform structural correction and convert the latent code to the pixel domain. We conducted comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis on restoration tasks with different degradations, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MRIR: Integrating Multimodal Insights for Diffusion-based Realistic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03635v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic image restoration is a crucial task in computer vision, and the use of diffusion-based models for image restoration has garnered significant attention due to their ability to produce realistic results. However, the quality of the generated images is still a significant challenge due to the severity of image degradation and the uncontrollability of the diffusion model. In this work, we delve into the potential of utilizing pre-trained stable diffusion for image restoration and propose MRIR, a diffusion-based restoration method with multimodal insights. Specifically, we explore the problem from two perspectives: textual level and visual level. For the textual level, we harness the power of the pre-trained multimodal large language model to infer meaningful semantic information from low-quality images. Furthermore, we employ the CLIP image encoder with a designed Refine Layer to capture image details as a supplement. For the visual level, we mainly focus on the pixel level control. Thus, we utilize a Pixel-level Processor and ControlNet to control spatial structures. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned control information into the denoising U-Net using multi-level attention mechanisms and realize controllable image restoration with multimodal insights. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate our method's superiority over other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on a pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the self-attention layer with the proposed cross-previous-frame attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between neighboring frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy for better temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in producing temporally consistent videos with better fidelity.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Improving Diffusion Inverse Problem Solving with Decoupled Noise Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01521v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems. For example, we achieve a PSNR of 30.72dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for phase retrieval, which is an improvement of 9.12dB compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Inversion using Latent Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01027v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for solving inverse problems due to their exceptional ability to model complex prior distributions. However, existing methods predominantly assume known forward operators (i.e., non-blind), limiting their applicability in practical settings where acquiring such operators is costly. Additionally, many current approaches rely on pixel-space diffusion models, leaving the potential of more powerful latent diffusion models (LDMs) underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LatentDEM, an innovative technique that addresses more challenging blind inverse problems using latent diffusion priors. At the core of our method is solving blind inverse problems within an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework: (1) the E-step recovers clean images from corrupted observations using LDM priors and a known forward model, and (2) the M-step estimates the forward operator based on the recovered images. Additionally, we propose two novel optimization techniques tailored for LDM priors and EM frameworks, yielding more accurate and efficient blind inversion results. As a general framework, LatentDEM supports both linear and non-linear inverse problems. Beyond common 2D image restoration tasks, it enables new capabilities in non-linear 3D inverse rendering problems. We validate LatentDEM's performance on representative 2D blind deblurring and 3D sparse-view reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its superior efficacy over prior arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Frequency-Aware Dynamic Transformers for All-In-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01636v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to tackle the all-in-one image restoration task, which seeks to handle multiple types of degradation with a single model. The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Recognizing that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new all-in-one image restoration approach from a frequency perspective, leveraging advanced vision transformers. Our method consists of two main components: a frequency-aware Degradation prior learning transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing inputs into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods on four representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing and deblurring. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling spatially variant degradations and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Instruct-IPT: All-in-One Image Processing Transformer via Weight Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00676v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the unaffordable size and intensive computation costs of low-level vision models, All-in-One models that are designed to address a handful of low-level vision tasks simultaneously have been popular. However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. Rather than popular feature adaptation methods, we propose weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we figure out task-sensitive weights via a toy experiment and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. Further, we propose to maneuver Instruct-IPT with text instructions for better user interfaces. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well. The code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-IPT.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we focus on the task of all-in-one medical image restoration, aiming to address multiple distinct MedIR tasks with a single universal model. Nonetheless, due to significant differences between different MedIR tasks, training a universal model often encounters task interference issues, where different tasks with shared parameters may conflict with each other in the gradient update direction. This task interference leads to deviation of the model update direction from the optimal path, thereby affecting the model's performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a task-adaptive routing strategy, allowing conflicting tasks to select different network paths in spatial and channel dimensions, thereby mitigating task interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed \textbf{A}ll-in-one \textbf{M}edical \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration (\textbf{AMIR}) network achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis, both in single-task and all-in-one settings.

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise-space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how the multi-step denoising process is influenced by auxiliary conditional inputs, we obtain meaningful gradients from noise prediction to gradually align the restored results of both synthetic and real-world data to a common clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during training, we present useful techniques such as channel shuffling and residual-swapping contrastive learning. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The joint training process of IRConStyle, an Image Restoration framework consisting of ConStyle and a general restoration network, is divided into two stages: first, pre-training ConStyle alone, and then freezing its weights to guide the training of the general restoration network. Three improvements are proposed in the pre-training stage to train ConStyle: unsupervised pre-training, adding a pretext task (i.e. classification), and adopting knowledge distillation. Without bells and whistles, we can get ConStyle v2, a strong prompter for all-in-one Image Restoration, in less than two GPU days and doesn't require any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on Restormer (transformer-based), NAFNet (CNN-based), MAXIM-1S (MLP-based), and a vanilla CNN network demonstrate that ConStyle v2 can enhance any U-Net style Image Restoration models to all-in-one Image Restoration models. Furthermore, models guided by the well-trained ConStyle v2 exhibit superior performance in some specific degradation compared to ConStyle.</p></details> |  |
| **[MFDNet: Multi-Frequency Deflare Network for Efficient Nighttime Flare Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18079v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When light is scattered or reflected accidentally in the lens, flare artifacts may appear in the captured photos, affecting the photos' visual quality. The main challenge in flare removal is to eliminate various flare artifacts while preserving the original content of the image. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight Multi-Frequency Deflare Network (MFDNet) based on the Laplacian Pyramid. Our network decomposes the flare-corrupted image into low and high-frequency bands, effectively separating the illumination and content information in the image. The low-frequency part typically contains illumination information, while the high-frequency part contains detailed content information. So our MFDNet consists of two main modules: the Low-Frequency Flare Perception Module (LFFPM) to remove flare in the low-frequency part and the Hierarchical Fusion Reconstruction Module (HFRM) to reconstruct the flare-free image. Specifically, to perceive flare from a global perspective while retaining detailed information for image restoration, LFFPM utilizes Transformer to extract global information while utilizing a convolutional neural network to capture detailed local features. Then HFRM gradually fuses the outputs of LFFPM with the high-frequency component of the image through feature aggregation. Moreover, our MFDNet can reduce the computational cost by processing in multiple frequency bands instead of directly removing the flare on the input image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in removing nighttime flare on real-world and synthetic images from the Flare7K dataset. Furthermore, the computational complexity of our model is remarkably low.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Visual Computer journal</p></details> |
| **[Graph Image Prior for Unsupervised Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15770v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can be a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> |  |
| **[DaLPSR: Leverage Degradation-Aligned Language Prompt for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16477v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level, especially in real-world cases based on reference-free metrics.</p></details> |  |

This task is complicated by the varying categories and geometries of real-world objects and the scarcity of datasets encompassing diverse HOIs. To circumvent the need for extensive data, we leverage text-to-image diffusion models trained on billions of image-caption pairs. We optimize the articulation of a skinned human mesh using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) gradients obtained from these models, which predict image-space edits. However, directly backpropagating image-space gradients into complex articulation parameters is ineffective due to the local nature of such gradients. To overcome this, we introduce a dual implicit-explicit representation of a skinned mesh, combining (implicit) neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with (explicit) skeleton-driven mesh articulation. During optimization, we transition between implicit and explicit forms, grounding the NeRF generation while refining the mesh articulation. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating realistic HOIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://DreamHOI.github.io/</p></details> |

Existing SDS methods often struggle with this generation task due to a limited understanding of part-level semantics in text-to-image diffusion models. While recent diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion 3, demonstrate a better part-level understanding, they are prohibitively slow and exhibit other common problems associated with single-view diffusion models. DreamBeast overcomes this limitation through a novel part-aware knowledge transfer mechanism. For each generated asset, we efficiently extract part-level knowledge from the Stable Diffusion 3 model into a 3D Part-Affinity implicit representation. This enables us to instantly generate Part-Affinity maps from arbitrary camera views, which we then use to modulate the guidance of a multi-view diffusion model during SDS to create 3D assets of fantastical animals. DreamBeast significantly enhances the quality of generated 3D creatures with user-specified part compositions while reducing computational overhead, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dreambeast3d.github.io/, code: https://github.com/runjiali-rl/threestudio-dreambeast</p></details> |

This has made it challenging to develop general-purpose touch processing methods since models are generally tied to one specific sensor design. We address this problem by performing cross-modal prediction between touch sensors: given the tactile signal from one sensor, we use a generative model to estimate how the same physical contact would be perceived by another sensor. This allows us to apply sensor-specific methods to the generated signal. We implement this idea by training a diffusion model to translate between the popular GelSlim and Soft Bubble sensors. As a downstream task, we perform in-hand object pose estimation using GelSlim sensors while using an algorithm that operates only on Soft Bubble signals. The dataset, the code, and additional details can be found at https://www.mmintlab.com/research/touch2touch/.</p></details> |  |

However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.

| **[Improving Text-guided Object Inpainting with Semantic Pre-inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08260v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the success of large text-to-image diffusion models and their remarkable potential to generate high-quality images. The further pursuit of enhancing the editability of images has sparked significant interest in the downstream task of inpainting a novel object described by a text prompt within a designated region in the image. Nevertheless, the problem is not trivial from two aspects: 1) Solely relying on one single U-Net to align text prompt and visual object across all the denoising timesteps is insufficient to generate desired objects; 2) The controllability of object generation is not guaranteed in the intricate sampling space of diffusion model. In this paper, we propose to decompose the typical single-stage object inpainting into two cascaded processes: 1) semantic pre-inpainting that infers the semantic features of desired objects in a multi-modal feature space; 2) high-fieldity object generation in diffusion latent space that pivots on such inpainted semantic features. To achieve this, we cascade a Transformer-based semantic inpainter and an object inpainting diffusion model, leading to a novel CAscaded Transformer-Diffusion (CAT-Diffusion) framework for text-guided object inpainting. Technically, the semantic inpainter is trained to predict the semantic features of the target object conditioning on unmasked context and text prompt. The outputs of the semantic inpainter then act as the informative visual prompts to guide high-fieldity object generation through a reference adapter layer, leading to controllable object inpainting. Extensive evaluations on OpenImages-V6 and MSCOCO validate the superiority of CAT-Diffusion against the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Improving Virtual Try-On with Garment-focused Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08258v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have led to the revolutionizing of generative modeling in numerous image synthesis tasks. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to directly apply diffusion models for synthesizing an image of a target person wearing a given in-shop garment, i.e., image-based virtual try-on (VTON) task. The difficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion process should not only produce holistically high-fidelity photorealistic image of the target person, but also locally preserve every appearance and texture detail of the given garment. To address this, we shape a new Diffusion model, namely GarDiff, which triggers the garment-focused diffusion process with amplified guidance of both basic visual appearance and detailed textures (i.e., high-frequency details) derived from the given garment. GarDiff first remoulds a pre-trained latent diffusion model with additional appearance priors derived from the CLIP and VAE encodings of the reference garment. Meanwhile, a novel garment-focused adapter is integrated into the UNet of diffusion model, pursuing local fine-grained alignment with the visual appearance of reference garment and human pose. We specifically design an appearance loss over the synthesized garment to enhance the crucial, high-frequency details. Extensive experiments on VITON-HD and DressCode datasets demonstrate the superiority of our GarDiff when compared to state-of-the-art VTON approaches.

By theoretically characterizing the inherent purification errors associated with the Markov-based diffusion purifications, we introduce LoRID, a novel Low-Rank Iterative Diffusion purification method designed to remove adversarial perturbation with low intrinsic purification errors. LoRID centers around a multi-stage purification process that leverages multiple rounds of diffusion-denoising loops at the early time-steps of the diffusion models, and the integration of Tucker decomposition, an extension of matrix factorization, to remove adversarial noise at high-noise regimes. Consequently, LoRID increases the effective diffusion time-steps and overcomes strong adversarial attacks, achieving superior robustness performance in CIFAR-10/100, CelebA-HQ, and ImageNet datasets under both white-box and black-box settings.</p></details> | LA-UR-24-28834 |
| **[Dynamic Prompting of Frozen Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Panoptic Narrative Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08251v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoptic narrative grounding (PNG), whose core target is fine-grained image-text alignment, requires a panoptic segmentation of referred objects given a narrative caption. Previous discriminative methods achieve only weak or coarse-grained alignment by panoptic segmentation pretraining or CLIP model adaptation. Given the recent progress of text-to-image Diffusion models, several works have shown their capability to achieve fine-grained image-text alignment through cross-attention maps and improved general segmentation performance. However, the direct use of phrase features as static prompts to apply frozen Diffusion models to the PNG task still suffers from a large task gap and insufficient vision-language interaction, yielding inferior performance. Therefore, we propose an Extractive-Injective Phrase Adapter (EIPA) bypass within the Diffusion UNet to dynamically update phrase prompts with image features and inject the multimodal cues back, which leverages the fine-grained image-text alignment capability of Diffusion models more sufficiently. In addition, we also design a Multi-Level Mutual Aggregation (MLMA) module to reciprocally fuse multi-level image and phrase features for segmentation refinement. Extensive experiments on the PNG benchmark show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024</p></details> |
| **[IFAdapter: Instance Feature Control for Grounded Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08240v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models excel at generating visually appealing images of individual instances, they struggle to accurately position and control the features generation of multiple instances. The Layout-to-Image (L2I) task was introduced to address the positioning challenges by incorporating bounding boxes as spatial control signals, but it still falls short in generating precise instance features. In response, we propose the Instance Feature Generation (IFG) task, which aims to ensure both positional accuracy and feature fidelity in generated instances. To address the IFG task, we introduce the Instance Feature Adapter (IFAdapter). The IFAdapter enhances feature depiction by incorporating additional appearance tokens and utilizing an Instance Semantic Map to align instance-level features with spatial locations. The IFAdapter guides the diffusion process as a plug-and-play module, making it adaptable to various community models. For evaluation, we contribute an IFG benchmark and develop a verification pipeline to objectively compare models' abilities to generate instances with accurate positioning and features. Experimental results demonstrate that IFAdapter outperforms other models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in diffusion models have shown impressive results in 3D object generation, but are limited in spatial extent and quality when extended to 3D scenes. To generate complex and diverse 3D scene structures, we introduce a latent tree representation to effectively encode both lower-frequency geometry and higher-frequency detail in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy. We can then learn a generative diffusion process in this latent 3D scene space, modeling the latent components of a scene at each resolution level. To synthesize large-scale scenes with varying sizes, we train our diffusion model on scene patches and synthesize arbitrary-sized output 3D scenes through shared diffusion generation across multiple scene patches. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and benefits of LT3SD for large-scale, high-quality unconditional 3D scene generation and for probabilistic completion for partial scene observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://quan-meng.github.io/projects/lt3sd/ Video: https://youtu.be/AJ5sG9VyjGA</p></details> |
| **[VI3DRM:Towards meticulous 3D Reconstruction from Sparse Views via Photo-Realistic Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08207v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, methods like Zero-1-2-3 have focused on single-view based 3D reconstruction and have achieved remarkable success. However, their predictions for unseen areas heavily rely on the inductive bias of large-scale pretrained diffusion models. Although subsequent work, such as DreamComposer, attempts to make predictions more controllable by incorporating additional views, the results remain unrealistic due to feature entanglement in the vanilla latent space, including factors such as lighting, material, and structure. To address these issues, we introduce the Visual Isotropy 3D Reconstruction Model (VI3DRM), a diffusion-based sparse views 3D reconstruction model that operates within an ID consistent and perspective-disentangled 3D latent space. By facilitating the disentanglement of semantic information, color, material properties and lighting, VI3DRM is capable of generating highly realistic images that are indistinguishable from real photographs. By leveraging both real and synthesized images, our approach enables the accurate construction of pointmaps, ultimately producing finely textured meshes or point clouds. On the NVS task, tested on the GSO dataset, VI3DRM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art method DreamComposer, achieving a PSNR of 38.61, an SSIM of 0.929, and an LPIPS of 0.027.

| **[MagicStyle: Portrait Stylization Based on Reference Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08156v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of diffusion models has significantly advanced the research on image stylization, particularly in the area of stylizing a content image based on a given style image, which has attracted many scholars. The main challenge in this reference image stylization task lies in how to maintain the details of the content image while incorporating the color and texture features of the style image. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when the content image is a portrait which has complex textural details. To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion model-based reference image stylization method specifically for portraits, called MagicStyle. MagicStyle consists of two phases: Content and Style DDIM Inversion (CSDI) and Feature Fusion Forward (FFF). The CSDI phase involves a reverse denoising process, where DDIM Inversion is performed separately on the content image and the style image, storing the self-attention query, key and value features of both images during the inversion process. The FFF phase executes forward denoising, harmoniously integrating the texture and color information from the pre-stored feature queries, keys and values into the diffusion generation process based on our Well-designed Feature Fusion Attention (FFA). We conducted comprehensive comparative and ablation experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed MagicStyle and FFA.</p></details> |  |

The challenge lies in preserving the subject's identity while aligning with the text prompt, which often requires modifying certain aspects of the subject's appearance. Despite advancements in diffusion model based methods, existing approaches still struggle to balance identity preservation with text prompt alignment. In this study, we conducted an in-depth investigation into this issue and uncovered key insights for achieving effective identity preservation while maintaining a strong balance. Our key findings include: (1) the design of the subject image encoder significantly impacts identity preservation quality, and (2) generating an initial layout is crucial for both text alignment and identity preservation. Building on these insights, we introduce a new approach called EZIGen, which employs two main strategies: a carefully crafted subject image Encoder based on the UNet architecture of the pretrained Stable Diffusion model to ensure high-quality identity transfer, following a process that decouples the guidance stages and iteratively refines the initial image layout. Through these strategies, EZIGen achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple subject-driven benchmarks with a unified model and 100 times less training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToolEENet: Tool Affordance 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04193v2)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration of robotic dexterous hands utilizing tools has recently attracted considerable attention. A significant challenge in this field is the precise awareness of a tool's pose when grasped, as occlusion by the hand often degrades the quality of the estimation. Additionally, the tool's overall pose often fails to accurately represent the contact interaction, thereby limiting the effectiveness of vision-guided, contact-dependent activities. To overcome this limitation, we present the innovative TOOLEE dataset, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to feature affordance segmentation of a tool's end-effector (EE) along with its defined 6D pose based on its usage. Furthermore, we propose the ToolEENet framework for accurate 6D pose estimation of the tool's EE. This framework begins by segmenting the tool's EE from raw RGBD data, then uses a diffusion model-based pose estimator for 6D pose estimation at a category-specific level. Addressing the issue of symmetry in pose estimation, we introduce a symmetry-aware pose representation that enhances the consistency of pose estimation. Our approach excels in this field, demonstrating high levels of precision and generalization. Furthermore, it shows great promise for application in contact-based manipulation scenarios.

Our approach revises the original noise prediction network of a pretrained diffusion model by introducing a noise correction term. We formulate the noise correction term as the difference between two noise predictions; one is computed from the denoising network with a progressive interpolation of the source and target prompt embeddings, while the other is the noise prediction with the source prompt embedding. The final noise prediction network is given by a linear combination of the standard denoising term and the noise correction term, where the former is designed to reconstruct must-be-preserved regions while the latter aims to effectively edit regions of interest relevant to the target prompt. Our approach can be easily incorporated into existing image-to-image translation methods based on diffusion models. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed technique achieves outstanding performance with low latency and consistently improves existing frameworks when combined with them.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing this AI search engine, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ and B$_5$CN$_2$ whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Thus, benchmarking and advancing techniques detecting digital manipulation become an urgent issue. Although there have been a number of publicly available face forgery datasets, the forgery faces are mostly generated using GAN-based synthesis technology, which does not involve the most recent technologies like diffusion. The diversity and quality of images generated by diffusion models have been significantly improved and thus a much more challenging face forgery dataset shall be used to evaluate SOTA forgery detection literature. In this paper, we propose a large-scale, diverse, and fine-grained high-fidelity dataset, namely GenFace, to facilitate the advancement of deepfake detection, which contains a large number of forgery faces generated by advanced generators such as the diffusion-based model and more detailed labels about the manipulation approaches and adopted generators. In addition to evaluating SOTA approaches on our benchmark, we design an innovative cross appearance-edge learning (CAEL) detector to capture multi-grained appearance and edge global representations, and detect discriminative and general forgery traces. Moreover, we devise an appearance-edge cross-attention (AECA) module to explore the various integrations across two domains. Extensive experiment results and visualizations show that our detection model outperforms the state of the arts on different settings like cross-generator, cross-forgery, and cross-dataset evaluations.

Existing approaches using textual inputs combined with bounding boxes or region masks fall short in providing precise spatial guidance, often leading to misaligned or unintended object orientation. To address these limitations, we propose Scribble-Guided Diffusion (ScribbleDiff), a training-free approach that utilizes simple user-provided scribbles as visual prompts to guide image generation. However, incorporating scribbles into diffusion models presents challenges due to their sparse and thin nature, making it difficult to ensure accurate orientation alignment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce moment alignment and scribble propagation, which allow for more effective and flexible alignment between generated images and scribble inputs. Experimental results on the PASCAL-Scribble dataset demonstrate significant improvements in spatial control and consistency, showcasing the effectiveness of scribble-based guidance in diffusion models.

The focus of this study is taken to be Taiwan, an area very vulnerable to typhoons. By comparing the performance of Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CDDPM) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), results suggest that the CDDPM performs best in generating accurate and realistic meteorological data. Specifically, CDDPM achieved a PSNR of 32.807, which is approximately 7.9% higher than CNN and 5.5% higher than SENet. Furthermore, CDDPM recorded an RMSE of 0.032, showing a 11.1% improvement over CNN and 8.6% improvement over SENet. A key application of this research can be for imputation purposes in missing meteorological datasets and generate additional high-quality meteorological data using satellite images. It is hoped that the results of this analysis will enable more robust and detailed forecasting, reducing the impact of severe weather events on vulnerable regions.

In particular, the diffusion model, a core component of generative AI, produces high-quality images with rich diversity. In this study, we proposed a novel computed tomography (CT) reconstruction method by combining the denoising diffusion probabilistic model with iterative CT reconstruction. In sharp contrast to previous studies, we optimized the fidelity loss of CT reconstruction with respect to the latent variable of the diffusion model, instead of the image and model parameters. To suppress the changes in anatomical structures produced by the diffusion model, we shallowed the diffusion and reverse processes and fixed a set of added noises in the reverse process to make it deterministic during the inference. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method through the sparse-projection CT reconstruction of 1/10 projection data. Despite the simplicity of the implementation, the proposed method has the potential to reconstruct high-quality images while preserving the patient's anatomical structures and was found to outperform existing methods, including iterative reconstruction, iterative reconstruction with total variation, and the diffusion model alone in terms of quantitative indices such as the structural similarity index and peak signal-to-noise ratio. We also explored further sparse-projection CT reconstruction using 1/20 projection data with the same trained diffusion model. As the number of iterations increased, the image quality improved comparable to that of 1/10 sparse-projection CT reconstruction. In principle, this method can be widely applied not only to CT but also to other imaging modalities.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

This method benefits pixel-wise annotation tasks requiring much effort and intensive labor. Traditional data augmentation methods involve simple transformations like rotations and flips to create new images from existing ones. However, these new images may lack diversity along the main semantic axes in the data and not change high-level semantic properties. To address this issue, generative models have emerged as an effective solution for augmenting data by generating synthetic images. Controllable generative models offer a way to augment data for semantic segmentation tasks using a prompt and visual reference from the original image. However, using these models directly presents challenges, such as creating an effective prompt and visual reference to generate a synthetic image that accurately reflects the content and structure of the original. In this work, we introduce an effective data augmentation method for semantic segmentation using the Controllable Diffusion Model. Our proposed method includes efficient prompt generation using Class-Prompt Appending and Visual Prior Combination to enhance attention to labeled classes in real images. These techniques allow us to generate images that accurately depict segmented classes in the real image. In addition, we employ the class balancing algorithm to ensure efficiency when merging the synthetic and original images to generate balanced data for the training dataset. We evaluated our method on the PASCAL VOC datasets and found it highly effective for synthesizing images in semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Our study introduces a novel multi-modal approach to detect AI-generated images amidst the proliferation of new generation methods such as Diffusion models. Our method, UGAD, encompasses three key detection steps: First, we transform the RGB images into YCbCr channels and apply an Integral Radial Operation to emphasize salient radial features. Secondly, the Spatial Fourier Extraction operation is used for a spatial shift, utilizing a pre-trained deep learning network for optimal feature extraction. Finally, the deep neural network classification stage processes the data through dense layers using softmax for classification. Our approach significantly enhances the accuracy of differentiating between real and AI-generated images, as evidenced by a 12.64% increase in accuracy and 28.43% increase in AUC compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning methods and the expanded availability of experimental 3D protein structures have accelerated structure prediction, the dynamic nature of protein structures has received limited attention. This study introduces an innovative 4D diffusion model incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data to learn dynamic protein structures. Our approach is distinguished by the following components: (1) a unified diffusion model capable of generating dynamic protein structures, including both the backbone and side chains, utilizing atomic grouping and side-chain dihedral angle predictions; (2) a reference network that enhances structural consistency by integrating the latent embeddings of the initial 3D protein structures; and (3) a motion alignment module aimed at improving temporal structural coherence across multiple time steps. To our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based model aimed at predicting protein trajectories across multiple time steps simultaneously. Validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that our model exhibits high accuracy in predicting dynamic 3D structures of proteins containing up to 256 amino acids over 32 time steps, effectively capturing both local flexibility in stable states and significant conformational changes.</p></details> |  |

They do, however, require a large amount of computational resources. This limits their application to medical tasks, where we often deal with large 3D volumes, like high-resolution three-dimensional data. In this work, we present a number of different ways to reduce the resource consumption for 3D diffusion models and apply them to a dataset of 3D images. The main contribution of this paper is the memory-efficient patch-based diffusion model \textit{PatchDDM}, which can be applied to the total volume during inference while the training is performed only on patches. While the proposed diffusion model can be applied to any image generation tasks, we evaluate the method on the tumor segmentation task of the BraTS2020 dataset and demonstrate that we can generate meaningful three-dimensional segmentations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MIDL 2023</p></details> |
| **[3D Priors-Guided Diffusion for Blind Face Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00991v2)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind face restoration endeavors to restore a clear face image from a degraded counterpart. Recent approaches employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as priors have demonstrated remarkable success in this field. However, these methods encounter challenges in achieving a balance between realism and fidelity, particularly in complex degradation scenarios. To inherit the exceptional realism generative ability of the diffusion model and also constrained by the identity-aware fidelity, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework by embedding the 3D facial priors as structure and identity constraints into a denoising diffusion process. Specifically, in order to obtain more accurate 3D prior representations, the 3D facial image is reconstructed by a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) using an initial restored face image that has been processed by a pretrained restoration network. A customized multi-level feature extraction method is employed to exploit both structural and identity information of 3D facial images, which are then mapped into the noise estimation process. In order to enhance the fusion of identity information into the noise estimation, we propose a Time-Aware Fusion Block (TAFB). This module offers a more efficient and adaptive fusion of weights for denoising, considering the dynamic nature of the denoising process in the diffusion model, which involves initial structure refinement followed by texture detail enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets for blind face restoration.

Existing methods focus predominantly on single-property optimization, necessitating repetitive runs to target multiple properties, which is inefficient and computationally expensive. Moreover, these methods often lack transparency, making it difficult for researchers to understand and control the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Explainable Multi-property Optimization of Molecules (XMOL), to optimize multiple molecular properties simultaneously while incorporating explainability. Our approach builds on state-of-the-art geometric diffusion models, extending them to multi-property optimization through the introduction of spectral normalization and enhanced molecular constraints for stabilized training. Additionally, we integrate interpretive and explainable techniques throughout the optimization process. We evaluated XMOL on the real-world molecular datasets i.e., QM9, demonstrating its effectiveness in both single property and multiple properties optimization while offering interpretable results, paving the way for more efficient and reliable molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiTAS: Quantizing Diffusion Transformers via Enhanced Activation Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07756v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently attracted significant interest from both industry and academia due to their enhanced capabilities in visual generation, surpassing the performance of traditional diffusion models that employ U-Net. However, the improved performance of DiTs comes at the expense of higher parameter counts and implementation costs, which significantly limits their deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones. We propose DiTAS, a data-free post-training quantization (PTQ) method for efficient DiT inference. DiTAS relies on the proposed temporal-aggregated smoothing techniques to mitigate the impact of the channel-wise outliers within the input activations, leading to much lower quantization error under extremely low bitwidth. To further enhance the performance of the quantized DiT, we adopt the layer-wise grid search strategy to optimize the smoothing factor. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W4A8) quantization for DiTs while maintaining comparable performance as the full-precision model.</p></details> |  |
| **[CFG++: Manifold-constrained Classifier Free Guidance for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08070v2)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a fundamental tool in modern diffusion models for text-guided generation. Although effective, CFG has notable drawbacks. For instance, DDIM with CFG lacks invertibility, complicating image editing; furthermore, high guidance scales, essential for high-quality outputs, frequently result in issues like mode collapse. Contrary to the widespread belief that these are inherent limitations of diffusion models, this paper reveals that the problems actually stem from the off-manifold phenomenon associated with CFG, rather than the diffusion models themselves. More specifically, inspired by the recent advancements of diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers (DIS), we reformulate text-guidance as an inverse problem with a text-conditioned score matching loss and develop CFG++, a novel approach that tackles the off-manifold challenges inherent in traditional CFG. CFG++ features a surprisingly simple fix to CFG, yet it offers significant improvements, including better sample quality for text-to-image generation, invertibility, smaller guidance scales, reduced mode collapse, etc. Furthermore, CFG++ enables seamless interpolation between unconditional and conditional sampling at lower guidance scales, consistently outperforming traditional CFG at all scales. Moreover, CFG++ can be easily integrated into high-order diffusion solvers and naturally extends to distilled diffusion models. Experimental results confirm that our method significantly enhances performance in text-to-image generation, DDIM inversion, editing, and solving inverse problems, suggesting a wide-ranging impact and potential applications in various fields that utilize text guidance.

However, they are likely to fall short when it comes to real-life scenarios with intricate details. The low-quality, unrealistic human faces in text-to-image generation are one of the most prominent issues, hindering the wide application of DMs in practice. Targeting addressing such an issue, we first assess the face quality of generations from popular pre-trained DMs with the aid of human annotators and then evaluate the alignment between existing metrics with human judgments. Observing that existing metrics can be unsatisfactory for quantifying face quality, we develop a novel metric named FaceScore (FS) by fine-tuning the widely used ImageReward on a dataset of (win, loss) face pairs cheaply crafted by an inpainting pipeline of DMs. Extensive studies reveal FS enjoys a superior alignment with humans. On the other hand, FS opens up the door for enhancing DMs for better face generation. With FS offering image ratings, we can easily perform preference learning algorithms to refine DMs like SDXL. Comprehensive experiments verify the efficacy of our approach for improving face quality. The code is released at https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/FaceScore.</p></details> | Under review |

In contrast to existing general-purpose model editing techniques, which unlearn concepts without considering the associated contexts, Moderator allows admins to specify what content should be moderated, under which context, how it should be moderated, and why moderation is necessary. Given a set of policies, Moderator first prompts the original model to generate images that need to be moderated, then uses these self-generated images to reverse fine-tune the model to compute task vectors for moderation and finally negates the original model with the task vectors to decrease its performance in generating moderated content. We evaluated Moderator with 14 participants to play the role of admins and found they could quickly learn and author policies to pass unit tests in approximately 2.29 policy iterations. Our experiment with 32 stable diffusion users suggested that Moderator can prevent 65% of users from generating moderated content under 15 attempts and require the remaining users an average of 8.3 times more attempts to generate undesired content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CCS 2024</p></details> |

Furthermore, the gestures produced by these methods often appear overly smooth or subdued, lacking in diversity, and many gesture-centric approaches do not integrate talking head generation. To address these limitations, we introduce DiffTED, a new approach for one-shot audio-driven TED-style talking video generation from a single image. Specifically, we leverage a diffusion model to generate sequences of keypoints for a Thin-Plate Spline motion model, precisely controlling the avatar's animation while ensuring temporally coherent and diverse gestures. This innovative approach utilizes classifier-free guidance, empowering the gestures to flow naturally with the audio input without relying on pre-trained classifiers. Experiments demonstrate that DiffTED generates temporally coherent talking videos with diverse co-speech gestures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Augmentation for Supervised Graph Outlier Detection with Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17679v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph outlier detection is a prominent task of research and application in the realm of graph neural networks. It identifies the outlier nodes that exhibit deviation from the majority in the graph. One of the fundamental challenges confronting supervised graph outlier detection algorithms is the prevalent issue of class imbalance, where the scarcity of outlier instances compared to normal instances often results in suboptimal performance. Conventional methods mitigate the imbalance by reweighting instances in the estimation of the loss function, assigning higher weights to outliers and lower weights to inliers. Nonetheless, these strategies are prone to overfitting and underfitting, respectively. Recently, generative models, especially diffusion models, have demonstrated their efficacy in synthesizing high-fidelity images. Despite their extraordinary generation quality, their potential in data augmentation for supervised graph outlier detection remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GODM, a novel data augmentation for mitigating class imbalance in supervised Graph Outlier detection with latent Diffusion Models. Specifically, our proposed method consists of three key components: (1) Variantioanl Encoder maps the heterogeneous information inherent within the graph data into a unified latent space. (2) Graph Generator synthesizes graph data that are statistically similar to real outliers from latent space, and (3) Latent Diffusion Model learns the latent space distribution of real organic data by iterative denoising. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of GODM. The case study further demonstrated the generation quality of our synthetic data. To foster accessibility and reproducibility, we encapsulate GODM into a plug-and-play package and release it at the Python Package Index (PyPI).</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Nevertheless, the implicit 3D representations of NeRF lack explicit modeling of meshes and textures over surfaces, and such surface-undefined way may suffer from the issues, e.g., noisy surfaces with ambiguous texture details or cross-view inconsistency. To alleviate this, we present DreamMesh, a novel text-to-3D architecture that pivots on well-defined surfaces (triangle meshes) to generate high-fidelity explicit 3D model. Technically, DreamMesh capitalizes on a distinctive coarse-to-fine scheme. In the coarse stage, the mesh is first deformed by text-guided Jacobians and then DreamMesh textures the mesh with an interlaced use of 2D diffusion models in a tuning free manner from multiple viewpoints. In the fine stage, DreamMesh jointly manipulates the mesh and refines the texture map, leading to high-quality triangle meshes with high-fidelity textured materials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamMesh significantly outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-3D methods in faithfully generating 3D content with richer textual details and enhanced geometry.

In this work, we present High-resolution Image-to-3D model (Hi3D), a new video diffusion based paradigm that redefines a single image to multi-view images as 3D-aware sequential image generation (i.e., orbital video generation). This methodology delves into the underlying temporal consistency knowledge in video diffusion model that generalizes well to geometry consistency across multiple views in 3D generation. Technically, Hi3D first empowers the pre-trained video diffusion model with 3D-aware prior (camera pose condition), yielding multi-view images with low-resolution texture details. A 3D-aware video-to-video refiner is learnt to further scale up the multi-view images with high-resolution texture details. Such high-resolution multi-view images are further augmented with novel views through 3D Gaussian Splatting, which are finally leveraged to obtain high-fidelity meshes via 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both novel view synthesis and single view reconstruction demonstrate that our Hi3D manages to produce superior multi-view consistency images with highly-detailed textures.

Exploring diffusion models to enhance the generated images nevertheless is not trivial and necessitates to delicately enrich plentiful details while preserving the visual appearance of key content in the original image. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely FreeEnhance, for content-consistent image enhancement using the off-the-shelf image diffusion models. Technically, FreeEnhance is a two-stage process that firstly adds random noise to the input image and then capitalizes on a pre-trained image diffusion model (i.e., Latent Diffusion Models) to denoise and enhance the image details. In the noising stage, FreeEnhance is devised to add lighter noise to the region with higher frequency to preserve the high-frequent patterns (e.g., edge, corner) in the original image. In the denoising stage, we present three target properties as constraints to regularize the predicted noise, enhancing images with high acutance and high visual quality. Extensive experiments conducted on the HPDv2 dataset demonstrate that our FreeEnhance outperforms the state-of-the-art image enhancement models in terms of quantitative metrics and human preference. More remarkably, FreeEnhance also shows higher human preference compared to the commercial image enhancement solution of Magnific AI.</p></details> | ACM Multimedia 2024 |

Current state-of-the-art methods, predominantly end-to-end, face limitations in reconstructing high-frequency details and often rely on constrained datasets like KAIST and CAVE, resulting in models with poor generalizability. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a novel one-step Diffusion Probabilistic Model within a self-supervised adaptation framework for Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI). Our approach leverages a pretrained SCI reconstruction network to generate initial predictions from two-dimensional measurements. Subsequently, a one-step diffusion model produces high-frequency residuals to enhance these initial predictions. Additionally, acknowledging the high costs associated with collecting MSIs, we develop a self-supervised paradigm based on the Equivariant Imaging (EI) framework. Experimental results validate the superiority of our model compared to previous methods, showcasing its simplicity and adaptability to various end-to-end or unfolding techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, imitation learning algorithms require a number of design choices ranging from the input modality, training objective, and 6-DoF end-effector pose representation. Diffusion-based methods have gained popularity as they enable predicting long-horizon trajectories and handle multimodal action distributions. Recently, Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) (or Rectified Flow) has been proposed as a more flexible generalization of diffusion models. In this paper, we investigate the application of CFM in the context of robotic policy learning and specifically study the interplay with the other design choices required to build an imitation learning algorithm. We show that CFM gives the best performance when combined with point cloud input observations. Additionally, we study the feasibility of a CFM formulation on the SO(3) manifold and evaluate its suitability with a simplified example.

However, two critical challenges persist: (1) inherent errors in samples due to model imperfections, and (2) the requirement of hundreds of functional evaluations (NFEs) to achieve high-quality samples. While existing solutions like importance sampling and distillation address these issues separately, they are often incompatible, as most distillation models lack the necessary density information for importance sampling. This paper introduces a novel sampling method that effectively combines Consistency Models (CMs) with importance sampling. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic energy functions and equivariant n-body particle systems. Our method produces unbiased samples using only 6-25 NFEs while achieving a comparable Effective Sample Size (ESS) to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) that require approximately 100 NFEs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

While inference with these systems on consumer-grade GPUs is increasingly feasible, training from scratch requires large captioned datasets and significant computational resources. In medical image generation, the limited availability of large, publicly accessible datasets with text reports poses challenges due to legal and ethical concerns. This work shows that adapting pre-trained Stable Diffusion models to medical imaging modalities is achievable by training text embeddings using Textual Inversion. In this study, we experimented with small medical datasets (100 samples each from three modalities) and trained within hours to generate diagnostically accurate images, as judged by an expert radiologist. Experiments with Textual Inversion training and inference parameters reveal the necessity of larger embeddings and more examples in the medical domain. Classification experiments show an increase in diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting prostate cancer on MRI, from 0.78 to 0.80. Further experiments demonstrate embedding flexibility through disease interpolation, combining pathologies, and inpainting for precise disease appearance control.

Currently, the diagnosis of facial paralysis remains a challenging task, often relying heavily on the subjective judgment and experience of clinicians, which can introduce variability and uncertainty in the assessment process. One promising application in real-life situations is the automatic estimation of facial paralysis. However, the scarcity of facial paralysis datasets limits the development of robust machine learning models for automated diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. To this end, this study aims to synthesize a high-quality facial paralysis dataset to address this gap, enabling more accurate and efficient algorithm training. Specifically, a novel Cycle Cross-Fusion Expression Generative Model (CCFExp) based on the diffusion model is proposed to combine different features of facial information and enhance the visual details of facial appearance and texture in facial regions, thus creating synthetic facial images that accurately represent various degrees and types of facial paralysis. We have qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the proposed method on the commonly used public clinical datasets of facial paralysis to demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods, generating more realistic facial images and maintaining identity consistency.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that better harnesses diffusion models for face-swapping by making following core contributions. (a) We propose to re-frame the face-swapping task as a self-supervised, train-time inpainting problem, enhancing the identity transfer while blending with the target image. (b) We introduce a multi-step Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling during training, reinforcing identity and perceptual similarities. (c) Third, we introduce CLIP feature disentanglement to extract pose, expression, and lighting information from the target image, improving fidelity. (d) Further, we introduce a mask shuffling technique during inpainting training, which allows us to create a so-called universal model for swapping, with an additional feature of head swapping. Ours can swap hair and even accessories, beyond traditional face swapping. Unlike prior works reliant on multiple off-the-shelf models, ours is a relatively unified approach and so it is resilient to errors in other off-the-shelf models.

While many existing approaches focus on lip synchronization and video quality, few tackle the challenge of generating emotion-driven talking head videos. The ability to control and edit emotions is essential for producing expressive and realistic animations. In response to this challenge, we propose EMOdiffhead, a novel method for emotional talking head video generation that not only enables fine-grained control of emotion categories and intensities but also enables one-shot generation. Given the FLAME 3D model's linearity in expression modeling, we utilize the DECA method to extract expression vectors, that are combined with audio to guide a diffusion model in generating videos with precise lip synchronization and rich emotional expressiveness. This approach not only enables the learning of rich facial information from emotion-irrelevant data but also facilitates the generation of emotional videos. It effectively overcomes the limitations of emotional data, such as the lack of diversity in facial and background information, and addresses the absence of emotional details in emotion-irrelevant data. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other emotion portrait animation methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

However, while a substantial amount of diffusion-based research has focused on generative tasks, no work introduces diffusion models to advance the results of polyp segmentation in videos, which is frequently challenged by polyps' high camouflage and redundant temporal cues.In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based network for video polyp segmentation task, dubbed as Diff-VPS. We incorporate multi-task supervision into diffusion models to promote the discrimination of diffusion models on pixel-by-pixel segmentation. This integrates the contextual high-level information achieved by the joint classification and detection tasks. To explore the temporal dependency, Temporal Reasoning Module (TRM) is devised via reasoning and reconstructing the target frame from the previous frames. We further equip TRM with a generative adversarial self-supervised strategy to produce more realistic frames and thus capture better dynamic cues. Extensive experiments are conducted on SUN-SEG, and the results indicate that our proposed Diff-VPS significantly achieves state-of-the-art performance.

| **[One-Shot Diffusion Mimicker for Handwritten Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04004v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing handwritten text generation methods often require more than ten handwriting samples as style references. However, in practical applications, users tend to prefer a handwriting generation model that operates with just a single reference sample for its convenience and efficiency. This approach, known as "one-shot generation", significantly simplifies the process but poses a significant challenge due to the difficulty of accurately capturing a writer's style from a single sample, especially when extracting fine details from the characters' edges amidst sparse foreground and undesired background noise. To address this problem, we propose a One-shot Diffusion Mimicker (One-DM) to generate handwritten text that can mimic any calligraphic style with only one reference sample. Inspired by the fact that high-frequency information of the individual sample often contains distinct style patterns (e.g., character slant and letter joining), we develop a novel style-enhanced module to improve the style extraction by incorporating high-frequency components from a single sample. We then fuse the style features with the text content as a merged condition for guiding the diffusion model to produce high-quality handwritten text images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can successfully generate handwriting scripts with just one sample reference in multiple languages, even outperforming previous methods using over ten samples. Our source code is available at https://github.com/dailenson/One-DM.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, current generative models rarely focus on enhancing camera motion control under multi-view tasks, which is essential for driving video generation. Therefore, we propose MyGo, an end-to-end framework for video generation, introducing motion of onboard cameras as conditions to make progress in camera controllability and multi-view consistency. MyGo employs additional plug-in modules to inject camera parameters into the pre-trained video diffusion model, which retains the extensive knowledge of the pre-trained model as much as possible. Furthermore, we use epipolar constraints and neighbor view information during the generation process of each view to enhance spatial-temporal consistency. Experimental results show that MyGo has achieved state-of-the-art results in both general camera-controlled video generation and multi-view driving video generation tasks, which lays the foundation for more accurate environment simulation in autonomous driving.

Unlike simpler music with limited timbres, such as MIDI-generated tunes or monophonic pieces, the focus here is on intricate music featuring a diverse array of instruments, voices, and effects, rich in harmonics and timbre. This study represents an initial foray into achieving general music reconstruction of high-quality using non-invasive EEG data, employing an end-to-end training approach directly on raw data without the need for manual pre-processing and channel selection. We train our models on the public NMED-T dataset and perform quantitative evaluation proposing neural embedding-based metrics. Our work contributes to the ongoing research in neural decoding and brain-computer interfaces, offering insights into the feasibility of using EEG data for complex auditory information reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Recent generative image compositing methods leverage diffusion models to handle multiple sub-tasks at once. However, existing models face limitations due to their reliance on masking the original object during training, which constrains their generation to the input mask. Furthermore, obtaining an accurate input mask specifying the location and scale of the object in a new image can be highly challenging. To overcome such limitations, we define a novel problem of unconstrained generative object compositing, i.e., the generation is not bounded by the mask, and train a diffusion-based model on a synthesized paired dataset. Our first-of-its-kind model is able to generate object effects such as shadows and reflections that go beyond the mask, enhancing image realism. Additionally, if an empty mask is provided, our model automatically places the object in diverse natural locations and scales, accelerating the compositing workflow. Our model outperforms existing object placement and compositing models in various quality metrics and user studies.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily rely on pre-trained video diffusion models, utilizing sampling processes or reference videos. However, these approaches face significant challenges. Firstly, the generated 4D content often fails to adhere to real-world physics since video diffusion models do not incorporate physical priors. Secondly, the extensive sampling process and the large number of parameters in diffusion models result in exceedingly time-consuming generation processes. To address these issues, we introduce Phy124, a novel, fast, and physics-driven method for controllable 4D content generation from a single image. Phy124 integrates physical simulation directly into the 4D generation process, ensuring that the resulting 4D content adheres to natural physical laws. Phy124 also eliminates the use of diffusion models during the 4D dynamics generation phase, significantly speeding up the process. Phy124 allows for the control of 4D dynamics, including movement speed and direction, by manipulating external forces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Phy124 generates high-fidelity 4D content with significantly reduced inference times, achieving stateof-the-art performance.

However, diffusion models typically rely on large parameter UNet backbones as policy networks, which can be challenging to deploy on resource-constrained devices. Recently, the Mamba model has emerged as a promising solution for efficient modeling, offering low computational complexity and strong performance in sequence modeling. In this work, we propose the Mamba Policy, a lighter but stronger policy that reduces the parameter count by over 80% compared to the original policy network while achieving superior performance. Specifically, we introduce the XMamba Block, which effectively integrates input information with conditional features and leverages a combination of Mamba and Attention mechanisms for deep feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the Mamba Policy excels on the Adroit, Dexart, and MetaWorld datasets, requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Additionally, we highlight the Mamba Policy's enhanced robustness in long-horizon scenarios compared to baseline methods and explore the performance of various Mamba variants within the Mamba Policy framework.

Existing datasets are typically limited to humans interacting with a single object while neglecting the ubiquitous manipulation of multiple objects. Thus, we propose HIMO, a large-scale MoCap dataset of full-body human interacting with multiple objects, containing 3.3K 4D HOI sequences and 4.08M 3D HOI frames. We also annotate HIMO with detailed textual descriptions and temporal segments, benchmarking two novel tasks of HOI synthesis conditioned on either the whole text prompt or the segmented text prompts as fine-grained timeline control. To address these novel tasks, we propose a dual-branch conditional diffusion model with a mutual interaction module for HOI synthesis. Besides, an auto-regressive generation pipeline is also designed to obtain smooth transitions between HOI segments. Experimental results demonstrate the generalization ability to unseen object geometries and temporal compositions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lvxintao.github.io/himo, accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, publicly available trajectory datasets remain limited in scale due to privacy concerns, which hinders the development of trajectory data mining and trajectory-based applications. To address this issue, some methods for generating synthetic trajectories have been proposed to expand the scale of the dataset. However, all existing methods generate trajectories in the geographical coordinate system, which poses two limitations for their utilization in practical applications: 1) the inability to ensure that the generated trajectories are constrained on the road. 2) the lack of road-related information. In this paper, we propose a new problem to meet the practical application need, \emph{i.e.}, road network-constrained trajectory (RNTraj) generation, which can directly generate trajectories on the road network with road-related information. RNTraj is a hybrid type of data, in which each point is represented by a discrete road segment and a continuous moving rate. To generate RNTraj, we design a diffusion model called Diff-RNTraj. This model can effectively handle the hybrid RNTraj using a continuous diffusion framework by incorporating a pre-training strategy to embed hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations. During the sampling stage, a RNTraj decoder is designed to map the continuous representation generated by the diffusion model back to the hybrid RNTraj format. Furthermore, Diff-RNTraj introduces a novel loss function to enhance the spatial validity of the generated trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

| **[From optimal score matching to optimal sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07032v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent, impressive advances in algorithmic generation of high-fidelity image, audio, and video are largely due to great successes in score-based diffusion models. A key implementing step is score matching, that is, the estimation of the score function of the forward diffusion process from training data. As shown in earlier literature, the total variation distance between the law of a sample generated from the trained diffusion model and the ground truth distribution can be controlled by the score matching risk. Despite the widespread use of score-based diffusion models, basic theoretical questions concerning exact optimal statistical rates for score estimation and its application to density estimation remain open. We establish the sharp minimax rate of score estimation for smooth, compactly supported densities. Formally, given \(n\) i.i.d. samples from an unknown \(\alpha\)-H\"{o}lder density \(f\) supported on \([-1, 1]\), we prove the minimax rate of estimating the score function of the diffused distribution \(f * \mathcal{N}(0, t)\) with respect to the score matching loss is \(\frac{1}{nt^2} \wedge \frac{1}{nt^{3/2}} \wedge (t^{\alpha-1} + n^{-2(\alpha-1)/(2\alpha+1)})\) for all \(\alpha > 0\) and \(t \ge 0\). As a consequence, it is shown the law \(\hat{f}\) of a sample generated from the diffusion model achieves the sharp minimax rate \(\bE(\dTV(\hat{f}, f)^2) \lesssim n^{-2\alpha/(2\alpha+1)}\) for all \(\alpha > 0\) without any extraneous logarithmic terms which are prevalent in the literature, and without the need for early stopping which has been required for all existing procedures to the best of our knowledge.</p></details> | 71 pages |
| **[CPSample: Classifier Protected Sampling for Guarding Training Data During Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07025v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have a tendency to exactly replicate their training data, especially when trained on small datasets. Most prior work has sought to mitigate this problem by imposing differential privacy constraints or masking parts of the training data, resulting in a notable substantial decrease in image quality. We present CPSample, a method that modifies the sampling process to prevent training data replication while preserving image quality. CPSample utilizes a classifier that is trained to overfit on random binary labels attached to the training data. CPSample then uses classifier guidance to steer the generation process away from the set of points that can be classified with high certainty, a set that includes the training data. CPSample achieves FID scores of 4.97 and 2.97 on CIFAR-10 and CelebA-64, respectively, without producing exact replicates of the training data. Unlike prior methods intended to guard the training images, CPSample only requires training a classifier rather than retraining a diffusion model, which is computationally cheaper. Moreover, our technique provides diffusion models with greater robustness against membership inference attacks, wherein an adversary attempts to discern which images were in the model's training dataset. We show that CPSample behaves like a built-in rejection sampler, and we demonstrate its capabilities to prevent mode collapse in Stable Diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Predicting Temporal Changes in a Patient's Chest X-ray Images based on Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07012v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chest X-ray imaging (CXR) is an important diagnostic tool used in hospitals to assess patient conditions and monitor changes over time. Generative models, specifically diffusion-based models, have shown promise in generating realistic synthetic X-rays. However, these models mainly focus on conditional generation using single-time-point data, i.e., typically CXRs taken at a specific time with their corresponding reports, limiting their clinical utility, particularly for capturing temporal changes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, EHRXDiff, which predicts future CXR images by integrating previous CXRs with subsequent medical events, e.g., prescriptions, lab measures, etc. Our framework dynamically tracks and predicts disease progression based on a latent diffusion model, conditioned on the previous CXR image and a history of medical events. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our framework across three key aspects, including clinical consistency, demographic consistency, and visual realism. We demonstrate that our framework generates high-quality, realistic future images that capture potential temporal changes, suggesting its potential for further development as a clinical simulation tool. This could offer valuable insights for patient monitoring and treatment planning in the medical field.</p></details> |  |

However, current monitoring systems are often destructive, typically involving dredging to physically collect and count oysters. A nondestructive alternative is manual identification from video footage collected by divers, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive with expert input. An alternative to human monitoring is the deployment of a system with trained object detection models that performs real-time, on edge oyster detection in the field. One such platform is the Aqua2 robot. Effective training of these models requires extensive high-quality data, which is difficult to obtain in marine settings. To address these complications, we introduce a novel method that leverages stable diffusion to generate high-quality synthetic data for the marine domain. We exploit diffusion models to create photorealistic marine imagery, using ControlNet inputs to ensure consistency with the segmentation ground-truth mask, the geometry of the scene, and the target domain of real underwater images for oysters. The resulting dataset is used to train a YOLOv10-based vision model, achieving a state-of-the-art 0.657 mAP@50 for oyster detection on the Aqua2 platform. The system we introduce not only improves oyster habitat monitoring, but also paves the way to autonomous surveillance for various tasks in marine contexts, improving aquaculture and conservation efforts.</p></details> |  |

Current research exploring the vulnerabilities using adversarial patches often struggles to balance the trade-off between attack effectiveness and visual quality. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework of patch attack from semantic perspective, which we refer to as AdvLogo. Based on the hypothesis that every semantic space contains an adversarial subspace where images can cause detectors to fail in recognizing objects, we leverage the semantic understanding of the diffusion denoising process and drive the process to adversarial subareas by perturbing the latent and unconditional embeddings at the last timestep. To mitigate the distribution shift that exposes a negative impact on image quality, we apply perturbation to the latent in frequency domain with the Fourier Transform. Experimental results demonstrate that AdvLogo achieves strong attack performance while maintaining high visual quality.</p></details> |  |

However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. Research on translating SAR images into optical-like representations has been conducted to aid the interpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and GAN-based approaches, this paper introduces a conditional image-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR). The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Unlike prior V2V methods using batches to process limited frames, we opt to process frames in a streaming fashion, to support unlimited frames. At the heart of StreamV2V lies a backward-looking principle that relates the present to the past. This is realized by maintaining a feature bank, which archives information from past frames. For incoming frames, StreamV2V extends self-attention to include banked keys and values and directly fuses similar past features into the output. The feature bank is continually updated by merging stored and new features, making it compact but informative. StreamV2V stands out for its adaptability and efficiency, seamlessly integrating with image diffusion models without fine-tuning. It can run 20 FPS on one A100 GPU, being 15x, 46x, 108x, and 158x faster than FlowVid, CoDeF, Rerender, and TokenFlow, respectively. Quantitative metrics and user studies confirm StreamV2V's exceptional ability to maintain temporal consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jeff-liangf.github.io/projects/streamv2v</p></details> |

RetinaRegNet addresses these challenges and achieves robust and accurate registration through the following steps. First, we extract features from the moving and fixed images using latent diffusion models. We then sample feature points from the fixed image using a combination of the SIFT algorithm and random point sampling. For each sampled point, we identify its corresponding point in the moving image using a 2D correlation map, which computes the cosine similarity between the diffusion feature vectors of the point in the fixed image and all pixels in the moving image. Second, we eliminate most incorrectly detected point correspondences (outliers) by enforcing an inverse consistency constraint, ensuring that correspondences are consistent in both forward and backward directions. We further remove outliers with large distances between corresponding points using a global transformation based outlier detector. Finally, we implement a two-stage registration framework to handle large deformations. The first stage estimates a homography transformation to achieve global alignment between the images, while the second stage uses a third-order polynomial transformation to estimate local deformations. We evaluated RetinaRegNet on three retinal image registration datasets: color fundus images, fluorescein angiography images, and laser speckle flowgraphy images. Our model consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. The accurate registration achieved by RetinaRegNet enables the tracking of eye disease progression, enhances surgical planning, and facilitates the evaluation of treatment efficacy. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/RetinaRegNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Low-Dimensional Subspaces in Diffusion Models for Controllable Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02374v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models. Despite their success, there is still limited understanding of their semantic spaces. This makes it challenging to achieve precise and disentangled image generation without additional training, especially in an unsupervised way. In this work, we improve the understanding of their semantic spaces from intriguing observations: among a certain range of noise levels, (1) the learned posterior mean predictor (PMP) in the diffusion model is locally linear, and (2) the singular vectors of its Jacobian lie in low-dimensional semantic subspaces. We provide a solid theoretical basis to justify the linearity and low-rankness in the PMP. These insights allow us to propose an unsupervised, single-step, training-free LOw-rank COntrollable image editing (LOCO Edit) method for precise local editing in diffusion models. LOCO Edit identified editing directions with nice properties: homogeneity, transferability, composability, and linearity. These properties of LOCO Edit benefit greatly from the low-dimensional semantic subspace. Our method can further be extended to unsupervised or text-supervised editing in various text-to-image diffusion models (T-LOCO Edit). Finally, extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LOCO Edit. The codes will be released at https://github.com/ChicyChen/LOCO-Edit.</p></details> |  |

To reduce this burden, supervised machine-learning approaches have been adopted using large-scale annotated datasets for histopathological image analysis. However, in several scenarios, the availability of large-scale annotated data is a bottleneck while training such models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an alternative paradigm that provides some respite by constructing models utilizing only the unannotated data which is often abundant. The basic idea of SSL is to train a network to perform one or many pseudo or pretext tasks on unannotated data and use it subsequently as the basis for a variety of downstream tasks. It is seen that the success of SSL depends critically on the considered pretext task. While there have been many efforts in designing pretext tasks for classification problems, there haven't been many attempts on SSL for histopathological segmentation. Motivated by this, we propose an SSL approach for segmenting histopathological images via generative diffusion models in this paper. Our method is based on the observation that diffusion models effectively solve an image-to-image translation task akin to a segmentation task. Hence, we propose generative diffusion as the pretext task for histopathological image segmentation. We also propose a multi-loss function-based fine-tuning for the downstream task. We validate our method using several metrics on two publically available datasets along with a newly proposed head and neck (HN) cancer dataset containing hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained images along with annotations.

| **[Generative Hierarchical Materials Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06762v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models trained at scale can now produce text, video, and more recently, scientific data such as crystal structures. In applications of generative approaches to materials science, and in particular to crystal structures, the guidance from the domain expert in the form of high-level instructions can be essential for an automated system to output candidate crystals that are viable for downstream research. In this work, we formulate end-to-end language-to-structure generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose Generative Hierarchical Materials Search (GenMS) for controllable generation of crystal structures. GenMS consists of (1) a language model that takes high-level natural language as input and generates intermediate textual information about a crystal (e.g., chemical formulae), and (2) a diffusion model that takes intermediate information as input and generates low-level continuous value crystal structures. GenMS additionally uses a graph neural network to predict properties (e.g., formation energy) from the generated crystal structures. During inference, GenMS leverages all three components to conduct a forward tree search over the space of possible structures. Experiments show that GenMS outperforms other alternatives of directly using language models to generate structures both in satisfying user request and in generating low-energy structures. We confirm that GenMS is able to generate common crystal structures such as double perovskites, or spinels, solely from natural language input, and hence can form the foundation for more complex structure generation in near future.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://generative-materials.github.io/</p></details> |

Inspired by model pruning which lightens large pre-trained models by removing unimportant parameters, we propose a novel model fine-tuning method to make full use of these ineffective parameters and enable the pre-trained model with new task-specified capabilities. In this work, we first investigate the importance of parameters in pre-trained diffusion models, and discover that the smallest 10% to 20% of parameters by absolute values do not contribute to the generation process. Based on this observation, we propose a method termed SaRA that re-utilizes these temporarily ineffective parameters, equating to optimizing a sparse weight matrix to learn the task-specific knowledge. To mitigate overfitting, we propose a nuclear-norm-based low-rank sparse training scheme for efficient fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a new progressive parameter adjustment strategy to make full use of the re-trained/finetuned parameters. Finally, we propose a novel unstructural backpropagation strategy, which significantly reduces memory costs during fine-tuning. Our method enhances the generative capabilities of pre-trained models in downstream applications and outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods like LoRA in maintaining model's generalization ability. We validate our approach through fine-tuning experiments on SD models, demonstrating significant improvements. SaRA also offers a practical advantage that requires only a single line of code modification for efficient implementation and is seamlessly compatible with existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Param...</summary><p>Parameter efficient finetuning method</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce ParaEVITS, a novel emotional TTS framework that leverages the compositionality of natural language to enhance control over emotional rendering. By incorporating a text-audio encoder inspired by ParaCLAP, a contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) model for computational paralinguistics, the diffusion model is trained to generate emotional embeddings based on textual emotional style descriptions. Our framework first trains on reference audio using the audio encoder, then fine-tunes a diffusion model to process textual inputs from ParaCLAP's text encoder. During inference, speech attributes such as pitch, jitter, and loudness are manipulated using only textual conditioning. Our experiments demonstrate that ParaEVITS effectively control emotion rendering without compromising speech quality. Speech demos are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a generative-discriminative representation distillation approach that combines generative representation with cross-resolution aligned knowledge distillation. This approach facilitates very low-resolution face recognition by jointly distilling generative and discriminative models via two distillation modules. Firstly, the generative representation distillation takes the encoder of a diffusion model pretrained for face super-resolution as the generative teacher to supervise the learning of the student backbone via feature regression, and then freezes the student backbone. After that, the discriminative representation distillation further considers a pretrained face recognizer as the discriminative teacher to supervise the learning of the student head via cross-resolution relational contrastive distillation. In this way, the general backbone representation can be transformed into discriminative head representation, leading to a robust and discriminative student model for very low-resolution face recognition. Our approach improves the recovery of the missing details in very low-resolution faces and achieves better knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on face datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances the recognition accuracy of very low-resolution faces, showcasing its effectiveness and adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[What happens to diffusion model likelihood when your model is conditional?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06364v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models (DMs) iteratively denoise random samples to produce high-quality data. The iterative sampling process is derived from Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), allowing a speed-quality trade-off chosen at inference. Another advantage of sampling with differential equations is exact likelihood computation. These likelihoods have been used to rank unconditional DMs and for out-of-domain classification. Despite the many existing and possible uses of DM likelihoods, the distinct properties captured are unknown, especially in conditional contexts such as Text-To-Image (TTI) or Text-To-Speech synthesis (TTS). Surprisingly, we find that TTS DM likelihoods are agnostic to the text input. TTI likelihood is more expressive but cannot discern confounding prompts. Our results show that applying DMs to conditional tasks reveals inconsistencies and strengthens claims that the properties of DM likelihood are unknown. This impact sheds light on the previously unknown nature of DM likelihoods. Although conditional DMs maximise likelihood, the likelihood in question is not as sensitive to the conditioning input as one expects. This investigation provides a new point-of-view on diffusion likelihoods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffQRCoder: Diffusion-based Aesthetic QR Code Generation with Scanning Robustness Guided Iterative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06355v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the success of Diffusion Models for image generation, the technologies also have revolutionized the aesthetic Quick Response (QR) code generation. Despite significant improvements in visual attractiveness for the beautified codes, their scannabilities are usually sacrificed and thus hinder their practical uses in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel Diffusion-based QR Code generator (DiffQRCoder) to effectively craft both scannable and visually pleasing QR codes. The proposed approach introduces Scanning-Robust Perceptual Guidance (SRPG), a new diffusion guidance for Diffusion Models to guarantee the generated aesthetic codes to obey the ground-truth QR codes while maintaining their attractiveness during the denoising process. Additionally, we present another post-processing technique, Scanning Robust Manifold Projected Gradient Descent (SR-MPGD), to further enhance their scanning robustness through iterative latent space optimization. With extensive experiments, the results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms other compared methods in Scanning Success Rate (SSR) with better or comparable CLIP aesthetic score (CLIP-aes.) but also significantly improves the SSR of the ControlNet-only approach from 60% to 99%. The subjective evaluation indicates that our approach achieves promising visual attractiveness to users as well. Finally, even with different scanning angles and the most rigorous error tolerance settings, our approach robustly achieves over 95% SSR, demonstrating its capability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, EIT reconstruction is hindered by its ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem, which complicates accurate results. To tackle this, we propose Diff-INR, a novel method that combines generative regularization with Implicit Neural Representations (INR) through a diffusion model. Diff-INR introduces geometric priors to guide the reconstruction, effectively addressing the shortcomings of traditional regularization methods. By integrating a pre-trained diffusion regularizer with INR, our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy in both simulation and experimental data. The method demonstrates robust performance across various mesh densities and hyperparameter settings, highlighting its flexibility and efficiency. This advancement represents a significant improvement in managing the ill-posed nature of EIT. Furthermore, the method's principles are applicable to other imaging modalities facing similar challenges with ill-posed inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwiftBrush: One-Step Text-to-Image Diffusion Model with Variational Score Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05239v6)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their ability to generate high-resolution and diverse images from text prompts, text-to-image diffusion models often suffer from slow iterative sampling processes. Model distillation is one of the most effective directions to accelerate these models. However, previous distillation methods fail to retain the generation quality while requiring a significant amount of images for training, either from real data or synthetically generated by the teacher model. In response to this limitation, we present a novel image-free distillation scheme named $\textbf{SwiftBrush}$. Drawing inspiration from text-to-3D synthesis, in which a 3D neural radiance field that aligns with the input prompt can be obtained from a 2D text-to-image diffusion prior via a specialized loss without the use of any 3D data ground-truth, our approach re-purposes that same loss for distilling a pretrained multi-step text-to-image model to a student network that can generate high-fidelity images with just a single inference step. In spite of its simplicity, our model stands as one of the first one-step text-to-image generators that can produce images of comparable quality to Stable Diffusion without reliance on any training image data. Remarkably, SwiftBrush achieves an FID score of $\textbf{16.67}$ and a CLIP score of $\textbf{0.29}$ on the COCO-30K benchmark, achieving competitive results or even substantially surpassing existing state-of-the-art distillation techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024; Github: https://github.com/VinAIResearch/SwiftBrush</p></details> |

While recent efforts have explored deep generative models to address this issue, they often consume substantial computational resources with slow generation speeds while suffering from a lack of realism. To address these limitations, we introduce RangeLDM, a novel approach for rapidly generating high-quality range-view LiDAR point clouds via latent diffusion models. We achieve this by correcting range-view data distribution for accurate projection from point clouds to range images via Hough voting, which has a critical impact on generative learning. We then compress the range images into a latent space with a variational autoencoder, and leverage a diffusion model to enhance expressivity. Additionally, we instruct the model to preserve 3D structural fidelity by devising a range-guided discriminator. Experimental results on KITTI-360 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate both the robust expressiveness and fast speed of our LiDAR point cloud generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source Music Generation with Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06190v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most music generation models directly generate a single music mixture. To allow for more flexible and controllable generation, the Multi-Source Diffusion Model (MSDM) has been proposed to model music as a mixture of multiple instrumental sources (e.g., piano, drums, bass, and guitar). Its goal is to use one single diffusion model to generate consistent music sources, which are further mixed to form the music. Despite its capabilities, MSDM is unable to generate songs with rich melodies and often generates empty sounds. Also, its waveform diffusion introduces significant Gaussian noise artifacts, which compromises audio quality. In response, we introduce a multi-source latent diffusion model (MSLDM) that employs Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode each instrumental source into a distinct latent representation. By training a VAE on all music sources, we efficiently capture each source's unique characteristics in a source latent that our diffusion model models jointly. This approach significantly enhances the total and partial generation of music by leveraging the VAE's latent compression and noise-robustness. The compressed source latent also facilitates more efficient generation. Subjective listening tests and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) scores confirm that our model outperforms MSDM, showcasing its practical and enhanced applicability in music generation systems. We also emphasize that modeling sources is more effective than direct music mixture modeling. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/XZWY/MSLDM.

Yet, the advancement of 3D generative models is hindered by their substantial resource demands for training, along with inefficient, non-compact, and less expressive representations. This paper introduces Make-A-Shape, a new 3D generative model designed for efficient training on a vast scale, capable of utilizing 10 millions publicly-available shapes. Technical-wise, we first innovate a wavelet-tree representation to compactly encode shapes by formulating the subband coefficient filtering scheme to efficiently exploit coefficient relations. We then make the representation generatable by a diffusion model by devising the subband coefficients packing scheme to layout the representation in a low-resolution grid. Further, we derive the subband adaptive training strategy to train our model to effectively learn to generate coarse and detail wavelet coefficients. Last, we extend our framework to be controlled by additional input conditions to enable it to generate shapes from assorted modalities, e.g., single/multi-view images, point clouds, and low-resolution voxels. In our extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate various applications, such as unconditional generation, shape completion, and conditional generation on a wide range of modalities. Our approach not only surpasses the state of the art in delivering high-quality results but also efficiently generates shapes within a few seconds, often achieving this in just 2 seconds for most conditions.

| **[EDADepth: Enhanced Data Augmentation for Monocular Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06183v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their text-to-image synthesis feature, diffusion models have recently seen a rise in visual perception tasks, such as depth estimation. The lack of good-quality datasets makes the extraction of a fine-grain semantic context challenging for the diffusion models. The semantic context with fewer details further worsens the process of creating effective text embeddings that will be used as input for diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a novel EDADepth, an enhanced data augmentation method to estimate monocular depth without using additional training data. We use Swin2SR, a super-resolution model, to enhance the quality of input images. We employ the BEiT pre-trained semantic segmentation model for better extraction of text embeddings. We introduce BLIP-2 tokenizer to generate tokens from these text embeddings. The novelty of our approach is the introduction of Swin2SR, the BEiT model, and the BLIP-2 tokenizer in the diffusion-based pipeline for the monocular depth estimation. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results (SOTA) on the {\delta}3 metric on NYUv2 and KITTI datasets. It also achieves results comparable to those of the SOTA models in the RMSE and REL metrics. Finally, we also show improvements in the visualization of the estimated depth compared to the SOTA diffusion-based monocular depth estimation models.

In this paper, we propose a novel method based on dual diffusion bridges, trained using the CocoChorales Dataset, which consists of unpaired monophonic single-instrument audio data. Each diffusion model is trained on a specific instrument with a Gaussian prior. During inference, a model is designated as the source model to map the input audio to its corresponding Gaussian prior, and another model is designated as the target model to reconstruct the target audio from this Gaussian prior, thereby facilitating timbre transfer. We compare our approach against existing unsupervised timbre transfer models such as VAEGAN and Gaussian Flow Bridges (GFB). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both better Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) and melody preservation, as reflected by lower pitch distances (DPD) compared to VAEGAN and GFB. Additionally, we discover that the noise level from the Gaussian prior, $\sigma$, can be adjusted to control the degree of melody preservation and amount of timbre transferred.</p></details> |  |

This field has seen innovations such as the implementation of specialized loss functions tailored for this task, diverging from the more general approaches in Image-to-Image (I2I) translation. While the concept of Semantic Video Synthesis (SVS)$\unicode{x2013}$the generation of temporally coherent, realistic sequences of images from semantic maps$\unicode{x2013}$is newly formalized in this paper, some existing methods have already explored aspects of this field. Most of these approaches rely on generic loss functions designed for video-to-video translation or require additional data to achieve temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce the SVS-GAN, a framework specifically designed for SVS, featuring a custom architecture and loss functions. Our approach includes a triple-pyramid generator that utilizes SPADE blocks. Additionally, we employ a U-Net-based network for the image discriminator, which performs semantic segmentation for the OASIS loss. Through this combination of tailored architecture and objective engineering, our framework aims to bridge the existing gap between SIS and SVS, outperforming current state-of-the-art models on datasets like Cityscapes and KITTI-360.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion Models have recently shown promising results in HTG but still remain under-explored. We present DiffusionPen (DiffPen), a 5-shot style handwritten text generation approach based on Latent Diffusion Models. By utilizing a hybrid style extractor that combines metric learning and classification, our approach manages to capture both textual and stylistic characteristics of seen and unseen words and styles, generating realistic handwritten samples. Moreover, we explore several variation strategies of the data with multi-style mixtures and noisy embeddings, enhancing the robustness and diversity of the generated data. Extensive experiments using IAM offline handwriting database show that our method outperforms existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively, and its additional generated data can improve the performance of Handwriting Text Recognition (HTR) systems.

To address these shortcomings, we introduce a new framework named ARTIST. This framework incorporates a dedicated textual diffusion model to specifically focus on the learning of text structures. Initially, we pretrain this textual model to capture the intricacies of text representation. Subsequently, we finetune a visual diffusion model, enabling it to assimilate textual structure information from the pretrained textual model. This disentangled architecture design and the training strategy significantly enhance the text rendering ability of the diffusion models for text-rich image generation. Additionally, we leverage the capabilities of pretrained large language models to better interpret user intentions, contributing to improved generation quality. Empirical results on the MARIO-Eval benchmark underscore the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing an improvement of up to 15\% in various metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoDiCast: Conditional Diffusion Model for Weather Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05975v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate weather forecasting is critical for science and society. Yet, existing methods have not managed to simultaneously have the properties of high accuracy, low uncertainty, and high computational efficiency. On one hand, to quantify the uncertainty in weather predictions, the strategy of ensemble forecast (i.e., generating a set of diverse predictions) is often employed. However, traditional ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) is computationally intensive. On the other hand, most existing machine learning-based weather prediction (MLWP) approaches are efficient and accurate. Nevertheless, they are deterministic and cannot capture the uncertainty of weather forecasting. In this work, we propose CoDiCast, a conditional diffusion model to generate accurate global weather prediction, while achieving uncertainty quantification with ensemble forecasts and modest computational cost. The key idea is to simulate a conditional version of the reverse denoising process in diffusion models, which starts from pure Gaussian noise to generate realistic weather scenarios for a future time point. Each denoising step is conditioned on observations from the recent past. Ensemble forecasts are achieved by repeatedly sampling from stochastic Gaussian noise to represent uncertainty quantification. CoDiCast is trained on a decade of ERA5 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several existing data-driven methods in accuracy. Our conditional diffusion model, CoDiCast, can generate 3-day global weather forecasts, at 6-hour steps and $5.625^\circ$ latitude-longitude resolution, for over 5 variables, in about 12 minutes on a commodity A100 GPU machine with 80GB memory. The open-souced code is provided at \url{https://github.com/JimengShi/CoDiCast}.</p></details> |  |

The main limitations of existing editing methods are that they either fail to perform with consistent quality on a wide range of image edits or require time-consuming hyperparameter tuning or fine-tuning of the diffusion model to preserve the image-specific appearance of the input image. We propose a novel approach that is built upon a modified diffusion sampling process via the guidance mechanism. In this work, we explore the self-guidance technique to preserve the overall structure of the input image and its local regions appearance that should not be edited. In particular, we explicitly introduce layout-preserving energy functions that are aimed to save local and global structures of the source image. Additionally, we propose a noise rescaling mechanism that allows to preserve noise distribution by balancing the norms of classifier-free guidance and our proposed guiders during generation. Such a guiding approach does not require fine-tuning the diffusion model and exact inversion process. As a result, the proposed method provides a fast and high-quality editing mechanism. In our experiments, we show through human evaluation and quantitative analysis that the proposed method allows to produce desired editing which is more preferable by humans and also achieves a better trade-off between editing quality and preservation of the original image.

The design of these CDRs determines the antibody's affinity and specificity towards its target. Generative models, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have shown potential to advance the structure-based design of CDR regions. However, only a limited dataset of bound antibody-antigen structures is available, and generalization to out-of-distribution interfaces remains a challenge. Physics based force-fields, which approximate atomic interactions, offer a coarse but universal source of information to better mold designs to target interfaces. Integrating this foundational information into diffusion models is, therefore, highly desirable. Here, we propose a novel approach to enhance the sampling process of diffusion models by integrating force field energy-based feedback. Our model, DiffForce, employs forces to guide the diffusion sampling process, effectively blending the two distributions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method guides the model to sample CDRs with lower energy, enhancing both the structure and sequence of the generated antibodies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Preference-based Linear Bandits via Human Response Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05798v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary human choice feedback is widely used in interactive preference learning for its simplicity, but it provides limited information about preference strength. To overcome this limitation, we leverage human response times, which inversely correlate with preference strength, as complementary information. Our work integrates the EZ-diffusion model, which jointly models human choices and response times, into preference-based linear bandits. We introduce a computationally efficient utility estimator that reformulates the utility estimation problem using both choices and response times as a linear regression problem. Theoretical and empirical comparisons with traditional choice-only estimators reveal that for queries with strong preferences ("easy" queries), choices alone provide limited information, while response times offer valuable complementary information about preference strength. As a result, incorporating response times makes easy queries more useful. We demonstrate this advantage in the fixed-budget best-arm identification problem, with simulations based on three real-world datasets, consistently showing accelerated learning when response times are incorporated.</p></details> |  |

However, when trained on unfiltered internet data, these models can produce unsafe, incorrect, or stylistically undesirable images that are not aligned with human preferences. To address this, recent approaches have incorporated human preference datasets to fine-tune T2I models or to optimize reward functions that capture these preferences. Although effective, these methods are vulnerable to reward hacking, where the model overfits to the reward function, leading to a loss of diversity in the generated images. In this paper, we prove the inevitability of reward hacking and study natural regularization techniques like KL divergence and LoRA scaling, and their limitations for diffusion models. We also introduce Annealed Importance Guidance (AIG), an inference-time regularization inspired by Annealed Importance Sampling, which retains the diversity of the base model while achieving Pareto-Optimal reward-diversity tradeoffs. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of AIG for Stable Diffusion models, striking the optimal balance between reward optimization and image diversity. Furthermore, a user study confirms that AIG improves diversity and quality of generated images across different model architectures and reward functions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), linearly aggregate these parameters which are usually trained on heterogeneous data distributions, potentially overlooking the complex, high-dimensional nature of the parameter space. This can result in degraded performance of the aggregated model. While personalized FL approaches can mitigate the heterogeneous data issue to some extent, the limitation of linear aggregation remains unresolved. To alleviate this issue, we investigate the generative approach of diffusion model and propose a novel generative parameter aggregation framework for personalized FL, \texttt{pFedGPA}. In this framework, we deploy a diffusion model on the server to integrate the diverse parameter distributions and propose a parameter inversion method to efficiently generate a set of personalized parameters for each client. This inversion method transforms the uploaded parameters into a latent code, which is then aggregated through denoising sampling to produce the final personalized parameters. By encoding the dependence of a client's model parameters on the specific data distribution using the high-capacity diffusion model, \texttt{pFedGPA} can effectively decouple the complexity of the overall distribution of all clients' model parameters from the complexity of each individual client's parameter distribution. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method across multiple datasets, surpassing baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlearning or Concealment? A Critical Analysis and Evaluation Metrics for Unlearning in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05668v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has seen significant interest in methods for concept removal and targeted forgetting in diffusion models. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive white-box analysis to expose significant vulnerabilities in existing diffusion model unlearning methods. We show that the objective functions used for unlearning in the existing methods lead to decoupling of the targeted concepts (meant to be forgotten) for the corresponding prompts. This is concealment and not actual unlearning, which was the original goal. The ineffectiveness of current methods stems primarily from their narrow focus on reducing generation probabilities for specific prompt sets, neglecting the diverse modalities of intermediate guidance employed during the inference process. The paper presents a rigorous theoretical and empirical examination of four commonly used techniques for unlearning in diffusion models. We introduce two new evaluation metrics: Concept Retrieval Score (CRS) and Concept Confidence Score (CCS). These metrics are based on a successful adversarial attack setup that can recover forgotten concepts from unlearned diffusion models. The CRS measures the similarity between the latent representations of the unlearned and fully trained models after unlearning. It reports the extent of retrieval of the forgotten concepts with increasing amount of guidance. The CCS quantifies the confidence of the model in assigning the target concept to the manipulated data. It reports the probability of the unlearned model's generations to be aligned with the original domain knowledge with increasing amount of guidance. Evaluating existing unlearning methods with our proposed stringent metrics for diffusion models reveals significant shortcomings in their ability to truly unlearn concepts.

A central problem for learning diffusion policies is to align the policy output with human intents in various tasks. To achieve this, previous methods conduct return-conditioned policy generation or Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based policy optimization, while they both rely on pre-defined reward functions. In this work, we propose a novel framework, Forward KL regularized Preference optimization for aligning Diffusion policies, to align the diffusion policy with preferences directly. We first train a diffusion policy from the offline dataset without considering the preference, and then align the policy to the preference data via direct preference optimization. During the alignment phase, we formulate direct preference learning in a diffusion policy, where the forward KL regularization is employed in preference optimization to avoid generating out-of-distribution actions. We conduct extensive experiments for MetaWorld manipulation and D4RL tasks. The results show our method exhibits superior alignment with preferences and outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

With the same reconstruction quality, the more sufficient the VAE's compression for videos is, the more efficient the LVDMs are. However, most LVDMs utilize 2D image VAE, whose compression for videos is only in the spatial dimension and often ignored in the temporal dimension. How to conduct temporal compression for videos in a VAE to obtain more concise latent representations while promising accurate reconstruction is seldom explored. To fill this gap, we propose an omni-dimension compression VAE, named OD-VAE, which can temporally and spatially compress videos. Although OD-VAE's more sufficient compression brings a great challenge to video reconstruction, it can still achieve high reconstructed accuracy by our fine design. To obtain a better trade-off between video reconstruction quality and compression speed, four variants of OD-VAE are introduced and analyzed. In addition, a novel tail initialization is designed to train OD-VAE more efficiently, and a novel inference strategy is proposed to enable OD-VAE to handle videos of arbitrary length with limited GPU memory. Comprehensive experiments on video reconstruction and LVDM-based video generation demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Open-Sora-Plan</p></details> |
| **[Rolling Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09470v3)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently been increasingly applied to temporal data such as video, fluid mechanics simulations, or climate data. These methods generally treat subsequent frames equally regarding the amount of noise in the diffusion process. This paper explores Rolling Diffusion: a new approach that uses a sliding window denoising process. It ensures that the diffusion process progressively corrupts through time by assigning more noise to frames that appear later in a sequence, reflecting greater uncertainty about the future as the generation process unfolds. Empirically, we show that when the temporal dynamics are complex, Rolling Diffusion is superior to standard diffusion. In particular, this result is demonstrated in a video prediction task using the Kinetics-600 video dataset and in a chaotic fluid dynamics forecasting experiment.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiPrompt: Tuning-free Higher-Resolution Generation with Hierarchical MLLM Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02919v3)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The potential for higher-resolution image generation using pretrained diffusion models is immense, yet these models often struggle with issues of object repetition and structural artifacts especially when scaling to 4K resolution and higher. We figure out that the problem is caused by that, a single prompt for the generation of multiple scales provides insufficient efficacy. In response, we propose HiPrompt, a new tuning-free solution that tackles the above problems by introducing hierarchical prompts. The hierarchical prompts offer both global and local guidance. Specifically, the global guidance comes from the user input that describes the overall content, while the local guidance utilizes patch-wise descriptions from MLLMs to elaborately guide the regional structure and texture generation. Furthermore, during the inverse denoising process, the generated noise is decomposed into low- and high-frequency spatial components. These components are conditioned on multiple prompt levels, including detailed patch-wise descriptions and broader image-level prompts, facilitating prompt-guided denoising under hierarchical semantic guidance. It further allows the generation to focus more on local spatial regions and ensures the generated images maintain coherent local and global semantics, structures, and textures with high definition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art works in higher-resolution image generation, significantly reducing object repetition and enhancing structural quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://liuxinyv.github.io/HiPrompt/</p></details> |

| **[ComAlign: Compositional Alignment in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08206v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have showcased a remarkable ability to extract transferable features for downstream tasks. Nonetheless, the training process of these models is usually based on a coarse-grained contrastive loss between the global embedding of images and texts which may lose the compositional structure of these modalities. Many recent studies have shown VLMs lack compositional understandings like attribute binding and identifying object relationships. Although some recent methods have tried to achieve finer-level alignments, they either are not based on extracting meaningful components of proper granularity or don't properly utilize the modalities' correspondence (especially in image-text pairs with more ingredients). Addressing these limitations, we introduce Compositional Alignment (ComAlign), a fine-grained approach to discover more exact correspondence of text and image components using only the weak supervision in the form of image-text pairs. Our methodology emphasizes that the compositional structure (including entities and relations) extracted from the text modality must also be retained in the image modality. To enforce correspondence of fine-grained concepts in image and text modalities, we train a lightweight network lying on top of existing visual and language encoders using a small dataset. The network is trained to align nodes and edges of the structure across the modalities. Experimental results on various VLMs and datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval and compositional benchmarks, affirming the effectiveness of our plugin model.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Makes a Maze Look Like a Maze?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08202v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unique aspect of human visual understanding is the ability to flexibly interpret abstract concepts: acquiring lifted rules explaining what they symbolize, grounding them across familiar and unfamiliar contexts, and making predictions or reasoning about them. While off-the-shelf vision-language models excel at making literal interpretations of images (e.g., recognizing object categories such as tree branches), they still struggle to make sense of such visual abstractions (e.g., how an arrangement of tree branches may form the walls of a maze). To address this challenge, we introduce Deep Schema Grounding (DSG), a framework that leverages explicit structured representations of visual abstractions for grounding and reasoning. At the core of DSG are schemas--dependency graph descriptions of abstract concepts that decompose them into more primitive-level symbols. DSG uses large language models to extract schemas, then hierarchically grounds concrete to abstract components of the schema onto images with vision-language models. The grounded schema is used to augment visual abstraction understanding. We systematically evaluate DSG and different methods in reasoning on our new Visual Abstractions Dataset, which consists of diverse, real-world images of abstract concepts and corresponding question-answer pairs labeled by humans. We show that DSG significantly improves the abstract visual reasoning performance of vision-language models, and is a step toward human-aligned understanding of visual abstractions.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores whether high-quality visual features alone are sufficient to rival existing state-of-the-art vision-language models. We affirm this by adapting DINOv2 for one-shot and few-shot anomaly detection, with a focus on industrial applications. We show that this approach does not only rival existing techniques but can even outmatch them in many settings. Our proposed vision-only approach, AnomalyDINO, is based on patch similarities and enables both image-level anomaly prediction and pixel-level anomaly segmentation. The approach is methodologically simple and training-free and, thus, does not require any additional data for fine-tuning or meta-learning. Despite its simplicity, AnomalyDINO achieves state-of-the-art results in one- and few-shot anomaly detection (e.g., pushing the one-shot performance on MVTec-AD from an AUROC of 93.1% to 96.6%). The reduced overhead, coupled with its outstanding few-shot performance, makes AnomalyDINO a strong candidate for fast deployment, e.g., in industrial contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboUniView: Visual-Language Model with Unified View Representation for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18977v3)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for robotic manipulation represents a novel paradigm, aiming to enhance the model's ability to generalize to new objects and instructions. However, due to variations in camera specifications and mounting positions, existing methods exhibit significant performance disparities across different robotic platforms. To address this challenge, we propose RoboUniView in this paper, an innovative approach that decouples visual feature extraction from action learning. We first learn a unified view representation from multi-perspective views by pre-training on readily accessible data, and then derive actions from this unified view representation to control robotic manipulation. This unified view representation more accurately mirrors the physical world and is not constrained by the robotic platform's camera parameters. Thanks to this methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the demanding CALVIN benchmark, enhancing the success rate in the $D \to D$ setting from 93.0% to 96.2%, and in the $ABC \to D$ setting from 92.2% to 94.2%. Moreover, our model exhibits outstanding adaptability and flexibility: it maintains high performance under unseen camera parameters, can utilize multiple datasets with varying camera parameters, and is capable of joint cross-task learning across datasets. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/liufanfanlff/RoboUniview</p></details> |  |

Recently, many data science benchmarks have been proposed to investigate their performance in the data science domain. However, existing data science benchmarks still fall short when compared to real-world data science applications due to their simplified settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce DSBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate data science agents with realistic tasks. This benchmark includes 466 data analysis tasks and 74 data modeling tasks, sourced from Eloquence and Kaggle competitions. DSBench offers a realistic setting by encompassing long contexts, multimodal task backgrounds, reasoning with large data files and multi-table structures, and performing end-to-end data modeling tasks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, LVLMs, and agents shows that they struggle with most tasks, with the best agent solving only 34.12% of data analysis tasks and achieving a 34.74% Relative Performance Gap (RPG). These findings underscore the need for further advancements in developing more practical, intelligent, and autonomous data science agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07683v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary image semantic segmentation (OVS) seeks to segment images into semantic regions across an open set of categories. Existing OVS methods commonly depend on foundational vision-language models and utilize similarity computation to tackle OVS tasks. However, these approaches are predominantly tailored to natural images and struggle with the unique characteristics of remote sensing images, such as rapidly changing orientations and significant scale variations. These challenges complicate OVS tasks in earth vision, requiring specialized approaches. To tackle this dilemma, we propose the first OVS framework specifically designed for remote sensing imagery, drawing inspiration from the distinct remote sensing traits. Particularly, to address the varying orientations, we introduce a rotation-aggregative similarity computation module that generates orientation-adaptive similarity maps as initial semantic maps. These maps are subsequently refined at both spatial and categorical levels to produce more accurate semantic maps. Additionally, to manage significant scale changes, we integrate multi-scale image features into the upsampling process, resulting in the final scale-aware semantic masks. To advance OVS in earth vision and encourage reproducible research, we establish the first open-sourced OVS benchmark for remote sensing imagery, including four public remote sensing datasets. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. All codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/caoql98/OVRS.</p></details> |  |
| **[MUMU: Bootstrapping Multimodal Image Generation from Text-to-Image Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18790v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We train a model to generate images from multimodal prompts of interleaved text and images such as "a <picture of a man> man and his <picture of a dog> dog in an <picture of a cartoon> animated style." We bootstrap a multimodal dataset by extracting semantically meaningful image crops corresponding to words in the image captions of synthetically generated and publicly available text-image data. Our model, MUMU, is composed of a vision-language model encoder with a diffusion decoder and is trained on a single 8xH100 GPU node. Despite being only trained on crops from the same image, MUMU learns to compose inputs from different images into a coherent output. For example, an input of a realistic person and a cartoon will output the same person in the cartoon style, and an input of a standing subject and a scooter will output the subject riding the scooter. As a result, our model generalizes to tasks such as style transfer and character consistency. Our results show the promise of using multimodal models as general purpose controllers for image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[$\mathbb{X}$-Sample Contrastive Loss: Improving Contrastive Learning with Sample Similarity Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18134v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning good representations involves capturing the diverse ways in which data samples relate. Contrastive loss - an objective matching related samples - underlies methods from self-supervised to multimodal learning. Contrastive losses, however, can be viewed more broadly as modifying a similarity graph to indicate how samples should relate in the embedding space. This view reveals a shortcoming in contrastive learning: the similarity graph is binary, as only one sample is the related positive sample. Crucially, similarities \textit{across} samples are ignored. Based on this observation, we revise the standard contrastive loss to explicitly encode how a sample relates to others. We experiment with this new objective, called $\mathbb{X}$-Sample Contrastive, to train vision models based on similarities in class or text caption descriptions. Our study spans three scales: ImageNet-1k with 1 million, CC3M with 3 million, and CC12M with 12 million samples. The representations learned via our objective outperform both contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models trained on the same data across a range of tasks. When training on CC12M, we outperform CLIP by $0.6\%$ on both ImageNet and ImageNet Real. Our objective appears to work particularly well in lower-data regimes, with gains over CLIP of $16.8\%$ on ImageNet and $18.1\%$ on ImageNet Real when training with CC3M. Finally, our objective seems to encourage the model to learn representations that separate objects from their attributes and backgrounds, with gains of $3.3$-$5.6$\% over CLIP on ImageNet9. We hope the proposed solution takes a small step towards developing richer learning objectives for understanding sample relations in foundation models.</p></details> |  |

The toolkit aims to provide a user-friendly and comprehensive framework for researchers and developers to evaluate existing multi-modality models and publish reproducible evaluation results. In VLMEvalKit, we implement over 70 different large multi-modality models, including both proprietary APIs and open-source models, as well as more than 20 different multi-modal benchmarks. By implementing a single interface, new models can be easily added to the toolkit, while the toolkit automatically handles the remaining workloads, including data preparation, distributed inference, prediction post-processing, and metric calculation. Although the toolkit is currently mainly used for evaluating large vision-language models, its design is compatible with future updates that incorporate additional modalities, such as audio and video. Based on the evaluation results obtained with the toolkit, we host OpenVLM Leaderboard, a comprehensive leaderboard to track the progress of multi-modality learning research. The toolkit is released at https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit and is actively maintained.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated on 2024.09.12</p></details> |
| **[Securing Vision-Language Models with a Robust Encoder Against Jailbreak and Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07353v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), trained on multimodal big datasets, have significantly advanced AI by excelling in vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly jailbreak attacks, which bypass safety protocols and cause the model to generate misleading or harmful responses. This vulnerability stems from both the inherent susceptibilities of LLMs and the expanded attack surface introduced by the visual modality. We propose Sim-CLIP+, a novel defense mechanism that adversarially fine-tunes the CLIP vision encoder by leveraging a Siamese architecture. This approach maximizes cosine similarity between perturbed and clean samples, facilitating resilience against adversarial manipulations. Sim-CLIP+ offers a plug-and-play solution, allowing seamless integration into existing LVLM architectures as a robust vision encoder. Unlike previous defenses, our method requires no structural modifications to the LVLM and incurs minimal computational overhead. Sim-CLIP+ demonstrates effectiveness against both gradient-based adversarial attacks and various jailbreak techniques. We evaluate Sim-CLIP+ against three distinct jailbreak attack strategies and perform clean evaluations using standard downstream datasets, including COCO for image captioning and OKVQA for visual question answering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sim-CLIP+ maintains high clean accuracy while substantially improving robustness against both gradient-based adversarial attacks and jailbreak techniques. Our code and robust vision encoders are available at https://github.com/speedlab-git/Robust-Encoder-against-Jailbreak-attack.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiniDrive: More Efficient Vision-Language Models with Multi-Level 2D Features as Text Tokens for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07267v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) serve as general-purpose end-to-end models in autonomous driving, performing subtasks such as prediction, planning, and perception through question-and-answer interactions. However, most existing methods rely on computationally expensive visual encoders and large language models (LLMs), making them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios and real-time applications. Meanwhile, most existing VLMs lack the ability to process multiple images, making it difficult to adapt to multi-camera perception in autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called MiniDrive, which incorporates our proposed Feature Engineering Mixture of Experts (FE-MoE) module and Dynamic Instruction Adapter (DI-Adapter). The FE-MoE effectively maps 2D features into visual token embeddings before being input into the language model. The DI-Adapter enables the visual token embeddings to dynamically change with the instruction text embeddings, resolving the issue of static visual token embeddings for the same image in previous approaches. Compared to previous works, MiniDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of parameter size, floating point operations, and response efficiency, with the smallest version containing only 83M parameters.</p></details> |  |

Within the natural domain, the procurement of vision-language datasets to construct these foundation models is facilitated by their abundant availability and the ease of web crawling. Conversely, in the remote sensing domain, although vision-language datasets exist, their volume is suboptimal for constructing robust foundation models. This study introduces an approach to curate vision-language datasets by employing an image decoding machine learning model, negating the need for human-annotated labels. Utilizing this methodology, we amassed approximately 9.6 million vision-language paired datasets in VHR imagery. The resultant model outperformed counterparts that did not leverage publicly available vision-language datasets, particularly in downstream tasks such as zero-shot classification, semantic localization, and image-text retrieval. Moreover, in tasks exclusively employing vision encoders, such as linear probing and k-NN classification, our model demonstrated superior efficacy compared to those relying on domain-specific vision-language datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This study was primarily conducted during the latter half of 2023</p></details> |

Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we approach BIQA from a distortion identification perspective, where our primary goal is to predict distortion types and strengths using Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, due to their extensive knowledge and generalizability. Based on these predicted distortions, we then estimate the quality score of the image. To achieve this, we propose an explainable approach for distortion identification based on attribute learning. Instead of prompting VLMs with the names of distortions, we prompt them with the attributes or effects of distortions and aggregate this information to infer the distortion strength. Additionally, we consider multiple distortions per image, making our method more scalable. To support this, we generate a dataset consisting of 100,000 images for efficient training. Finally, attribute probabilities are retrieved and fed into a regressor to predict the image quality score. The results show that our approach, besides its explainability and transparency, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets in both PLCC and SRCC metrics. Moreover, the zero-shot results demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Vision-Language Tuning: More Information Density, More Generalizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10813v3)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of large pre-trained vision-language models, effectively transferring the knowledge embedded within these foundational models to downstream tasks has become a pivotal topic, particularly in data-scarce environments. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches, especially prompt tuning, have garnered considerable attention. To better understand the nature of prompt tuning, we propose the concept of ``Information Density'' (ID) to indicate whether a matrix strongly belongs to certain feature spaces rather than being evenly distributed across various feature spaces. We suppose a higher ID with strong bias across some feature spaces naturally leads to excellent robustness and stability. Our research, inspired by the observation that generalizability is closely linked to the information density of the prompt matrix, introduces the Dense Information Prompt (DIP). DIP aims to enhance information density to improve generalization. Furthermore, DIP significantly reduces the number of tunable parameters and the requisite storage space, making it particularly advantageous in resource-constrained settings. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the superiority of DIP. Notably, DIP surpasses the latest state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin with an exceptionally small parameter count. Across a range of tasks spanning 11 datasets, DIP improves the average downstream accuracy of classic prompt tuning by up to 5.76% using merely 0.5K parameters.</p></details> |  |

While CLIP and its variants excel in the global alignment of image and text representations, they often struggle to capture the fine-grained details necessary for precise segmentation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that employs patch-level comparison of self-distillation and pixel-level reconstruction losses, enhanced with an attention-based token removal mechanism. This approach selectively retains semantically relevant tokens, enabling the model to focus on the image's critical regions aligned with the specific functions of our model, including textual information processing, patch comparison, and image reconstruction, ensuring that the model learns high-level semantics and detailed visual features. Our experiments demonstrate that DetailCLIP surpasses existing CLIP-based and traditional self-supervised learning (SSL) models in segmentation accuracy and exhibits superior generalization across diverse datasets. DetailCLIP represents a significant advancement in vision-language modeling, offering a robust solution for tasks that demand high-level semantic understanding and detailed feature extraction. https://github.com/KishoreP1/DetailCLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[EXTRACT: Efficient Policy Learning by Extracting Transferable Robot Skills from Offline Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17768v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods focus on learning optimal policies over low-level action spaces. While these methods can perform well in their training environments, they lack the flexibility to transfer to new tasks. Instead, RL agents that can act over useful, temporally extended skills rather than low-level actions can learn new tasks more easily. Prior work in skill-based RL either requires expert supervision to define useful skills, which is hard to scale, or learns a skill-space from offline data with heuristics that limit the adaptability of the skills, making them difficult to transfer during downstream RL. Our approach, EXTRACT, instead utilizes pre-trained vision language models to extract a discrete set of semantically meaningful skills from offline data, each of which is parameterized by continuous arguments, without human supervision. This skill parameterization allows robots to learn new tasks by only needing to learn when to select a specific skill and how to modify its arguments for the specific task. We demonstrate through experiments in sparse-reward, image-based, robot manipulation environments that EXTRACT can more quickly learn new tasks than prior works, with major gains in sample efficiency and performance over prior skill-based RL.

Uncovering LLM's Capabilities in Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09654v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are markedly proficient in deriving visual representations guided by natural language. Recent explorations have utilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by pairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal conditions, referred to as anomaly prompts. However, existing approaches depend on static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and prioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level image-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization. In this paper, we present ALFA, a training-free approach designed to address these challenges via a unified model. We propose a run-time prompt adaptation strategy, which first generates informative anomaly prompts to leverage the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). This strategy is enhanced by a contextual scoring mechanism for per-image anomaly prompt adaptation and cross-semantic ambiguity mitigation. We further introduce a novel fine-grained aligner to fuse local pixel-level semantics for precise anomaly localization, by projecting the image-text alignment from global to local semantic spaces. Extensive evaluations on MVTec and VisA datasets confirm ALFA's effectiveness in harnessing the language potential for zero-shot VAD, achieving significant PRO improvements of 12.1% on MVTec and 8.9% on VisA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MM'24 (Oral)</p></details> |

To push the field forward, multiple 3D Q&A datasets were proposed which, overall, provide a variety of questions, but they individually focus on particular aspects of 3D reasoning or are limited in terms of data modalities. To address this, we present Space3D-Bench - a collection of 1000 general spatial questions and answers related to scenes of the Replica dataset which offers a variety of data modalities: point clouds, posed RGB-D images, navigation meshes and 3D object detections. To ensure that the questions cover a wide range of 3D objectives, we propose an indoor spatial questions taxonomy inspired by geographic information systems and use it to balance the dataset accordingly. Moreover, we provide an assessment system that grades natural language responses based on predefined ground-truth answers by leveraging a Vision Language Model's comprehension of both text and images to compare the responses with ground-truth textual information or relevant visual data. Finally, we introduce a baseline called RAG3D-Chat integrating the world understanding of foundation models with rich context retrieval, achieving an accuracy of 67% on the proposed dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGDA: Multi-agent guideline-driven diagnostic assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06351v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In emergency departments, rural hospitals, or clinics in less developed regions, clinicians often lack fast image analysis by trained radiologists, which can have a detrimental effect on patients' healthcare. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to alleviate some pressure from these clinicians by providing insights that can help them in their decision-making. While these LLMs achieve high test results on medical exams showcasing their great theoretical medical knowledge, they tend not to follow medical guidelines. In this work, we introduce a new approach for zero-shot guideline-driven decision support. We model a system of multiple LLM agents augmented with a contrastive vision-language model that collaborate to reach a patient diagnosis. After providing the agents with simple diagnostic guidelines, they will synthesize prompts and screen the image for findings following these guidelines. Finally, they provide understandable chain-of-thought reasoning for their diagnosis, which is then self-refined to consider inter-dependencies between diseases. As our method is zero-shot, it is adaptable to settings with rare diseases, where training data is limited, but expert-crafted disease descriptions are available. We evaluate our method on two chest X-ray datasets, CheXpert and ChestX-ray 14 Longtail, showcasing performance improvement over existing zero-shot methods and generalizability to rare diseases.</p></details> |  |
| **[INTRA: Interaction Relationship-aware Weakly Supervised Affordance Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06210v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affordance denotes the potential interactions inherent in objects. The perception of affordance can enable intelligent agents to navigate and interact with new environments efficiently. Weakly supervised affordance grounding teaches agents the concept of affordance without costly pixel-level annotations, but with exocentric images. Although recent advances in weakly supervised affordance grounding yielded promising results, there remain challenges including the requirement for paired exocentric and egocentric image dataset, and the complexity in grounding diverse affordances for a single object. To address them, we propose INTeraction Relationship-aware weakly supervised Affordance grounding (INTRA). Unlike prior arts, INTRA recasts this problem as representation learning to identify unique features of interactions through contrastive learning with exocentric images only, eliminating the need for paired datasets. Moreover, we leverage vision-language model embeddings for performing affordance grounding flexibly with any text, designing text-conditioned affordance map generation to reflect interaction relationship for contrastive learning and enhancing robustness with our text synonym augmentation. Our method outperformed prior arts on diverse datasets such as AGD20K, IIT-AFF, CAD and UMD. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate that our method has remarkable domain scalability for synthesized images / illustrations and is capable of performing affordance grounding for novel interactions and objects.</p></details> |  |

| **[Revisiting Prompt Pretraining of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06166v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning is an effective method to customize Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for various downstream tasks, involving tuning very few parameters of input prompt tokens. Recently, prompt pretraining in large-scale dataset (e.g., ImageNet-21K) has played a crucial role in prompt learning for universal visual discrimination. However, we revisit and observe that the limited learnable prompts could face underfitting risks given the extensive images during prompt pretraining, simultaneously leading to poor generalization. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a general framework termed Revisiting Prompt Pretraining (RPP), which targets at improving the fitting and generalization ability from two aspects: prompt structure and prompt supervision. For prompt structure, we break the restriction in common practice where query, key, and value vectors are derived from the shared learnable prompt token. Instead, we introduce unshared individual query, key, and value learnable prompts, thereby enhancing the model's fitting capacity through increased parameter diversity. For prompt supervision, we additionally utilize soft labels derived from zero-shot probability predictions provided by a pretrained Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) teacher model. These soft labels yield more nuanced and general insights into the inter-class relationships, thereby endowing the pretraining process with better generalization ability. RPP produces a more resilient prompt initialization, enhancing its robust transferability across diverse visual recognition tasks. Experiments across various benchmarks consistently confirm the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our pretrained prompts. Codes and models will be made available soon.</p></details> |  |

A core problem in this domain is deciding when to offload a computationally expensive task to the cloud, a remote server, at the cost of communication latency. Task offloading algorithms often rely on precise knowledge of system-specific performance metrics, such as sensor data rates, network bandwidth, and machine learning model latency. While these metrics can be modeled during system design, uncertainties in connection quality, server load, and hardware conditions introduce real-time performance variations, hindering overall performance. We introduce PEERNet, an end-to-end and real-time profiling tool for cloud robotics. PEERNet enables performance monitoring on heterogeneous hardware through targeted yet adaptive profiling of system components such as sensors, networks, deep-learning pipelines, and devices. We showcase PEERNet's capabilities through networked robotics tasks, such as image-based teleoperation of a Franka Emika Panda arm and querying vision language models using an Nvidia Jetson Orin. PEERNet reveals non-intuitive behavior in robotic systems, such as asymmetric network transmission and bimodal language model output. Our evaluation underscores the effectiveness and importance of benchmarking in networked robotics, demonstrating PEERNet's adaptability. Our code is open-source and available at github.com/UTAustin-SwarmLab/PEERNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2024</p></details> |

This work explores a broad range of possibilities to adapt vision-language foundation models at test-time, with a particular emphasis on CLIP and its variants. The study systematically examines prompt-based techniques and existing test-time adaptation methods, aiming to improve the robustness under distribution shift in diverse real-world scenarios. Specifically, the investigation covers various prompt engineering strategies, including handcrafted prompts, prompt ensembles, and prompt learning techniques. Additionally, we introduce a vision-text-space ensemble that substantially enhances average performance compared to text-space-only ensembles. Since online test-time adaptation has shown to be effective to mitigate performance drops under distribution shift, the study extends its scope to evaluate the effectiveness of existing test-time adaptation methods that were originally designed for vision-only classification models. Through extensive experimental evaluations conducted across multiple datasets and diverse model architectures, the research demonstrates the effectiveness of these adaptation strategies.

| **[DexDiff: Towards Extrinsic Dexterity Manipulation of Ungraspable Objects in Unrestricted Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05493v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grasping large and flat objects (e.g. a book or a pan) is often regarded as an ungraspable task, which poses significant challenges due to the unreachable grasping poses. Previous works leverage Extrinsic Dexterity like walls or table edges to grasp such objects. However, they are limited to task-specific policies and lack task planning to find pre-grasp conditions. This makes it difficult to adapt to various environments and extrinsic dexterity constraints. Therefore, we present DexDiff, a robust robotic manipulation method for long-horizon planning with extrinsic dexterity. Specifically, we utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to perceive the environmental state and generate high-level task plans, followed by a goal-conditioned action diffusion (GCAD) model to predict the sequence of low-level actions. This model learns the low-level policy from offline data with the cumulative reward guided by high-level planning as the goal condition, which allows for improved prediction of robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only effectively performs ungraspable tasks but also generalizes to previously unseen objects. It outperforms baselines by a 47% higher success rate in simulation and facilitates efficient deployment and manipulation in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Words to Poses: Enhancing Novel Object Pose Estimation with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05413v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are increasingly envisioned to interact in real-world scenarios, where they must continuously adapt to new situations. To detect and grasp novel objects, zero-shot pose estimators determine poses without prior knowledge. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have shown considerable advances in robotics applications by establishing an understanding between language input and image input. In our work, we take advantage of VLMs zero-shot capabilities and translate this ability to 6D object pose estimation. We propose a novel framework for promptable zero-shot 6D object pose estimation using language embeddings. The idea is to derive a coarse location of an object based on the relevancy map of a language-embedded NeRF reconstruction and to compute the pose estimate with a point cloud registration method. Additionally, we provide an analysis of LERF's suitability for open-set object pose estimation. We examine hyperparameters, such as activation thresholds for relevancy maps and investigate the zero-shot capabilities on an instance- and category-level. Furthermore, we plan to conduct robotic grasping experiments in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00523v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have significantly improved automated task-solving capabilities using autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). However, most LLM-based agents focus on dialogue, programming, or specialized domains, leaving their potential for addressing generative AI safety tasks largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Atlas, an advanced LLM-based multi-agent framework targeting generative AI models, specifically focusing on jailbreak attacks against text-to-image (T2I) models with built-in safety filters. Atlas consists of two agents, namely the mutation agent and the selection agent, each comprising four key modules: a vision-language model (VLM) or LLM brain, planning, memory, and tool usage. The mutation agent uses its VLM brain to determine whether a prompt triggers the T2I model's safety filter. It then collaborates iteratively with the LLM brain of the selection agent to generate new candidate jailbreak prompts with the highest potential to bypass the filter. In addition to multi-agent communication, we leverage in-context learning (ICL) memory mechanisms and the chain-of-thought (COT) approach to learn from past successes and failures, thereby enhancing Atlas's performance. Our evaluation demonstrates that Atlas successfully jailbreaks several state-of-the-art T2I models equipped with multi-modal safety filters in a black-box setting. Additionally, Atlas outperforms existing methods in both query efficiency and the quality of generated images. This work convincingly demonstrates the successful application of LLM-based agents in studying the safety vulnerabilities of popular text-to-image generation models. We urge the community to consider advanced techniques like ours in response to the rapidly evolving text-to-image generation field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shaking Up VLMs: Comparing Transformers and Structured State Space Models for Vision & Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05395v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores replacing Transformers in Visual Language Models (VLMs) with Mamba, a recent structured state space model (SSM) that demonstrates promising performance in sequence modeling. We test models up to 3B parameters under controlled conditions, showing that Mamba-based VLMs outperforms Transformers-based VLMs in captioning, question answering, and reading comprehension. However, we find that Transformers achieve greater performance in visual grounding and the performance gap widens with scale. We explore two hypotheses to explain this phenomenon: 1) the effect of task-agnostic visual encoding on the updates of the hidden states, and 2) the difficulty in performing visual grounding from the perspective of in-context multimodal retrieval. Our results indicate that a task-aware encoding yields minimal performance gains on grounding, however, Transformers significantly outperform Mamba at in-context multimodal retrieval. Overall, Mamba shows promising performance on tasks where the correct output relies on a summary of the image but struggles when retrieval of explicit information from the context is required.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeIn: Telling What You Don't Want](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06481v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negation is a fundamental linguistic concept used by humans to convey information that they do not desire. Despite this, there has been minimal research specifically focused on negation within vision-language tasks. This lack of research means that vision-language models (VLMs) may struggle to understand negation, implying that they struggle to provide accurate results. One barrier to achieving human-level intelligence is the lack of a standard collection by which research into negation can be evaluated. This paper presents the first large-scale dataset, Negative Instruction (NeIn), for studying negation within the vision-language domain. Our dataset comprises 530,694 quadruples, i.e., source image, original caption, negative sentence, and target image in total, including 495,694 queries for training and 35,000 queries for benchmarking across multiple vision-language tasks. Specifically, we automatically generate NeIn based on a large, existing vision-language dataset, MS-COCO, via two steps: generation and filtering. During the generation phase, we leverage two VLMs, BLIP and MagicBrush, to generate the target image and a negative clause that expresses the content of the source image. In the subsequent filtering phase, we apply BLIP to remove erroneous samples. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation protocol for negation understanding of image editing models. Extensive experiments using our dataset across multiple VLMs for instruction-based image editing tasks demonstrate that even recent state-of-the-art VLMs struggle to understand negative queries.

| **[PIP: Detecting Adversarial Examples in Large Vision-Language Models via Attention Patterns of Irrelevant Probe Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05076v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated their powerful multimodal capabilities. However, they also face serious safety problems, as adversaries can induce robustness issues in LVLMs through the use of well-designed adversarial examples. Therefore, LVLMs are in urgent need of detection tools for adversarial examples to prevent incorrect responses. In this work, we first discover that LVLMs exhibit regular attention patterns for clean images when presented with probe questions. We propose an unconventional method named PIP, which utilizes the attention patterns of one randomly selected irrelevant probe question (e.g., "Is there a clock?") to distinguish adversarial examples from clean examples. Regardless of the image to be tested and its corresponding question, PIP only needs to perform one additional inference of the image to be tested and the probe question, and then achieves successful detection of adversarial examples. Even under black-box attacks and open dataset scenarios, our PIP, coupled with a simple SVM, still achieves more than 98% recall and a precision of over 90%. Our PIP is the first attempt to detect adversarial attacks on LVLMs via simple irrelevant probe questions, shedding light on deeper understanding and introspection within LVLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/btzyd/pip.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2024 BNI track (Oral)</p></details> |

Although existing learning-based approaches have been successful, those require annotating videos that come with a considerable labor cost. This paper proposes a learning-free, open-vocabulary approach based on emerging off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLM). The challenge stems from the fact that VLMs are neither designed to process long videos nor tailored for finding actions. We overcome these problems by extending an iterative visual prompting technique. Specifically, we sample video frames into a concatenated image with frame index labels, making a VLM guess a frame that is considered to be closest to the start/end of the action. Iterating this process by narrowing a sampling time window results in finding a specific frame of start and end of an action. We demonstrate that this sampling technique yields reasonable results, illustrating a practical extension of VLMs for understanding videos. A sample code is available at https://microsoft.github.io/VLM-Video-Action-Localization/.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Towards Generative Class Prompt Learning for Fine-grained Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01835v2)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although foundational vision-language models (VLMs) have proven to be very successful for various semantic discrimination tasks, they still struggle to perform faithfully for fine-grained categorization. Moreover, foundational models trained on one domain do not generalize well on a different domain without fine-tuning. We attribute these to the limitations of the VLM's semantic representations and attempt to improve their fine-grained visual awareness using generative modeling. Specifically, we propose two novel methods: Generative Class Prompt Learning (GCPL) and Contrastive Multi-class Prompt Learning (CoMPLe). Utilizing text-to-image diffusion models, GCPL significantly improves the visio-linguistic synergy in class embeddings by conditioning on few-shot exemplars with learnable class prompts. CoMPLe builds on this foundation by introducing a contrastive learning component that encourages inter-class separation during the generative optimization process. Our empirical results demonstrate that such a generative class prompt learning approach substantially outperform existing methods, offering a better alternative to few shot image recognition challenges.

To address this issue, we explore an alternative cheaper source of annotations, single timestamps, for video-text retrieval. We initialise clips from timestamps in a heuristic way to warm up a retrieval model. Then a video clip editing method is proposed to refine the initial rough boundaries to improve retrieval performance. A student-teacher network is introduced for video clip editing. The teacher model is employed to edit the clips in the training set whereas the student model trains on the edited clips. The teacher weights are updated from the student's after the student's performance increases. Our method is model agnostic and applicable to any retrieval models. We conduct experiments based on three state-of-the-art retrieval models, COOT, VideoCLIP and CLIP4Clip. Experiments conducted on three video retrieval datasets, YouCook2, DiDeMo and ActivityNet-Captions show that our edited clips consistently improve retrieval performance over initial clips across all the three retrieval models.</p></details> |  |
| **[POINTS: Improving Your Vision-language Model with Affordable Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04828v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, vision-language models have made significant strides, excelling in tasks like optical character recognition and geometric problem-solving. However, several critical issues remain: 1) Proprietary models often lack transparency about their architectures, while open-source models need more detailed ablations of their training strategies. 2) Pre-training data in open-source works is under-explored, with datasets added empirically, making the process cumbersome. 3) Fine-tuning often focuses on adding datasets, leading to diminishing returns. To address these issues, we propose the following contributions: 1) We trained a robust baseline model using the latest advancements in vision-language models, introducing effective improvements and conducting comprehensive ablation and validation for each technique. 2) Inspired by recent work on large language models, we filtered pre-training data using perplexity, selecting the lowest perplexity data for training. This approach allowed us to train on a curated 1M dataset, achieving competitive performance. 3) During visual instruction tuning, we used model soup on different datasets when adding more datasets yielded marginal improvements. These innovations resulted in a 9B parameter model that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our strategies are efficient and lightweight, making them easily adoptable by the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Outlier Knowledge for Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection with Extensible Local Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04796v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, aiming to distinguish outliers from known categories, has gained prominence in practical scenarios. Recently, the advent of vision-language models (VLM) has heightened interest in enhancing OOD detection for VLM through few-shot tuning. However, existing methods mainly focus on optimizing global prompts, ignoring refined utilization of local information with regard to outliers. Motivated by this, we freeze global prompts and introduce a novel coarse-to-fine tuning paradigm to emphasize regional enhancement with local prompts. Our method comprises two integral components: global prompt guided negative augmentation and local prompt enhanced regional regularization. The former utilizes frozen, coarse global prompts as guiding cues to incorporate negative augmentation, thereby leveraging local outlier knowledge. The latter employs trainable local prompts and a regional regularization to capture local information effectively, aiding in outlier identification. We also propose regional-related metric to empower the enrichment of OOD detection. Moreover, since our approach explores enhancing local prompts only, it can be seamlessly integrated with trained global prompts during inference to boost the performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our method. Notably, our method reduces average FPR95 by 5.17% against state-of-the-art method in 4-shot tuning on challenging ImageNet-1k dataset, even outperforming 16-shot results of previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MuAP: Multi-step Adaptive Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Model with Missing Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04693v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, prompt learning has garnered considerable attention for its success in various Vision-Language (VL) tasks. However, existing prompt-based models are primarily focused on studying prompt generation and prompt strategies with complete modality settings, which does not accurately reflect real-world scenarios where partial modality information may be missing. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into prompt learning behavior when modalities are incomplete, revealing the high sensitivity of prompt-based models to missing modalities. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-step Adaptive Prompt Learning (MuAP) framework, aiming to generate multimodal prompts and perform multi-step prompt tuning, which adaptively learns knowledge by iteratively aligning modalities. Specifically, we generate multimodal prompts for each modality and devise prompt strategies to integrate them into the Transformer model. Subsequently, we sequentially perform prompt tuning from single-stage and alignment-stage, allowing each modality-prompt to be autonomously and adaptively learned, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue caused by only textual prompts that are learnable in previous works. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our MuAP and this model achieves significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art on all benchmark datasets</p></details> |  |

As a challenging task, it requires simultaneous visual data processing and reasoning under ambiguous semantics. Recent solutions are mainly all-in-one models. However, the object detection backbones are pre-trained without text supervision. Thus, to incorporate task requirements, their intricate models undergo extensive learning on a highly imbalanced and scarce dataset, resulting in capped performance, laborious training, and poor generalizability. In contrast, we propose TaskCLIP, a more natural two-stage design composed of general object detection and task-guided object selection. Particularly for the latter, we resort to the recently successful large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as our backbone, which provides rich semantic knowledge and a uniform embedding space for images and texts. Nevertheless, the naive application of VLMs leads to sub-optimal quality, due to the misalignment between embeddings of object images and their visual attributes, which are mainly adjective phrases. To this end, we design a transformer-based aligner after the pre-trained VLMs to re-calibrate both embeddings. Finally, we employ a trainable score function to post-process the VLM matching results for object selection. Experimental results demonstrate that our TaskCLIP outperforms the state-of-the-art DETR-based model TOIST by 3.5% and only requires a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 for both training and inference.</p></details> |  |

Effective problem-solving also necessitates lateral thinking, which remains understudied in AI and has not been used to test visual perception systems. To bridge this gap, we formulate visual lateral thinking as a multiple-choice question-answering task and describe a three-step taxonomy-driven methodology for instantiating task examples. Then, we develop COLUMBUS, a synthetic benchmark that applies the task pipeline to create QA sets with text and icon rebus puzzles based on publicly available collections of compounds and common phrases. COLUMBUS comprises over 1,000 puzzles, each with four answer candidates. While the SotA vision-language models (VLMs) achieve decent performance, our evaluation demonstrates a substantial gap between humans and models. VLMs benefit from human-curated descriptions but struggle to self-generate such representations at the right level of abstraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, submitted to AAAI-25</p></details> |

Automating recovery remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods often rely on human intervention to manually address failures or require exhaustive enumeration of failure cases and the design of specific recovery policies for each scenario, both of which are labor-intensive. Foundational Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which demonstrate remarkable common-sense generalization and reasoning capabilities, have broader, potentially unbounded ODDs. However, limitations in spatial reasoning continue to be a common challenge for many VLMs when applied to robot control and motion-level error recovery. In this paper, we investigate how optimizing visual and text prompts can enhance the spatial reasoning of VLMs, enabling them to function effectively as black-box controllers for both motion-level position correction and task-level recovery from unknown failures. Specifically, the optimizations include identifying key visual elements in visual prompts, highlighting these elements in text prompts for querying, and decomposing the reasoning process for failure detection and control generation. In experiments, prompt optimizations significantly outperform pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models in correcting motion-level position errors and improve accuracy by 65.78% compared to VLMs with unoptimized prompts. Additionally, for task-level failures, optimized prompts enhanced the success rate by 5.8%, 5.8%, and 7.5% in VLMs' abilities to detect failures, analyze issues, and generate recovery plans, respectively, across a wide range of unknown errors in Lego assembly.</p></details> |  |

While considerable efforts have been dedicated to establishing medical foundation models and their zero-shot transfer to downstream tasks, the popular few-shot setting remains relatively unexplored. Following on from the currently strong emergence of this setting in computer vision, we introduce the first structured benchmark for adapting medical vision-language models (VLMs) in a strict few-shot regime and investigate various adaptation strategies commonly used in the context of natural images. Furthermore, we evaluate a simple generalization of the linear-probe adaptation baseline, which seeks an optimal blending of the visual prototypes and text embeddings via learnable class-wise multipliers. Surprisingly, such a text-informed linear probe yields competitive performances in comparison to convoluted prompt-learning and adapter-based strategies, while running considerably faster and accommodating the black-box setting. Our extensive experiments span three different medical modalities and specialized foundation models, nine downstream tasks, and several state-of-the-art few-shot adaptation methods. We made our benchmark and code publicly available to trigger further developments in this emergent subject: \url{https://github.com/FereshteShakeri/few-shot-MedVLMs}.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 (Spotlight) - Code is available at https://github.com/FereshteShakeri/few-shot-MedVLMs.git</p></details> |

Gathering and labeling data to balance out the class label distribution can be both costly and time-consuming. Many existing solutions that enable ensemble learning, re-balancing strategies, or fine-tuning applied to deep neural networks are limited by the inert problem of few class samples across a subset of classes. Recently, vision-language models like CLIP have been observed as effective solutions to zero-shot or few-shot learning by grasping a similarity between vision and language features for image and text pairs. Considering that large pre-trained vision-language models may contain valuable side textual information for minor classes, we propose to leverage text supervision to tackle the challenge of long-tailed learning. Concretely, we propose a novel text-guided mixup technique that takes advantage of the semantic relations between classes recognized by the pre-trained text encoder to help alleviate the long-tailed problem. Our empirical study on benchmark long-tailed tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal with a theoretical guarantee.

| **[Have Large Vision-Language Models Mastered Art History?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03521v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has recently established new baselines in image classification across multiple domains. However, the performance of VLMs in the specific task of artwork classification, particularly art style classification of paintings - a domain traditionally mastered by art historians - has not been explored yet. Artworks pose a unique challenge compared to natural images due to their inherently complex and diverse structures, characterized by variable compositions and styles. Art historians have long studied the unique aspects of artworks, with style prediction being a crucial component of their discipline. This paper investigates whether large VLMs, which integrate visual and textual data, can effectively predict the art historical attributes of paintings. We conduct an in-depth analysis of four VLMs, namely CLIP, LLaVA, OpenFlamingo, and GPT-4o, focusing on zero-shot classification of art style, author and time period using two public benchmarks of artworks. Additionally, we present ArTest, a well-curated test set of artworks, including pivotal paintings studied by art historians.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the potential of prompt engineering in Large Language Models: a comprehensive review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14735v5)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This comprehensive review delves into the pivotal role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), from its inception in the 1950s to the emergence of advanced neural networks and deep learning architectures, has made a breakthrough in LLMs, with models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3, and in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with models such as CLIP and ALIGN. Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, which has emerged as a crucial technique to maximize the utility and accuracy of these models. This paper explores both foundational and advanced methodologies of prompt engineering, including techniques such as self-consistency, chain-of-thought, and generated knowledge, which significantly enhance model performance. Additionally, it examines the prompt method of VLMs through innovative approaches such as Context Optimization (CoOp), Conditional Context Optimization (CoCoOp), and Multimodal Prompt Learning (MaPLe). Critical to this discussion is the aspect of AI security, particularly adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in prompt engineering. Strategies to mitigate these risks and enhance model robustness are thoroughly reviewed. The evaluation of prompt methods is also addressed, through both subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. This review also reflects the essential role of prompt engineering in advancing AI capabilities, providing a structured framework for future research and application.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have sought to transfer knowledge embedded in vision-language models from 2D to 3D domains. However, these approaches often require prior knowledge from specific 3D scene datasets, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot segmentation capabilities, prompting us to investigate its potential for comprehending 3D scenes without training. In this paper, we introduce OV-SAM3D, a training-free method that contains a universal framework for understanding open-vocabulary 3D scenes. This framework is designed to perform understanding tasks for any 3D scene without requiring prior knowledge of the scene. Specifically, our method is composed of two key sub-modules: First, we initiate the process by generating superpoints as the initial 3D prompts and refine these prompts using segment masks derived from SAM. Moreover, we then integrate a specially designed overlapping score table with open tags from the Recognize Anything Model (RAM) to produce final 3D instances with open-world labels. Empirical evaluations on the ScanNet200 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing open-vocabulary methods in unknown open-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hithqd.github.io/projects/OV-SAM3D</p></details> |

A Benchmark Towards Reliable AGI for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02914v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently garnered significant attention, with many efforts aimed at harnessing their general knowledge to enhance the interpretability and robustness of autonomous driving models. However, LVLMs typically rely on large, general-purpose datasets and lack the specialized expertise required for professional and safe driving. Existing vision-language driving datasets focus primarily on scene understanding and decision-making, without providing explicit guidance on traffic rules and driving skills, which are critical aspects directly related to driving safety. To bridge this gap, we propose IDKB, a large-scale dataset containing over one million data items collected from various countries, including driving handbooks, theory test data, and simulated road test data. Much like the process of obtaining a driver's license, IDKB encompasses nearly all the explicit knowledge needed for driving from theory to practice. In particular, we conducted comprehensive tests on 15 LVLMs using IDKB to assess their reliability in the context of autonomous driving and provided extensive analysis. We also fine-tuned popular models, achieving notable performance improvements, which further validate the significance of our dataset.

| **[Benchmarking Spurious Bias in Few-Shot Image Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02882v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot image classifiers are designed to recognize and classify new data with minimal supervision and limited data but often show reliance on spurious correlations between classes and spurious attributes, known as spurious bias. Spurious correlations commonly hold in certain samples and few-shot classifiers can suffer from spurious bias induced from them. There is an absence of an automatic benchmarking system to assess the robustness of few-shot classifiers against spurious bias. In this paper, we propose a systematic and rigorous benchmark framework, termed FewSTAB, to fairly demonstrate and quantify varied degrees of robustness of few-shot classifiers to spurious bias. FewSTAB creates few-shot evaluation tasks with biased attributes so that using them for predictions can demonstrate poor performance. To construct these tasks, we propose attribute-based sample selection strategies based on a pre-trained vision-language model, eliminating the need for manual dataset curation. This allows FewSTAB to automatically benchmark spurious bias using any existing test data. FewSTAB offers evaluation results in a new dimension along with a new design guideline for building robust classifiers. Moreover, it can benchmark spurious bias in varied degrees and enable designs for varied degrees of robustness. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on ten few-shot learning methods across three datasets. We hope our framework can inspire new designs of robust few-shot classifiers.

| **[When Does Visual Prompting Outperform Linear Probing for Vision-Language Models? A Likelihood Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01821v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting pre-trained models to new tasks can exhibit varying effectiveness across datasets. Visual prompting, a state-of-the-art parameter-efficient transfer learning method, can significantly improve the performance of out-of-distribution tasks. On the other hand, linear probing, a standard transfer learning method, can sometimes become the best approach. We propose a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) approach to analyze the comparative benefits of visual prompting and linear probing. By employing the LLR score alongside resource-efficient visual prompts approximations, our cost-effective measure attains up to a 100-fold reduction in run time compared to full training, while achieving prediction accuracies up to 91%.

| **[Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Reprogramming Visual-Language Model for General Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02664v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of deepfake faces poses huge potential negative impacts on our daily lives. Despite substantial advancements in deepfake detection over these years, the generalizability of existing methods against forgeries from unseen datasets or created by emerging generative models remains constrained. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot advantages of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose a novel approach that repurposes a well-trained VLM for general deepfake detection. Motivated by the model reprogramming paradigm that manipulates the model prediction via data perturbations, our method can reprogram a pretrained VLM model (e.g., CLIP) solely based on manipulating its input without tuning the inner parameters. Furthermore, we insert a pseudo-word guided by facial identity into the text prompt. Extensive experiments on several popular benchmarks demonstrate that (1) the cross-dataset and cross-manipulation performances of deepfake detection can be significantly and consistently improved (e.g., over 88% AUC in cross-dataset setting from FF++ to WildDeepfake) using a pre-trained CLIP model with our proposed reprogramming method; (2) our superior performances are at less cost of trainable parameters, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Methods: We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions, 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next, we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions), including GPT (3.5, 4, 4o, 4omini), Claude (3, 3.5), Gemini (1.0), Mistral, Llama (2, 3, 3.1), Mixtral, and Phi (3), across different interfaces (web and API), computing environments (cloud and local), and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally, we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline. Results: Among the proprietary models, GPT-4o (73.7%) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0%) achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming the top open-source models: Llama3.1-405b (64%), Llama3.1-70b (58.3%), and Mixtral-8x7b (54.3%). Among the quantized open-source models, the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7%) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2-7b, Llama2--13b, and Gemma2-9b. Notably, VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast, a 10% increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by human-crafted image descriptions. Conclusion: In conclusion, while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning, the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations, encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript Pages: 34, Figures: 7, Tables: 2, Supplementary File Pages: 35, Data Transparency Statement: Code is available at: https://github.com/Sdamirsa/LLM-VLM-in-Gastroenterology .

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://msr3d.github.io/</p></details> |

However, VLMs face significant security challenges, such as jailbreak attacks, where attackers attempt to bypass the model's safety alignment to elicit harmful responses. The threat of jailbreak attacks on VLMs arises from both the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs and the multiple information channels that VLMs process. While various attacks and defenses have been proposed, there is a notable gap in unified and comprehensive evaluations, as each method is evaluated on different dataset and metrics, making it impossible to compare the effectiveness of each method. To address this gap, we introduce \textit{MMJ-Bench}, a unified pipeline for evaluating jailbreak attacks and defense techniques for VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we assess the effectiveness of various attack methods against SoTA VLMs and evaluate the impact of defense mechanisms on both defense effectiveness and model utility for normal tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation contribute to the field by offering a unified and systematic evaluation framework and the first public-available benchmark for VLM jailbreak research. We also demonstrate several insightful findings that highlights directions for future studies.</p></details> |  |

While the recent advancement in vision-language models (VLMs) has offered unprecedented opportunities to solve open-world problems, how to leverage their capabilities to control robots remains a grand challenge. In this paper, we introduce Marking Open-world Keypoint Affordances (MOKA), an approach that employs VLMs to solve robotic manipulation tasks specified by free-form language instructions. Central to our approach is a compact point-based representation of affordance, which bridges the VLM's predictions on observed images and the robot's actions in the physical world. By prompting the pre-trained VLM, our approach utilizes the VLM's commonsense knowledge and concept understanding acquired from broad data sources to predict affordances and generate motions. To facilitate the VLM's reasoning in zero-shot and few-shot manners, we propose a visual prompting technique that annotates marks on images, converting affordance reasoning into a series of visual question-answering problems that are solvable by the VLM. We further explore methods to enhance performance with robot experiences collected by MOKA through in-context learning and policy distillation. We evaluate and analyze MOKA's performance on various table-top manipulation tasks including tool use, deformable body manipulation, and object rearrangement.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we have explored state-of-the-art VLM models for vision-based transportation engineering tasks such as image classification and object detection. The image classification task involves congestion detection and crack identification, whereas, for object detection, helmet violations were identified. We have applied open-source models such as CLIP, BLIP, OWL-ViT, Llava-Next, and closed-source GPT-4o to evaluate the performance of these state-of-the-art VLM models to harness the capabilities of language understanding for vision-based transportation tasks. These tasks were performed by applying zero-shot prompting to the VLM models, as zero-shot prompting involves performing tasks without any training on those tasks. It eliminates the need for annotated datasets or fine-tuning for specific tasks. Though these models gave comparative results with benchmark Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models in the image classification tasks, for object localization tasks, it still needs improvement. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art VLM models highlighting the advantages and limitations of the models, which can be taken as the baseline for future improvement and wide-scale implementation.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel, generalizable methodology to identify preferred image distributions for black-box Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by measuring output consistency across varied input prompts. Applying this to different rendering types of 3D objects, we demonstrate its efficacy across various domains requiring precise interpretation of complex structures, with a focus on Computer-Aided Design (CAD) as an exemplar field. We further refine VLM outputs using in-context learning with human feedback, significantly enhancing explanation quality. To address the lack of benchmarks in specialized domains, we introduce CAD-VQA, a new dataset for evaluating VLMs on CAD-related visual question answering tasks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs on CAD-VQA establishes baseline performance levels, providing a framework for advancing VLM capabilities in complex visual reasoning tasks across various fields requiring expert-level visual interpretation.

For clearness enhancement, we use real-world data, utilizing a dual-step strategy with pseudo-labels assessed by vision-language models and weather prompt learning. For semantic enhancement, we integrate real-world data by adjusting weather conditions in vision-language model descriptions while preserving semantic meaning. Additionally, we introduce an effective training strategy to bootstrap restoration performance.

To bridge the 2D-to-3D gap for representations to support such a capability, existing methods rely on neural fields (NeRFs) via differentiable rendering or point-based projection methods. However, we demonstrate that NeRFs are inappropriate for scene changes due to their implicitness and point-based methods are inaccurate for part localization without rendering-based optimization. To amend these issues, we propose GraspSplats. Using depth supervision and a novel reference feature computation method, GraspSplats generates high-quality scene representations in under 60 seconds. We further validate the advantages of Gaussian-based representation by showing that the explicit and optimized geometry in GraspSplats is sufficient to natively support (1) real-time grasp sampling and (2) dynamic and articulated object manipulation with point trackers. With extensive experiments on a Franka robot, we demonstrate that GraspSplats significantly outperforms existing methods under diverse task settings. In particular, GraspSplats outperforms NeRF-based methods like F3RM and LERF-TOGO, and 2D detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://graspsplats.github.io/</p></details> |

However, current approaches, which decompose large slides into smaller patches, focus solely on inductive classification, i.e., prediction for each patch is made independently of the other patches in the target test data. We extend the capability of these large models by introducing a transductive approach. By using text-based predictions and affinity relationships among patches, our approach leverages the strong zero-shot capabilities of these new VLMs without any additional labels. Our experiments cover four histopathology datasets and five different VLMs. Operating solely in the embedding space (i.e., in a black-box setting), our approach is highly efficient, processing $10^5$ patches in just a few seconds, and shows significant accuracy improvements over inductive zero-shot classification.

Few-shot CLIP is competitive with existing specialized architectures that were trained on the downstream tasks. Recent research demonstrates that the performance of CLIP can be further improved using lightweight adaptation approaches. However, previous methods adapt different modalities of the CLIP model individually, ignoring the interactions and relationships between visual and textual representations. In this work, we propose Multi-Modal Adapter, an approach for Multi-Modal adaptation of CLIP. Specifically, we add a trainable Multi-Head Attention layer that combines text and image features to produce an additive adaptation of both. Multi-Modal Adapter demonstrates improved generalizability, based on its performance on unseen classes compared to existing adaptation methods. We perform additional ablations and investigations to validate and interpret the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Contrary to the traditional \textit{modus operandi} of pre-training followed by fine-tuning, this work leverages the visual-textual alignment within Vision-Language models (\texttt{VLMs}) to facilitate the unsupervised learning. Specifically, we propose \underline{Med}ical \underline{Un}supervised \underline{A}daptation (\texttt{MedUnA}), constituting two-stage training: Adapter Pre-training, and Unsupervised Learning. In the first stage, we use descriptions generated by a Large Language Model (\texttt{LLM}) corresponding to class labels, which are passed through the text encoder \texttt{BioBERT}. The resulting text embeddings are then aligned with the class labels by training a lightweight \texttt{adapter}. We choose \texttt{\texttt{LLMs}} because of their capability to generate detailed, contextually relevant descriptions to obtain enhanced text embeddings. In the second stage, the trained \texttt{adapter} is integrated with the visual encoder of \texttt{MedCLIP}. This stage employs a contrastive entropy-based loss and prompt tuning to align visual embeddings. We incorporate self-entropy minimization into the overall training objective to ensure more confident embeddings, which are crucial for effective unsupervised learning and alignment. We evaluate the performance of \texttt{MedUnA} on three different kinds of data modalities - chest X-rays, eye fundus and skin lesion images. The results demonstrate significant accuracy gain on average compared to the baselines across different datasets, highlighting the efficacy of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains unclear how to formulate the constraints such that they are 1) versatile to diverse tasks, 2) free of manual labeling, and 3) optimizable by off-the-shelf solvers to produce robot actions in real-time. In this work, we introduce Relational Keypoint Constraints (ReKep), a visually-grounded representation for constraints in robotic manipulation. Specifically, ReKep is expressed as Python functions mapping a set of 3D keypoints in the environment to a numerical cost. We demonstrate that by representing a manipulation task as a sequence of Relational Keypoint Constraints, we can employ a hierarchical optimization procedure to solve for robot actions (represented by a sequence of end-effector poses in SE(3)) with a perception-action loop at a real-time frequency. Furthermore, in order to circumvent the need for manual specification of ReKep for each new task, we devise an automated procedure that leverages large vision models and vision-language models to produce ReKep from free-form language instructions and RGB-D observations. We present system implementations on a wheeled single-arm platform and a stationary dual-arm platform that can perform a large variety of manipulation tasks, featuring multi-stage, in-the-wild, bimanual, and reactive behaviors, all without task-specific data or environment models.

Our approach addresses the significant energy consumption and latency challenges inherent in on-device models. Dolphin employs a compact 0.5B parameter decoder to distill extensive contextual information into a memory embedding, substantially reducing the input length for the primary 7B parameter decoder model. Inspired by vision-language models, we repurpose the image embedding projector to encode long textual contexts, effectively treating extended context as a distinct modality. This innovative method enables processing of substantially longer contexts without the typical computational overhead associated with extended input sequences. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a 10-fold improvement in energy efficiency and a 5-fold reduction in latency compared to conventional full-length context processing methods without losing quality of the response. Our work contributes to the development of more sustainable and scalable language models for on-device applications, addressing the critical need for energy-efficient and responsive AI technologies in resource-constrained environments while maintaining the accuracy to understand long contexts. This research has implications for the broader field of natural language processing, particularly in the domain of efficient model design for resource-limited settings. By enabling more sophisticated AI capabilities on edge devices, Dolphin paves the way for advanced language processing in a wide range of applications where computational resources are at a premium.

However, pre-training of Vision Encoder and the integrated training of LLMs with Vision Encoder are mainly conducted using English training data, leaving it uncertain whether LVLMs can completely handle their potential when generating explanations in languages other than English. In addition, multilingual QA benchmarks that create datasets using machine translation have cultural differences and biases, remaining issues for use as evaluation tasks. To address these challenges, this study created an extended dataset in multiple languages without relying on machine translation. This dataset that takes into account nuances and country-specific phrases was then used to evaluate the generation explanation abilities of LVLMs. Furthermore, this study examined whether Instruction-Tuning in resource-rich English improves performance in other languages. Our findings indicate that LVLMs perform worse in languages other than English compared to English. In addition, it was observed that LVLMs struggle to effectively manage the knowledge learned from English data.</p></details> |  |

To our knowledge, this is the first dataset for video ReID under Ground-to-Aerial scenarios. G2A-VReID dataset has the following characteristics: 1) Drastic view changes; 2) Large number of annotated identities; 3) Rich outdoor scenarios; 4) Huge difference in resolution. Additionally, we propose a new benchmark approach for cross-platform ReID by transforming the cross-platform visual alignment problem into visual-semantic alignment through vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) and applying a parameter-efficient Video Set-Level-Adapter module to adapt image-based foundation model to video ReID tasks, termed VSLA-CLIP. Besides, to further reduce the great discrepancy across the platforms, we also devise the platform-bridge prompts for efficient visual feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on all existing video ReID datasets and our proposed G2A-VReID dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

The growing interactions with AIGCs present a new challenge to the data-driven AI community: While AI-generated contents have played a crucial role in a wide range of AI models, the potential hidden risks they introduce have not been thoroughly examined. Beyond human-oriented forgery detection, AI-generated content poses potential issues for AI models originally designed to process natural data. In this study, we underscore the exacerbated hallucination phenomena in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) caused by AI-synthetic images. Remarkably, our findings shed light on a consistent AIGC \textbf{hallucination bias}: the object hallucinations induced by synthetic images are characterized by a greater quantity and a more uniform position distribution, even these synthetic images do not manifest unrealistic or additional relevant visual features compared to natural images. Moreover, our investigations on Q-former and Linear projector reveal that synthetic images may present token deviations after visual projection, thereby amplifying the hallucination bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSMS: Language-guided Scale-aware MedSegmentor for Medical Image Referring Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17347v2)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional medical image segmentation methods have been found inadequate in facilitating physicians with the identification of specific lesions for diagnosis and treatment. Given the utility of text as an instructional format, we introduce a novel task termed Medical Image Referring Segmentation (MIRS), which requires segmenting specified lesions in images based on the given language expressions. Due to the varying object scales in medical images, MIRS demands robust vision-language modeling and comprehensive multi-scale interaction for precise localization and segmentation under linguistic guidance. However, existing medical image segmentation methods fall short in meeting these demands, resulting in insufficient segmentation accuracy. In response, we propose an approach named Language-guided Scale-aware MedSegmentor (LSMS), incorporating two appealing designs: (1)~a Scale-aware Vision-Language Attention module that leverages diverse convolutional kernels to acquire rich visual knowledge and interact closely with linguistic features, thereby enhancing lesion localization capability; (2)~a Full-Scale Decoder that globally models multi-modal features across various scales, capturing complementary information between scales to accurately outline lesion boundaries. Addressing the lack of suitable datasets for MIRS, we constructed a vision-language medical dataset called Reference Hepatic Lesion Segmentation (RefHL-Seg). This dataset comprises 2,283 abdominal CT slices from 231 cases, with corresponding textual annotations and segmentation masks for various liver lesions in images. We validated the performance of LSMS for MIRS and conventional medical image segmentation tasks across various datasets. Our LSMS consistently outperforms on all datasets with lower computational costs. The code and datasets will be released.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Recent research has thus suggested retrieving relevant GUI designs that match a certain text query from screenshot datasets acquired through crowdsourced or automated exploration of GUIs. However, such text-to-GUI retrieval approaches only leverage the textual information of the GUI elements, neglecting visual information such as icons or background images. In addition, retrieved screenshots are not steered by app developers and often lack important app features that require particular input data. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes GUing, a GUI search engine based on a vision-language model called GUIClip, which we trained specifically for the problem of designing app GUIs. For this, we first collected from Google Play app introduction images which usually display the most representative screenshots and are often captioned (i.e.~labeled) by app vendors. Then, we developed an automated pipeline to classify, crop, and extract the captions from these images. This resulted in a large dataset which we share with this paper: including 303k app screenshots, out of which 135k have captions. We used this dataset to train a novel vision-language model, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind in GUI retrieval. We evaluated our approach on various datasets from related work and in manual experiment. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms previous approaches in text-to-GUI retrieval achieving a Recall@10 of up to 0.69 and a HIT@10 of 0.91. We also explored the performance of GUIClip for other GUI tasks including GUI classification and sketch-to-GUI retrieval with encouraging results.</p></details> |  |

However, existing OOD benchmarks in the literature suffer from two main limitations: (1) they often overlook semantic shift as a potential challenge, and (2) their scale is limited compared to the large datasets used to train modern models. To address these gaps, we introduce SOOD-ImageNet, a novel dataset comprising around 1.6M images across 56 classes, designed for common computer vision tasks such as image classification and semantic segmentation under OOD conditions, with a particular focus on the issue of semantic shift. We ensured the necessary scalability and quality by developing an innovative data engine that leverages the capabilities of modern vision-language models, complemented by accurate human checks. Through extensive training and evaluation of various models on SOOD-ImageNet, we showcase its potential to significantly advance OOD research in computer vision.

In this paper, we formulate PAR as a vision-language fusion problem and fully exploit the relations between pedestrian images and attribute labels. Specifically, the attribute phrases are first expanded into sentences, and then the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP is adopted as our backbone for feature embedding of visual images and attribute descriptions. The contrastive learning objective connects the vision and language modalities well in the CLIP-based feature space, and the Transformer layers used in CLIP can capture the long-range relations between pixels. Then, a multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the dual features effectively and feed-forward network is used to predict attributes. To optimize our network efficiently, we propose the region-aware prompt tuning technique to adjust very few parameters (i.e., only the prompt vectors and classification heads) and fix both the pre-trained VL model and multi-modal Transformer. Our proposed PAR algorithm only adjusts 0.75% learnable parameters compared with the fine-tuning strategy. It also achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both standard and zero-shot settings for PAR, including RAPv1, RAPv2, WIDER, PA100K, and PETA-ZS, RAP-ZS datasets.

We find out that the attention computation over visual tokens is of extreme inefficiency in the deep layers of popular LVLMs, suggesting a need for a sparser approach compared to textual data handling. To this end, we introduce FastV, a versatile plug-and-play method designed to optimize computational efficiency by learning adaptive attention patterns in early layers and pruning visual tokens in subsequent ones. Our evaluations demonstrate FastV's ability to dramatically reduce computational costs (e.g., a 45 reduction in FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-13B) without sacrificing performance in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks. The computational efficiency and performance trade-off of FastV are highly customizable and pareto-efficient. It can compress the FLOPs of a 13B-parameter model to achieve a lower budget than that of a 7B-parameter model, while still maintaining superior performance. We believe FastV has practical values for deployment of LVLMs in edge devices and commercial models.

However, they are designated for specific classification or generative tasks, and require model training or finetuning on large-scale datasets with sizeable parameters and tremendous computing, hindering their clinical utility across diverse resource-constrained scenarios in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight framework Med-MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) that tackles both discriminative and generative multimodal medical tasks. The learning of Med-MoE consists of three steps: multimodal medical alignment, instruction tuning and routing, and domain-specific MoE tuning. After aligning multimodal medical images with LLM tokens, we then enable the model for different multimodal medical tasks with instruction tuning, together with a trainable router tailored for expert selection across input modalities. Finally, the model is tuned by integrating the router with multiple domain-specific experts, which are selectively activated and further empowered by meta expert. Comprehensive experiments on both open- and close-end medical question answering (Med-VQA) and image classification tasks across datasets such as VQA-RAD, SLAKE and Path-VQA demonstrate that our model can achieve performance superior to or on par with state-of-the-art baselines, while only requiring approximately 30\%-50\% of activated model parameters. Extensive analysis and ablations corroborate the effectiveness and practical utility of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harmonizing Generalization and Personalization in Federated Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09771v2)** | 2024-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) incorporates large pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLM) into federated learning through prompt tuning. The transferable representations and remarkable generalization capacity of VLM make them highly compatible with the integration of federated learning. Addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning requires personalization, but excessive focus on it across clients could compromise the model's ability to generalize effectively. To preserve the impressive generalization capability of VLM, it is crucial to strike a balance between personalization and generalization in FPL. To tackle this challenge, we proposed Federated Prompt Learning with CLIP Generalization and low-rank Personalization (FedPGP), which employs pre-trained CLIP to provide knowledge-guidance on the global prompt for improved generalization and incorporates a low-rank adaptation term to personalize the global prompt. Further, FedPGP integrates a prompt-wise contrastive loss to achieve knowledge guidance and personalized adaptation simultaneously, enabling a harmonious balance between personalization and generalization in FPL. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to explore base-to-novel generalization in both category-level and domain-level scenarios with heterogeneous data, showing the superiority of FedPGP in balancing generalization and personalization.</p></details> |  |

However, their conventional usage in zero-shot scene classification methods still involves dividing large images into patches and making independent predictions, i.e., inductive inference, thereby limiting their effectiveness by ignoring valuable contextual information. Our approach tackles this issue by utilizing initial predictions based on text prompting and patch affinity relationships from the image encoder to enhance zero-shot capabilities through transductive inference, all without the need for supervision and at a minor computational cost. Experiments on 10 remote sensing datasets with state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over inductive zero-shot classification.

Such tasks are often found on crowdsourcing platforms, where crowdworkers engage in challenging micro-tasks within web-based environments. Building on this idea, we present TurkingBench, a benchmark consisting of tasks presented as web pages with textual instructions and multi-modal contexts. Unlike previous approaches that rely on artificially synthesized web pages, our benchmark uses natural HTML pages originally designed for crowdsourcing workers to perform various annotation tasks. Each task's HTML instructions are instantiated with different values derived from crowdsourcing tasks, creating diverse instances. This benchmark includes 32.2K instances spread across 158 tasks. To support the evaluation of TurkingBench, we have developed a framework that links chatbot responses to actions on web pages (e.g., modifying a text box, selecting a radio button). We assess the performance of cutting-edge private and open-source models, including language-only and vision-language models (such as GPT4 and InternVL), on this benchmark. Our results show that while these models outperform random chance, there is still significant room for improvement. We hope that this benchmark will drive progress in the evaluation and development of web-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[FADE: Few-shot/zero-shot Anomaly Detection Engine using Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00556v1)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic image anomaly detection is important for quality inspection in the manufacturing industry. The usual unsupervised anomaly detection approach is to train a model for each object class using a dataset of normal samples. However, a more realistic problem is zero-/few-shot anomaly detection where zero or only a few normal samples are available. This makes the training of object-specific models challenging. Recently, large foundation vision-language models have shown strong zero-shot performance in various downstream tasks. While these models have learned complex relationships between vision and language, they are not specifically designed for the tasks of anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose the Few-shot/zero-shot Anomaly Detection Engine (FADE) which leverages the vision-language CLIP model and adjusts it for the purpose of industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, we improve language-guided anomaly segmentation 1) by adapting CLIP to extract multi-scale image patch embeddings that are better aligned with language and 2) by automatically generating an ensemble of text prompts related to industrial anomaly detection. 3) We use additional vision-based guidance from the query and reference images to further improve both zero-shot and few-shot anomaly detection. On the MVTec-AD (and VisA) dataset, FADE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in anomaly segmentation with pixel-AUROC of 89.6% (91.5%) in zero-shot and 95.4% (97.5%) in 1-normal-shot.

In this work, we propose ViP, a novel visual symptom-guided prompt learning framework for medical image analysis, which facilitates general knowledge transfer from CLIP. ViP consists of two key components: a visual symptom generator (VSG) and a dual-prompt network. Specifically, VSG aims to extract explicable visual symptoms from pre-trained large language models, while the dual-prompt network utilizes these visual symptoms to guide the training on two learnable prompt modules, i.e., context prompt and merge prompt, which effectively adapts our framework to medical image analysis via large VLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ViP can outperform state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets.</p></details> |  |

While AVs have been deployed in the real-world to some extent, a full-scale deployment requires AVs to robustly navigate through challenges like heavy rain, snow, low lighting, construction zones and GPS signal loss in tunnels. To be able to handle these specific challenges, an AV must reliably recognize the physical attributes of the environment in which it operates. In this paper, we define context recognition as the task of accurately identifying environmental attributes for an AV to appropriately deal with them. Specifically, we define 24 environmental contexts capturing a variety of weather, lighting, traffic and road conditions that an AV must be aware of. Motivated by the need to recognize environmental contexts, we create a context recognition dataset called DrivingContexts with more than 1.6 million context-query pairs relevant for an AV. Since traditional supervised computer vision approaches do not scale well to a variety of contexts, we propose a framework called ContextVLM that uses vision-language models to detect contexts using zero- and few-shot approaches. ContextVLM is capable of reliably detecting relevant driving contexts with an accuracy of more than 95% on our dataset, while running in real-time on a 4GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU on an AV with a latency of 10.5 ms per query.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) 2024</p></details> |

While large Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, deploying them in real-world scenarios necessitates a comparable geometric understanding in visual perception. In this work, we focus on the geometric comprehension of these models; specifically targeting the depths and heights of objects within a scene. Our observations reveal that, although VLMs excel in basic geometric properties perception such as shape and size, they encounter significant challenges in reasoning about the depth and height of objects. To address this, we introduce GeoMeter, a suite of benchmark datasets encompassing Synthetic 2D, Synthetic 3D, and Real-World scenarios to rigorously evaluate these aspects. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art VLMs using these datasets and find that they consistently struggle with both depth and height perception. Our key insights include detailed analyses of the shortcomings in depth and height reasoning capabilities of VLMs and the inherent bias present in these models. This study aims to pave the way for the development of VLMs with enhanced geometric understanding, crucial for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, they still suffer from hallucination problems referring to generating inconsistent outputs with the image content. To mitigate hallucinations, previous studies mainly focus on retraining LVLMs with custom datasets. Although effective, they inherently come with additional computational costs. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, \textbf{MVP}, that aims to reduce hallucinations by making the most of the innate capabilities of the LVLMs via \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew Multi-\textbf{P}ath Reasoning. Specifically, we first devise a multi-view information-seeking strategy to thoroughly perceive the comprehensive information in the image, which enriches the general global information captured by the original vision encoder in LVLMs. Furthermore, during the answer decoding, we observe that the occurrence of hallucinations has a strong correlation with the certainty of the answer tokens. Thus, we propose multi-path reasoning for each information view to quantify and aggregate the certainty scores for each potential answer among multiple decoding paths and finally decide the output answer. By fully grasping the information in the image and carefully considering the certainty of the potential answers when decoding, our MVP can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs.The extensive experiments verify that our proposed MVP significantly mitigates the hallucination problem across four well-known LVLMs. The source code is available at: \url{https://github.com/GasolSun36/MVP}.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

Specifically, our method exploits the superior generalization ability of the 2D vision-language models and proposes the Embeddings Soft-Guidance Stage to utilize it to implicitly align 3D embeddings and text embeddings. Moreover, we introduce the Embeddings Specialization Stage to purify the feature representation with the help of a given scene-level label, specifying a better feature supervised by the corresponding text embedding. Thus, the 3D model is able to gain informative supervisions both from the image embedding and text embedding, leading to competitive segmentation performances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation by using the textual semantic information of text category labels. Moreover, with extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, we present that our 3DSS-VLG is able not only to achieve the state-of-the-art performance on both S3DIS and ScanNet datasets, but also to maintain strong generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

The VLMs, which process image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper, we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing.

Nevertheless, existing 3D visual grounding approaches require a substantial number of bounding box annotations for text queries, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose 3D-VLA, a weakly supervised approach for 3D visual grounding based on Visual Linguistic Alignment. Our 3D-VLA exploits the superior ability of current large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) on aligning the semantics between texts and 2D images, as well as the naturally existing correspondences between 2D images and 3D point clouds, and thus implicitly constructs correspondences between texts and 3D point clouds with no need for fine-grained box annotations in the training procedure. During the inference stage, the learned text-3D correspondence will help us ground the text queries to the 3D target objects even without 2D images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D visual grounding in a weakly supervised manner by involving large scale vision-language models, and extensive experiments on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate that our 3D-VLA achieves comparable and even superior results over the fully supervised methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce an effective method to distill knowledge from an off-the-shelf vision-language model (VLM), demonstrating that it provides novel supervision in addition to those from a conventional vision-only teacher model. Our key technical contribution is the development of a framework that generates novel text supervision and distills free-form text into a vision encoder. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach, termed VLM-KD, across various benchmark datasets, showing that it surpasses several state-of-the-art long-tail visual classifiers. To our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize knowledge distillation with text supervision generated by an off-the-shelf VLM and apply it to vanilla randomly initialized vision encoders.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have highlighted the susceptibility of these Med-VLMs to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their safety and robustness. Randomized smoothing is a well-known technique for turning any classifier into a model that is certifiably robust to adversarial perturbations. However, this approach requires retraining the Med-VLM-based classifier so that it classifies well under Gaussian noise, which is often infeasible in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called PromptSmooth to achieve efficient certified robustness of Med-VLMs by leveraging the concept of prompt learning. Given any pre-trained Med-VLM, PromptSmooth adapts it to handle Gaussian noise by learning textual prompts in a zero-shot or few-shot manner, achieving a delicate balance between accuracy and robustness, while minimizing the computational overhead. Moreover, PromptSmooth requires only a single model to handle multiple noise levels, which substantially reduces the computational cost compared to traditional methods that rely on training a separate model for each noise level. Comprehensive experiments based on three Med-VLMs and across six downstream datasets of various imaging modalities demonstrate the efficacy of PromptSmooth.

| **[Learning to Prompt Your Domain for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03103v5)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has recently become a very efficient transfer learning paradigm for Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) models. Compared with fine-tuning the entire encoder, prompt learning can obtain highly competitive results by optimizing only a small number of parameters, which presents considerably exciting benefits for federated learning applications that prioritizes communication efficiency. However, in this work, we identify that directly transferring prompt learning approaches into federated learning does not yield favorable results since the model often suffers from considerable domain gaps across different clients. To address this issue, we propose ADAPT, a novel domain-aware prompt learning approach that facilitates both intra- and inter-domain prompts across federated participants. The basic idea of ADAPT is that the prompted CLIP should detect the input image's domain correspondence and before making the prediction of its category. Extensive experiments of ADAPT demonstrate its significant efficiency and effectiveness in federated learning. For example, by learning and sharing only 0.08M parameters, our ADAPT attains a 68.4% average accuracy over six domains in the DomainNet dataset, which improves the original CLIP by a large margin of 14.8%.</p></details> |  |

Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately \textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entire training. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, there is still an opportunity to improve the quality, quantity, and diversity of robot demonstration data. Although vision-language models have been shown to automatically generate demonstration data, their utility has been limited to environments with privileged state information, they require hand-designed skills, and are limited to interactions with few object instances. We propose Manipulate-Anything, a scalable automated generation method for real-world robotic manipulation. Unlike prior work, our method can operate in real-world environments without any privileged state information, hand-designed skills, and can manipulate any static object. We evaluate our method using two setups. First, Manipulate-Anything successfully generates trajectories for all 7 real-world and 14 simulation tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods like VoxPoser. Second, Manipulate-Anything's demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations, or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe Manipulate-Anything can be a scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting.

Vision language models (VLMs) are emerging as revolutionary tools with significant potential to influence autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose the DriveGenVLM framework to generate driving videos and use VLMs to understand them. To achieve this, we employ a video generation framework grounded in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) aimed at predicting real-world video sequences. We then explore the adequacy of our generated videos for use in VLMs by employing a pre-trained model known as Efficient In-context Learning on Egocentric Videos (EILEV). The diffusion model is trained with the Waymo open dataset and evaluated using the Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) score to ensure the quality and realism of the generated videos. Corresponding narrations are provided by EILEV for these generated videos, which may be beneficial in the autonomous driving domain. These narrations can enhance traffic scene understanding, aid in navigation, and improve planning capabilities. The integration of video generation with VLMs in the DriveGenVLM framework represents a significant step forward in leveraging advanced AI models to address complex challenges in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Vision-language models fully explore the knowledge of text modality, demonstrating strong zero-shot recognition performance, which is naturally suited for various open-set problems. More recently, some research focuses on fine-tuning such models to downstream tasks. Prompt tuning methods achieved huge improvements by learning context vectors on few-shot data. However, through the evaluation under open-set adaptation setting with the test data including new classes, we find that there exists a dilemma that learned prompts have worse generalization abilities than hand-crafted prompts. In this paper, we consider combining the advantages of both and come up with a test-time prompt tuning approach, which leverages the maximum concept matching (MCM) scores as dynamic weights to generate an input-conditioned prompt for each image during test. Through extensive experiments on 11 different datasets, we show that our proposed method outperforms all comparison methods on average considering both base and new classes.

While these models excel in zero-shot image tasks, their application to zero-shot video action recognition (ZSVAR) remains challenging due to the dynamic and temporal nature of actions. Existing methods for ZS-VAR typically require extensive training on specific datasets, which can be resource-intensive and may introduce domain biases. In this work, we propose Text-Enhanced Action Recognition (TEAR), a simple approach to ZS-VAR that is training-free and does not require the availability of training data or extensive computational resources. Drawing inspiration from recent findings in vision and language literature, we utilize action descriptors for decomposition and contextual information to enhance zero-shot action recognition. Through experiments on UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics-600 datasets, we showcase the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed approach in addressing the challenges of ZS-VAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to ICPR 2024</p></details> |

Here we investigate this gap for challenging images where objects are seen in unusual poses. We find that humans excel at recognizing objects in such poses. In contrast, state-of-the-art deep networks for vision (EfficientNet, SWAG, ViT, SWIN, BEiT, ConvNext) and state-of-the-art large vision-language models (Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5, GPT-4) are systematically brittle on unusual poses, with the exception of Gemini showing excellent robustness in that condition. As we limit image exposure time, human performance degrades to the level of deep networks, suggesting that additional mental processes (requiring additional time) are necessary to identify objects in unusual poses. An analysis of error patterns of humans vs. networks reveals that even time-limited humans are dissimilar to feed-forward deep networks. In conclusion, our comparison reveals that humans and deep networks rely on different mechanisms for recognizing objects in unusual poses. Understanding the nature of the mental processes taking place during extra viewing time may be key to reproduce the robustness of human vision in silico.</p></details> |  |

By utilizing multi-modal large language models (M-LLMs) that support visual prompting, we can extract image features and convert them into textual data, enabling us to utilize efficient sparse retrieval algorithms employed in natural language processing for image retrieval tasks. To assist the LLM in extracting image features, we apply data augmentation techniques for key expansion and analyze the impact with a metric for relevance between images and textual data. We empirically show the superior precision and recall performance of our image retrieval method compared to conventional vision-language model-based methods on the MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, and NUS-WIDE datasets in a keyword-based image retrieval scenario, where keywords serve as search queries. We also demonstrate that the retrieval performance can be improved by iteratively incorporating keywords into search queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024 Workshops: 2nd Workshop on Traditional Computer Vision in the Age of Deep Learning (TradiCV)</p></details> |

We propose a novel approach for few-shot adaptation to unseen tasks that exploits the semantic understanding of task decomposition provided by vision-language models (VLMs). Our method, Policy Adaptation via Language Optimization (PALO), combines a handful of demonstrations of a task with proposed language decompositions sampled from a VLM to quickly enable rapid nonparametric adaptation, avoiding the need for a larger fine-tuning dataset. We evaluate PALO on extensive real-world experiments consisting of challenging unseen, long-horizon robot manipulation tasks. We find that PALO is able of consistently complete long-horizon, multi-tier tasks in the real world, outperforming state of the art pre-trained generalist policies, and methods that have access to the same demonstrations.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |

In contrast, CLIP offers a promising solution by leveraging multimodal learning to improve zero-shot classification performance. However, in the medical domain, lesions can be small and might not be well represented in the embedding space. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the potential of visual prompt engineering to enhance the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in radiology. Leveraging BiomedCLIP, trained on extensive biomedical image-text pairs, we investigate the impact of embedding visual markers directly within radiological images to guide the model's attention to critical regions. Our evaluation on the JSRT dataset, focusing on lung nodule malignancy classification, demonstrates that incorporating visual prompts $\unicode{x2013}$ such as arrows, circles, and contours $\unicode{x2013}$ significantly improves classification metrics including AUROC, AUPRC, F1 score, and accuracy.

A Case Study in Retail](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15626v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most production-level deployments for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks are still build as processing pipelines of independent steps including image pre-processing, object- and text detection, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and (mostly supervised) object classification. However, the recent advances in vision Foundation Models [25] and Vision Language Models (VLMs) [23] raise the question if these custom trained, multi-step approaches can be replaced with pre-trained, single-step VLMs. This paper analyzes the performance and limits of various VLMs in the context of VQA and OCR [5, 9, 12] tasks in a production-level scenario. Using data from the Retail-786k [10] dataset, we investigate the capabilities of pre-trained VLMs to answer detailed questions about advertised products in images. Our study includes two commercial models, GPT-4V [16] and GPT-4o [17], as well as four open-source models: InternVL [5], LLaVA 1.5 [12], LLaVA-NeXT [13], and CogAgent [9]. Our initial results show, that there is in general no big performance gap between open-source and commercial models. However, we observe a strong task dependent variance in VLM performance: while most models are able to answer questions regarding the product brand and price with high accuracy, they completely fail at the same time to correctly identity the specific product name or discount. This indicates the problem of VLMs to solve fine-grained classification tasks as well to model the more abstract concept of discounts.</p></details> |  |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical imaging: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, GMSD, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that the additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

Traditional 3D iterative-based reconstruction methods suffer from both slow speed and high memory consumption. Recently, in computer graphics, the differentiable rendering has made significant progress, particularly with the rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Inspired by these, we introduce differentiable radiation into PAI, developing a novel reconstruction algorithm: the Sliding Ball Adaptive Growth algorithm (SlingBAG) for 3D PAI, which shows ability in high-quality 3D PAI reconstruction both under extremely sparse view and limited view. We established the point cloud dataset in PAI, and used unique differentiable rapid radiator based on the spherical decomposition strategy and the randomly initialized point cloud adaptively optimized according to sparse sensor data. Each point undergoes updates in 3D coordinates, initial pressure, and resolution (denoted by the radius of ball). Points undergo adaptive growth during iterative process, including point destroying, splitting and duplicating along the gradient of their positions, manifesting the sliding ball effect. Finally, our point cloud to voxel grid shader renders the final reconstruction results. Simulation and in vivo experiments demonstrate that our SlingBAG reconstruction result's SNR can be more than 40 dB under extremely sparse view, while the SNR of traditional back-projection algorithm's result is less than 20 dB. Moreover, the result of SlingBAG's structural similarity to the ground truth is significantly higher, with an SSIM value of 95.6%. Notably, our differentiable rapid radiator can conduct forward PA simulation in homogeneous, non-viscous media substantially faster than current methods that numerically simulate the wave propagation, such as k-Wave. The dataset and all code will be open source.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively.

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible to surpass the acoustic diffraction limit by analyzing fluctuations in a set of photoacoustic images obtained under unknown speckle illumination patterns. Here, we purpose an approach to boost reconstruction fidelity and resolution, while reducing the number of acquired images by utilizing a compressed sensing computational reconstruction framework. The approach takes into account prior knowledge of the system response and sparsity of the target structure. We provide proof of principle experiments of the approach and demonstrate that improved performance is obtained when both speckle fluctuations and object priors are used. We numerically study the expected performance as a function of the measurements signal to noise ratio and sample spatial-sparsity. The presented reconstruction framework can be applied to analyze existing photoacoustic experimental datasets containing dynamic fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

SGCode integrates recent prompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through front-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which is free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3) easily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing insights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is available at: http://3.131.141.63:8501/.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Robot Failure Recovery Using Vision-Language Models With Optimized Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03966v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current robot autonomy struggles to operate beyond the assumed Operational Design Domain (ODD), the specific set of conditions and environments in which the system is designed to function, while the real-world is rife with uncertainties that may lead to failures. Automating recovery remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods often rely on human intervention to manually address failures or require exhaustive enumeration of failure cases and the design of specific recovery policies for each scenario, both of which are labor-intensive. Foundational Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which demonstrate remarkable common-sense generalization and reasoning capabilities, have broader, potentially unbounded ODDs. However, limitations in spatial reasoning continue to be a common challenge for many VLMs when applied to robot control and motion-level error recovery. In this paper, we investigate how optimizing visual and text prompts can enhance the spatial reasoning of VLMs, enabling them to function effectively as black-box controllers for both motion-level position correction and task-level recovery from unknown failures. Specifically, the optimizations include identifying key visual elements in visual prompts, highlighting these elements in text prompts for querying, and decomposing the reasoning process for failure detection and control generation. In experiments, prompt optimizations significantly outperform pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models in correcting motion-level position errors and improve accuracy by 65.78% compared to VLMs with unoptimized prompts. Additionally, for task-level failures, optimized prompts enhanced the success rate by 5.8%, 5.8%, and 7.5% in VLMs' abilities to detect failures, analyze issues, and generate recovery plans, respectively, across a wide range of unknown errors in Lego assembly.</p></details> |  |

Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Twice Before Recognizing: Large Multimodal Models for General Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new strategy called think twice before recognizing to improve fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR). Fine-grained TSR in the wild is difficult due to the complex road conditions, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR when data is lacking. Our strategy achieves effective fine-grained TSR by stimulating the multiple-thinking capability of large multimodal models (LMM). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for the LMM. The context descriptions with center coordinate prompt optimization help the LMM to locate the target traffic sign in the original road images containing multiple traffic signs and filter irrelevant answers through the proposed prior traffic sign hypothesis. The characteristic description is based on few-shot in-context learning of template traffic signs, which decreases the cross-domain difference and enhances the fine-grained recognition capability of the LMM. The differential descriptions of similar traffic signs optimize the multimodal thinking capability of the LMM. The proposed method is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art TSR results on all five datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiverseDialogue: A Methodology for Designing Chatbots with Human-Like Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00262v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), which simulate human users, are frequently employed to evaluate chatbots in applications such as tutoring and customer service. Effective evaluation necessitates a high degree of human-like diversity within these simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that conversations generated by GPT-4o mini, when used as simulated human participants, systematically differ from those between actual humans across multiple linguistic features. These features include topic variation, lexical attributes, and both the average behavior and diversity (variance) of the language used. To address these discrepancies, we propose an approach that automatically generates prompts for user simulations by incorporating features derived from real human interactions, such as age, gender, emotional tone, and the topics discussed. We assess our approach using differential language analysis combined with deep linguistic inquiry. Our method of prompt optimization, tailored to target specific linguistic features, shows significant improvements. Specifically, it enhances the human-likeness of LLM chatbot conversations, increasing their linguistic diversity. On average, we observe a 54 percent reduction in the error of average features between human and LLM-generated conversations. This method of constructing chatbot sets with human-like diversity holds great potential for enhancing the evaluation process of user-facing bots.</p></details> |  |

While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |

Existing multimodal fake news detection (MFND) methods can be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are overly dependent on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in QA is often undermined by the vagueness of user questions. To address this issue, we introduce single-round instance-level prompt optimization, referred to as question rewriter. By enhancing the intelligibility of human questions for black-box LLMs, our question rewriter improves the quality of generated answers. The rewriter is optimized using direct preference optimization based on feedback collected from automatic criteria for evaluating generated answers; therefore, its training does not require costly human annotations. The experiments across multiple black-box LLMs and long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. This paper provides a practical framework for training question rewriters and sets a precedent for future explorations in prompt optimization within LFQA tasks.

However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs. In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization (QPO), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM. We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions. Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts. Experiments on various LLM scales and diverse NLP and math tasks demonstrate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of our method in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept Distillation from Strong to Weak Models via Hypotheses-to-Theories Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09365v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-crafting high quality prompts to optimize the performance of language models is a complicated and labor-intensive process. Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

| **[Large Language Models Prompting With Episodic Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07465v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization is essential for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in scenarios of few-shot learning where training examples are incorporated directly into the prompt. Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p></details> |  |

As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |

Here we address the question of how to fine-tune such systems to improve their performance. We cast this as a problem of optimizing the underlying LM weights and the prompting strategies together, and consider a challenging but highly realistic scenario in which we have no gold labels for any intermediate stages in the pipeline. To address this challenge, we evaluate approximate optimization strategies in which we bootstrap training labels for all pipeline stages and use these to optimize the pipeline's prompts and fine-tune its weights alternatingly. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification, we find that simple approaches for optimizing the prompts and weights together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 65% and 5%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks. We will release our new optimizers in DSPy at http://dspy.ai</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios.

FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat.

However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |

The existing research primarily emphasizes the importance of adapting prompts to specific tasks, rather than specific LLMs. However, a good prompt is not solely defined by its wording, but also binds to the nature of the LLM in question. In this work, we first quantitatively demonstrate that different prompts should be adapted to different LLMs to enhance their capabilities across various downstream tasks in NLP. Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively refine prompts for an LLM, leading to significant improvements over various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2023 (Findings)</p></details> |

The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |

Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization.

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |

In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |

This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2024, Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET), which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts, resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4% increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a significant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16743v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace is the New AutoDiff -- Unlocking Efficient Optimization of Computational Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16218v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. We propose an end-to-end optimization framework, Trace, which treats the computational workflow of an AI system as a graph akin to neural networks, based on a generalization of back-propagation. Optimization of computational workflows often involves rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, hyper-parameters, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). Moreover, its computation graph can change dynamically with the inputs and parameters. We frame a new mathematical setup of iterative optimization, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), to capture and abstract these properties so as to design optimizers that work across many domains. In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. Trace is the tool to implement OPTO in practice. Trace has a Python interface that efficiently converts a computational workflow into an OPTO instance using a PyTorch-like interface. Using Trace, we develop a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime that can effectively solve OPTO problems. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We believe that Trace, OptoPrime and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar selection, ES). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO recently receiving more research attention. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and ES techniques, both isolation and combination, on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars consistently improves performance over IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with ES strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe synergy between ES and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar selection as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remains a crucial aspect of APO and deserves greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO.

Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches make light of the importance of high-quality prompt initialization and the identification of effective optimization directions, thus resulting in substantial optimization steps to obtain satisfactory performance. In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> |  |

In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel optimizer that outperforms baselines on five of six diverse LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 12.9% accuracy.

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table (12 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PROMST that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights.

Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[POS: A Prompts Optimization Suite for Augmenting Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00949v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper targets to enhance the diffusion-based text-to-video generation by improving the two input prompts, including the noise and the text. Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptWizard: Task-Aware Agent-driven Prompt Optimization Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18369v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI across diverse domains, showcasing remarkable capabilities. Central to their success is the concept of prompting, which guides model output generation. However, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic, synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. PromptWizard offers several key features and capabilities, including computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, adaptability to scenarios with varying amounts of training data, and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizard's superiority over existing prompt strategies, showcasing its efficacy and scalability in prompt optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |
| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest.

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |

However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p></details> | WWW 2024 Companion |

Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts.

However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference. It demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot question-answering datasets: GSM8K, MultiArith, and AQuA.</p></details> | preprint |

While this approach opens the door to in-context learning of LLMs, it brings the additional computational burden of model inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.</p></details> |  |

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

Our work addresses the inherent limitations of conventional single-prompt learning methods that often lead to overfitting due to the inability to generalize across varying contexts in real-world videos. Recognizing the diversity of camera views, backgrounds, and objects in videos, we propose a multi-prompt learning framework enhanced with optimal transport. This design allows the model to learn a set of diverse prompts for each action, capturing general characteristics more effectively and distributing the representation to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, by employing optimal transport theory, we efficiently align these prompts with action features, optimizing for a comprehensive representation that adapts to the multifaceted nature of video data. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in action localization accuracy and robustness in few-shot settings on the standard challenging datasets of THUMOS-14 and EpicKitchens100, highlighting the efficacy of our multi-prompt optimal transport approach in overcoming the challenges of conventional few-shot TAL methods.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17804v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

One approach is to treat these models as black boxes and use forward passes (Inference APIs) to interact with them. Current research focuses on adapting these black-box models to downstream tasks using gradient-free prompt optimization, but this often involves an expensive process of searching task-specific prompts. Therefore, we are motivated to study black-box language model adaptation without prompt search. Specifically, we introduce a label-enhanced cross-attention network called CrossTune, which models the semantic relatedness between the input text sequence and task-specific label descriptions. Its effectiveness is examined in the context of few-shot text classification. To improve the generalization of CrossTune, we utilize ChatGPT to generate additional training data through in-context learning. A switch mechanism is implemented to exclude low-quality ChatGPT-generated data. Through extensive experiments on seven benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art gradient-free black-box tuning method by 5.7% on average. Even without using ChatGPT-augmented data, CrossTune performs better or comparably than previous black-box tuning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-Coling 2024</p></details> |
| **[BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11273v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image models with 3D representation methods, e.g., Gaussian Splatting (GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts. The project code is available at https://vlislab22.github.io/BrightDreamer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Multi-Role Capabilities of Large Language Models for Open-Domain Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05217v1)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has emerged as a pivotal research spotlight in information systems. Existing methods follow two main paradigms to collect evidence: (1) The \textit{retrieve-then-read} paradigm retrieves pertinent documents from an external corpus; and (2) the \textit{generate-then-read} paradigm employs large language models (LLMs) to generate relevant documents. However, neither can fully address multifaceted requirements for evidence. To this end, we propose LLMQA, a generalized framework that formulates the ODQA process into three basic steps: query expansion, document selection, and answer generation, combining the superiority of both retrieval-based and generation-based evidence. Since LLMs exhibit their excellent capabilities to accomplish various tasks, we instruct LLMs to play multiple roles as generators, rerankers, and evaluators within our framework, integrating them to collaborate in the ODQA process. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt optimization algorithm to refine role-playing prompts and steer LLMs to produce higher-quality evidence and answers. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks (NQ, WebQ, and TriviaQA) demonstrate that LLMQA achieves the best performance in terms of both answer accuracy and evidence quality, showcasing its potential for advancing ODQA research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>TheWe...</summary><p>TheWebConf 2024 (WWW 2024) oral, code repo: https://github.com/EthanLeo-LYX/LLMQA</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce ConstitutionalExperts, a method for learning a prompt consisting of constitutional principles (i.e. rules), given a training dataset. Unlike prior methods that optimize the prompt as a single entity, our method incrementally improves the prompt by surgically editing individual principles. We also show that we can improve overall performance by learning unique prompts for different semantic regions of the training data and using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to route inputs at inference time. We compare our method to other state of the art prompt-optimization techniques across six benchmark datasets. We also investigate whether MoE improves these other techniques. Our results suggest that ConstitutionalExperts outperforms other prompt optimization techniques by 10.9% (F1) and that mixture-of-experts improves all techniques, suggesting its broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Dependent Prompt Evaluation and Optimization with Offline Inverse RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06553v4)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we aim to enhance the arithmetic reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through zero-shot prompt optimization. We identify a previously overlooked objective of query dependency in such optimization and elucidate two ensuing challenges that impede the successful and economical design of prompt optimization techniques. One primary issue is the absence of an effective method to evaluate prompts during inference when the golden answer is unavailable. Concurrently, learning via interactions with the LLMs to navigate the expansive natural language prompting space proves to be resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce Prompt-OIRL, which harnesses offline inverse reinforcement learning to draw insights from offline prompting demonstration data. Such data exists as by-products when diverse prompts are benchmarked on open-accessible datasets. With Prompt-OIRL, the query-dependent prompt optimization objective is achieved by first learning an offline reward model. This model can evaluate any query-prompt pairs without accessing LLMs. Subsequently, a best-of-N strategy is deployed to recommend the optimal prompt. Our experimental evaluations across various LLM scales and arithmetic reasoning datasets underscore both the efficacy and economic viability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02993v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating natural language has aroused a wide interest in developing prompt-based methods to harness the power of black-box LLMs. Existing methodologies usually prioritize a global optimization for finding the global optimum, which however will perform poorly in certain tasks. This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimization (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connecting Large Language Models with Evolutionary Algorithms Yields Powerful Prompt Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08532v2)** | 2024-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10949v2)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and basic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating "positive thinking" into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of "positive thinking" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best "positive thinking" prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A User-Friendly Framework for Generating Model-Preferred Prompts in Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12760v1)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Well-designed prompts have demonstrated the potential to guide text-to-image models in generating amazing images. Although existing prompt engineering methods can provide high-level guidance, it is challenging for novice users to achieve the desired results by manually entering prompts due to a discrepancy between novice-user-input prompts and the model-preferred prompts. To bridge the distribution gap between user input behavior and model training datasets, we first construct a novel Coarse-Fine Granularity Prompts dataset (CFP) and propose a novel User-Friendly Fine-Grained Text Generation framework (UF-FGTG) for automated prompt optimization. For CFP, we construct a novel dataset for text-to-image tasks that combines coarse and fine-grained prompts to facilitate the development of automated prompt generation methods. For UF-FGTG, we propose a novel framework that automatically translates user-input prompts into model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we propose a prompt refiner that continually rewrites prompts to empower users to select results that align with their unique needs. Meanwhile, we integrate image-related loss functions from the text-to-image model into the training process of text generation to generate model-preferred prompts. Additionally, we propose an adaptive feature extraction module to ensure diversity in the generated results. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of generating more visually appealing and diverse images than previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 5% across six quality and aesthetic metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024)</p></details> |
| **[MORL-Prompt: An Empirical Analysis of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Discrete Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11711v1)** | 2024-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RL-based techniques can be used to search for prompts that when fed into a target language model maximize a set of user-specified reward functions. However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we adapt several techniques for multi-objective optimization to RL-based discrete prompt optimization -- two that consider volume of the Pareto reward surface, and another that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We conduct an empirical analysis of these methods on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize volume perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhaseEvo: Towards Unified In-Context Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11347v1)** | 2024-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crafting an ideal prompt for Large Language Models (LLMs) is a challenging task that demands significant resources and expert human input. Existing work treats the optimization of prompt instruction and in-context learning examples as distinct problems, leading to sub-optimal prompt performance. This research addresses this limitation by establishing a unified in-context prompt optimization framework, which aims to achieve joint optimization of the prompt instruction and examples. However, formulating such optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional natural language space introduces challenges in terms of convergence and computational efficiency. To overcome these issues, we present PhaseEvo, an efficient automatic prompt optimization framework that combines the generative capability of LLMs with the global search proficiency of evolution algorithms. Our framework features a multi-phase design incorporating innovative LLM-based mutation operators to enhance search efficiency and accelerate convergence. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our approach across 35 benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that PhaseEvo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods by a large margin whilst maintaining good efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 9 figures, 26 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Rewrite Prompts for Personalized Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00152v2)** | 2024-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facilitated by large language models (LLMs), personalized text generation has become a rapidly growing research direction. Most existing studies focus on designing specialized models for a particular domain, or they require fine-tuning the LLMs to generate personalized text. We consider a typical scenario in which the large language model, which generates personalized output, is frozen and can only be accessed through APIs. Under this constraint, all one can do is to improve the input text (i.e., text prompts) sent to the LLM, a procedure that is usually done manually. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically revise prompts for personalized text generation. The proposed method takes the initial prompts generated by a state-of-the-art, multistage framework for personalized generation and rewrites a few critical components that summarize and synthesize the personal context. The prompt rewriter employs a training paradigm that chains together supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL), where SL reduces the search space of RL and RL facilitates end-to-end training of the rewriter. Using datasets from three representative domains, we demonstrate that the rewritten prompts outperform both the original prompts and the prompts optimized via supervised learning or reinforcement learning alone. In-depth analysis of the rewritten prompts shows that they are not only human readable, but also able to guide manual revision of prompts when there is limited resource to employ reinforcement learning to train the prompt rewriter, or when it is costly to deploy an automatic prompt rewriter for inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |
| **[Intent-based Prompt Calibration: Enhancing prompt optimization with synthetic boundary cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03099v1)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a challenging and important task due to the high sensitivity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the given prompt and the inherent ambiguity of a textual task instruction. Automatic prompt engineering is essential to achieve optimized performance from LLMs. Recent studies have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs to automatically conduct prompt engineering by employing a meta-prompt that incorporates the outcomes of the last trials and proposes an improved prompt. However, this requires a high-quality benchmark to compare different prompts, which is difficult and expensive to acquire in many real-world use cases. In this work, we introduce a new method for automatic prompt engineering, using a calibration process that iteratively refines the prompt to the user intent. During the optimization process, the system jointly generates synthetic data of boundary use cases and optimizes the prompt according to the generated dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with respect to strong proprietary models on real-world tasks such as moderation and generation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a limited number of annotated samples. Furthermore, we validate the advantages of each one of the system's key components. Our system is built in a modular way, facilitating easy adaptation to other tasks. The code is available $\href{https://github.com/Eladlev/AutoPrompt}{here}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models Against Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13954v3)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant ability in various Natural Language Processing tasks. However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on the phrasing of the task prompt, leading to research on automatic prompt optimization using labeled task data. We reveal that these prompt optimization techniques are vulnerable to distribution shifts such as subpopulation shifts, which are common for LLMs in real-world scenarios such as customer reviews analysis. In this light, we propose a new problem of robust prompt optimization for LLMs against distribution shifts, which requires the prompt optimized over the labeled source group can simultaneously generalize to an unlabeled target group. To solve this problem, we propose Generalized Prompt Optimization framework, which incorporates the unlabeled data from the target group into prompt optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with significant performance improvement on the target group and comparable performance on the source group.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 Main |
| **[GLaPE: Gold Label-agnostic Prompt Evaluation and Optimization for Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02408v1)** | 2024-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), their task performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/thunderous77/GLaPE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Good Prompt Optimizers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02101v1)** | 2024-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based Automatic Prompt Optimization, which typically utilizes LLMs as Prompt Optimizers to self-reflect and refine prompts, has shown promising performance in recent studies. Despite the success, the underlying mechanism of this approach remains unexplored, and the true effectiveness of LLMs as Prompt Optimizers requires further validation. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study to uncover the actual mechanism of LLM-based Prompt Optimization. Our findings reveal that the LLM optimizers struggle to identify the true causes of errors during reflection, tending to be biased by their own prior knowledge rather than genuinely reflecting on the errors. Furthermore, even when the reflection is semantically valid, the LLM optimizers often fail to generate appropriate prompts for the target models with a single prompt refinement step, partly due to the unpredictable behaviors of the target models. Based on the observations, we introduce a new "Automatic Behavior Optimization" paradigm, which directly optimizes the target model's behavior in a more controllable manner. We hope our study can inspire new directions for automatic prompt optimization development.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods heavily rely on per-prompt optimization when handling natural language as editing instructions. Due to the lack of labeled human face 3D datasets and effective architectures, the area of human-instructed 3D-aware editing for open-world portraits in an end-to-end manner remains under-explored. To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end diffusion-based framework termed InstructPix2NeRF, which enables instructed 3D-aware portrait editing from a single open-world image with human instructions. At its core lies a conditional latent 3D diffusion process that lifts 2D editing to 3D space by learning the correlation between the paired images' difference and the instructions via triplet data. With the help of our proposed token position randomization strategy, we could even achieve multi-semantic editing through one single pass with the portrait identity well-preserved. Besides, we further propose an identity consistency module that directly modulates the extracted identity signals into our diffusion process, which increases the multi-view 3D identity consistency. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and show its superiority against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively.
