| **[Characterizing control between interacting subsystems with deep Jacobian estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01946v1)** | 2025-07-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.01946v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems, including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we show that the "sensory" area gains greater control over the "cognitive" area over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of interactions among biological subsystems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Towards Foundation Auto-Encoders for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01875v1)** | 2025-07-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.01875v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a novel approach to time-series modeling, inspired by the successes of large pretrained foundation models. We introduce FAE (Foundation Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ACM KDD 2024, MiLeTS 2024 Workshop, August 25, 2024, Barcelona, Spain</p></details> |
| **[Time-Series JEPA for Predictive Remote Control under Capacity-Limited Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04853v2)** | 2025-07-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.04853v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In remote control systems, transmitting large data volumes (e.g., images, video frames) from wireless sensors to remote controllers is challenging when uplink capacity is limited (e.g., RedCap devices or massive wireless sensor networks). Furthermore, controllers often need only information-rich representations of the original data. To address this, we propose a semantic-driven predictive control combined with a channel-aware scheduling to enhance control performance for multiple devices under limited network capacity. At its core, the proposed framework, coined Time-Series Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (TS-JEPA), encodes high-dimensional sensory data into low-dimensional semantic embeddings at the sensor, reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, TS-JEPA enables predictive inference by predicting future embeddings from current ones and predicted commands, which are directly used by a semantic actor model to compute control commands within the embedding space, eliminating the need to reconstruct raw data. To further enhance reliability and communication efficiency, a channel-aware scheduling is integrated to dynamically prioritize device transmissions based on channel conditions and age of information (AoI). Simulations on inverted cart-pole systems show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional control baselines in communication efficiency, control cost, and predictive accuracy. It enables robust and scalable control under limited network capacity compared to traditional scheduling schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-collective Calibrating Strategy for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03176v2)** | 2025-07-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03176v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in time series forecasting. Despite these ongoing developments, the complex dynamics of time series make it challenging to establish the rule of thumb for designing the golden model architecture. In this study, we argue that refining existing advanced models through a universal calibrating strategy can deliver substantial benefits with minimal resource costs, as opposed to elaborating and training a new model from scratch. We first identify a multi-target learning conflict in the calibrating process, which arises when optimizing variables across time steps, leading to the underutilization of the model's learning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose an innovative calibrating strategy called Socket+Plug (SoP). This approach retains an exclusive optimizer and early-stopping monitor for each predicted target within each Plug while keeping the fully trained Socket backbone frozen. The model-agnostic nature of SoP allows it to directly calibrate the performance of any trained deep forecasting models, regardless of their specific architectures. Extensive experiments on various time series benchmarks and a spatio-temporal meteorological ERA5 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SoP, achieving up to a 22% improvement even when employing a simple MLP as the Plug (highlighted in Figure 1). Code is available at https://github.com/hanyuki23/SoP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

When a process generates multiple synchronized signals we are faced with multidimensional time series. In this context a fundamental problem is that of motif mining, where we seek patterns repeating twice with minor variations, spanning some of the dimensions. State of the art exact solutions for this problem run in time quadratic in the length of the input time series. We provide a scalable method to find the top-k motifs in multidimensional time series with probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the results. Our algorithm runs in time subquadratic in the length of the input, and returns the exact solution with probability at least $1-\delta$, where $\delta$ is a user-defined parameter. The algorithm is designed to be adaptive to the input distribution, self-tuning its parameters while respecting user-defined limits on the memory to use. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by an extensive experimental evaluation, showing that our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, extended experimental section, change of algorithm name due to a title clash with another paper published in the same issue</p></details> |
| **[Time Series Representations for Classification Lie Hidden in Pretrained Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08641v2)** | 2025-07-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.08641v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal a new direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/TiViT.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Fourier Series Guided Design of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15377v3)** | 2025-07-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2404.15377v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we apply 1D quantum convolution to address the task of time series forecasting. By encoding multiple points into the quantum circuit to predict subsequent data, each point becomes a feature, transforming the problem into a multidimensional one. Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tunnelling Through Time Series: A Probabilistic Visibility Graph for Local and Global Pattern Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01247v1)** | 2025-07-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.01247v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing availability of high-resolution, long-term time series data has highlighted the need for methods capable of capturing both local and global patterns. To address this, we introduce the Probabilistic Visibility Graph (PVG), a novel approach inspired by the quantum tunnelling phenomenon. The PVG extends the classical Visibility Graph (VG) by introducing probabilistic connections between time points that are obstructed in the VG due to intermediate values. We demonstrate the PVG's effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies through simulations of amplitude-modulated signals and analysis of electrocorticography (ECoG) data under rest and anesthesia conditions. Key results show that the PVG presents distinct network properties between rest and anesthesia, with rest exhibiting stronger small-worldness and scale-free behavior, reflecting a hub-dominated, centralized connectivity structure, compared to anesthesia. These findings highlight the PVG's potential for analyzing complex signals with interacting temporal scales, offering new insights into neural dynamics and other real-world phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-Posterior Consistency for the Bayesian Inference of Metastable System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01868v2)** | 2025-07-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2408.01868v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vast majority of the literature on learning dynamical systems or stochastic processes from time series has focused on stable or ergodic systems, for both Bayesian and frequentist inference procedures. However, most real-world systems are only metastable, that is, the dynamics appear to be stable on some time scale, but are in fact unstable over longer time scales. Consistency of inference for metastable systems may not be possible, but one can ask about metaconsistency: Do inference procedures converge when observations are taken over a large but finite time interval, but diverge on longer time scales? In this paper we introduce, discuss, and quantify metaconsistency in a Bayesian framework. We discuss how metaconsistency can be exploited to efficiently infer a model for a sub-system of a larger system, where inference on the global behavior may require much more data, or there is no theoretical guarantee as to the asymptotic success of inference procedures. We also discuss the relation between metaconsistency and the spectral properties of the model dynamical system in the case of uniformly ergodic and non-ergodic diffusions.</p></details> | 32 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Time Series Foundation Models are Flow Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00945v1)** | 2025-07-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.00945v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the effectiveness of time series foundation models (TSFMs) for crowd flow prediction, focusing on Moirai and TimesFM. Evaluated on three real-world mobility datasets-Bike NYC, Taxi Beijing, and Spanish national OD flows-these models are deployed in a strict zero-shot setting, using only the temporal evolution of each OD flow and no explicit spatial information. Moirai and TimesFM outperform both statistical and deep learning baselines, achieving up to 33% lower RMSE, 39% lower MAE and up to 49% higher CPC compared to state-of-the-art competitors. Our results highlight the practical value of TSFMs for accurate, scalable flow prediction, even in scenarios with limited annotated data or missing spatial context.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2203.07372</p></details> |
| **[LangTime: A Language-Guided Unified Model for Time Series Forecasting with Proximal Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08271v2)** | 2025-07-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.08271v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has shown an increasing interest in utilizing pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for a variety of time series applications. However, there are three main challenges when using LLMs as foundational models for time series forecasting: (1) Cross-domain generalization. (2) Cross-modality alignment. (3) Error accumulation in autoregressive frameworks. To address these challenges, we proposed LangTime, a language-guided unified model for time series forecasting that incorporates cross-domain pre-training with reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning. Specifically, LangTime constructs Temporal Comprehension Prompts (TCPs), which include dataset-wise and channel-wise instructions, to facilitate domain adaptation and condense time series into a single token, enabling LLMs to understand better and align temporal data. To improve autoregressive forecasting, we introduce TimePPO, a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning algorithm. TimePPO mitigates error accumulation by leveraging a multidimensional rewards function tailored for time series and a repeat-based value estimation strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LangTime achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain forecasting performance, while TimePPO fine-tuning effectively enhances the stability and accuracy of autoregressive forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Parametric State Estimation in Circulating Fuel Reactors with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08904v2)** | 2025-07-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.08904v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent developments in data-driven methods have paved the way to new methodologies to provide accurate state reconstruction of engineering systems; nuclear reactors represent particularly challenging applications for this task due to the complexity of the strongly coupled physics involved and the extremely harsh and hostile environments, especially for new technologies such as Generation-IV reactors. Data-driven techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the novel Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to infer the entire state vector (including neutron fluxes, precursors concentrations, temperature, pressure and velocity) of a reactor from three out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. In particular, this work extends the standard architecture to treat parametric time-series data, ensuring the possibility of investigating different accidental scenarios and showing the capabilities of this approach to provide an accurate state estimation in various operating conditions. This paper considers as a test case the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), a Generation-IV reactor concept, characterised by strong coupling between the neutronics and the thermal hydraulics due to the liquid nature of the fuel. The promising results of this work are further strengthened by the possibility of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the state estimation, due to the considerably low training cost. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Analyst: Framework and Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models for Financial Time Series Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00718v1)** | 2025-07-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.00718v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate financial reports from time series data. We propose a framework encompassing prompt engineering, model selection, and evaluation. We introduce an automated highlighting system to categorize information within the generated reports, differentiating between insights derived directly from time series data, stemming from financial reasoning, and those reliant on external knowledge. This approach aids in evaluating the factual grounding and reasoning capabilities of the models. Our experiments, utilizing both data from the real stock market indices and synthetic time series, demonstrate the capability of LLMs to produce coherent and informative financial reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching Time Series to See and Speak: Forecasting with Aligned Visual and Textual Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24124v2)** | 2025-07-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.24124v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs, which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing time series forecasting.

Latest foundational models trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices. We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause with less than 6% value errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[MamNet: A Novel Hybrid Model for Time-Series Forecasting and Frequency Pattern Analysis in Network Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00304v1)** | 2025-06-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.00304v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abnormal fluctuations in network traffic may indicate potential security threats or system failures. Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and anomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic management. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly detection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and frequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term dependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain modeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using Fourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion layer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to detect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and CAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an improvement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex traffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that MamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time scales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and traffic management. Future work could further optimize the model structure by incorporating external network event information, thereby improving the model's adaptability and stability in complex network environments.</p></details> | 16 pages |

General results in structured matrix approximation theory are presented, exploring a two-fold approach. Firstly, a comprehensive examination of generic symmetry-preserving nonlinear time delay embedding is conducted. This involves analyzing time series data sampled from an equivariant system under study. Secondly, sparse least-squares methods are applied to discern approximate representations of the output coupling matrices. These matrices play a critical role in determining the nonlinear autoregressive representation of an equivariant system. The structural characteristics of these matrices are dictated by the set of symmetries inherent in the system. The document outlines prototypical algorithms derived from the described techniques, offering insight into their practical applications. Emphasis is placed on the significant improvement on structured identification precision when compared to classical reservoir computing methods for the simulation of equivariant dynamical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The v...</summary><p>The views expressed in the article do not necessarily represent the views of the National Commission of Banks and Insurance Companies of Honduras</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the existing benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards transparent and data-driven fault detection in manufacturing: A case study on univariate, discrete time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00102v1)** | 2025-06-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.00102v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial, particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in industrial quality control.</p></details> |  |

The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation. We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\"ive physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

The approach generates daily predictions, which are then aggregated into weekly safety assessments to better inform decision making. To ensure the reliability and operational applicability of the forecasts, we apply a sliding-window cross-validation procedure specifically designed for time series data, combined with an evaluation based on aggregated period-level metrics. Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, tree-based models, and neural networks, are trained and systematically compared within this framework. Unlike the other approaches, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network outperforms the other approaches and detects the upcoming high-risk periods with a balanced accuracy of 0.86, confirming the robustness of our methodology and demonstrating that a binary time series model can anticipate these critical periods based on safety inspections. The proposed methodology converts routine safety inspection data into clear weekly risk scores, detecting the periods when accidents are most likely. Decision-makers can integrate these scores into their planning tools to classify inspection priorities, schedule targeted interventions, and funnel resources to the sites or shifts classified as highest risk, stepping in before incidents occur and getting the greatest return on safety investments.</p></details> |  |

However, the solution of predicting specific future time points when anomalies will occur, known as Anomaly Prediction (AP), remains under-explored. Existing methods dealing with time series data fail in AP, focusing only on immediate anomalies or failing to provide precise predictions for future anomalies. To address the AP task, we propose a novel framework called Anomaly to Prompt (A2P), comprised of Anomaly-Aware Forecasting (AAF) and Synthetic Anomaly Prompting (SAP). To enable the forecasting model to forecast abnormal time points, we adopt a strategy to learn the relationships of anomalies. For the robust detection of anomalies, our proposed SAP introduces a learnable Anomaly Prompt Pool (APP) that simulates diverse anomaly patterns using signal adaptive prompt. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of A2P over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to predict future anomalies.

On the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support scalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894 live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with objective network-based QoE estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pp...</summary><p>19 ppages, 13 figures</p></details> |

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adjusting models during inference, but existing methods typically update the full model, increasing memory and compute costs. We propose PETSA, a parameter-efficient method that adapts forecasters at test time by only updating small calibration modules on the input and output. PETSA uses low-rank adapters and dynamic gating to adjust representations without retraining. To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we introduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2) a frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise structural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of various forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive or better performance across all horizons.

Traditional methods often assume that normal data follow a single Gaussian distribution and identify anomalies as deviations from this distribution. {\color{black} However, this simplified assumption fails to capture the diversity and structural complexity of real-world time series, which can lead to misjudgments and reduced detection performance in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new method that combines a neighborhood-driven data augmentation strategy with a multi-manifold representation learning framework.} By incorporating information from local neighborhoods, the augmentation module can simulate contextual variations of normal data, enhancing the model's adaptability to distributional changes. In addition, we design a structure-aware feature learning approach that encourages natural clustering of similar patterns in the feature space while maintaining sufficient distinction between different operational states. Extensive experiments on several public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness, showing strong potential for generalization and real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, accepted by TNNLS</p></details> |
| **[The language of time: a language model perspective on time-series foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00078v1)** | 2025-06-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.00078v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However, this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox, this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation models.</p></details> |  |

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted by IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI 2025)</p></details> |

This not only serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer, preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons recorded via smartphone sensors.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark, results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear path shifts and limited historical observations.</p></details> | Short research paper |

Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$ subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size. To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in prenatal diagnostics.

While anomalies are caused by undesirable changes in the data, differentiating abnormal changes from varying normal behaviours is difficult due to differing frequencies of occurrence, varying time intervals when normal patterns occur, and identifying similarity thresholds to separate the boundary between normal vs. abnormal sequences. Differentiating between concept drift and anomalies is critical for accurate analysis as studies have shown that the compounding effects of error propagation in downstream tasks lead to lower detection accuracy and increased overhead due to unnecessary model updates. Unfortunately, existing work has largely explored anomaly detection and concept drift detection in isolation. We introduce AnDri, a framework for Anomaly detection in the presence of Drift. AnDri introduces the notion of a dynamic normal model where normal patterns are activated, deactivated or newly added, providing flexibility to adapt to concept drift and anomalies over time. We introduce a new clustering method, Adjacent Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), for learning normal patterns that respect their temporal locality; critical for detecting short-lived, but recurring patterns that are overlooked by existing methods. Our evaluation shows AnDri outperforms existing baselines using real datasets with varying types, proportions, and distributions of concept drift and anomalies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (to be updated)</p></details> |

This study utilizes digital cognitive tasks with eye-tracking data correlated with memory processes to distinguish between Healthy Controls (HC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia. A deep learning model based on VTNet was trained using eye-tracking data from 44 participants (24 MCI, 20 HCs) who performed a visual memory task. The model utilizes both time series and spatial data derived from eye-tracking. It was modified to incorporate scan paths, heat maps, and image content. These modifications also enabled testing parameters such as image resolution and task performance, analyzing their impact on model performance. The best model, utilizing $700\times700px$ resolution heatmaps, achieved 68% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Despite operating under more challenging conditions (e.g., smaller dataset size, shorter task duration, or a less standardized task), the model's performance is comparable to an Alzheimer's study using similar methods (70% sensitivity and 73% specificity). These findings contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for MCI. Future work should focus on refining the model and using a standardized long-term visual memory task.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Wearable movement data offers a valuable avenue for exploration, as it's a core feature in nearly all commercial smartwatches, well established in clinical and mental health research, and the sequential nature of the data shares similarities to language. We introduce the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT), the first open source foundation model designed for time-series wearable movement data. Leveraging transformer-based architectures and novel techniques, such as patch embeddings, and pretraining on data from 29,307 participants in a national U.S. sample, PAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in several mental health prediction tasks. PAT is also lightweight and easily interpretable, making it a robust tool for mental health research. GitHub: https://github.com/njacobsonlab/Pretrained-Actigraphy-Transformer/</p></details> |  |

This study explores an anomaly detection approach by simulating vehicle behavior, generating a dataset that represents typical and atypical vehicular interactions. The dataset includes time-series data of position, speed, and acceleration for multiple connected autonomous vehicles. We utilized machine learning models to effectively identify abnormal driving patterns. First, we applied a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture temporal dependencies and sequence-based anomalies. The stacked LSTM model processed the sequential data to learn standard driving behaviors. Additionally, we deployed a Random Forest model to support anomaly detection by offering ensemble-based predictions, which enhanced model interpretability and performance. The Random Forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9830, MAE of 5.746, and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 14.18, while the stacked LSTM model attained an R2 of 0.9998, MAE of 82.425, and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 265.63. These results demonstrate the models' effectiveness in accurately predicting vehicle trajectories and detecting anomalies in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Time Series Multi-Task Question Answering (Time-MQA), a unified framework that enables natural language queries across multiple time series tasks - numerical analytical tasks and open-ended question answering with reasoning. Central to Time-MQA is the TSQA dataset, a large-scale dataset containing $\sim$200k question-answer pairs derived from diverse time series spanning environment, traffic, etc. This comprehensive resource covers various time series lengths and promotes robust model development. We further demonstrate how continually pre-training large language models (Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B) on the TSQA dataset enhanced time series reasoning capabilities, moving beyond mere numeric tasks and enabling more advanced and intuitive interactions with temporal data.

Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements. In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, Eusipco 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework from an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model interpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\ell_0$-norm induced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we reformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization problem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a subspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the search space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated spatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying sparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by developing a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme makes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision variables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the MIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while maintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the time-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover both daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity of human mobility. Second, we demonstrate the spatial patterns of yearly seasonality in climate variable time series such as temperature and precipitation across the past four decades, and our model allows to discover dynamic climate patterns and identify climate phenomena such as El Nino in sea surface temperature.</p></details> |  |

This architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach, the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17 real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR. In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23 popular anomaly detection baselines.

Trajectory enabled Unified Online Detection of Adversarial Examples and Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22722v1)** | 2025-06-28 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.22722v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proposed UniGuard is the first unified online detection framework capable of simultaneously addressing adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. UniGuard builds upon two key insights: first, both AE and backdoor attacks have to compromise the inference phase, making it possible to tackle them simultaneously during run-time via online detection. Second, an adversarial input, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in backdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign sample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference. The propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of its benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be fulfilled. Detecting these trajectory signatures is inherently challenging due to their subtlety; UniGuard overcomes this by treating the propagation trajectory as a time-series signal, leveraging LSTM and spectrum transformation to amplify differences between adversarial and benign trajectories that are subtle in the time domain. UniGuard exceptional efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively validated across various modalities (image, text, and audio) and tasks (classification and regression), ranging from diverse model architectures against a wide range of AE attacks and backdoor attacks, including challenging partial backdoors and dynamic triggers. When compared to SOTA methods, including ContraNet (NDSS 22) specific for AE detection and TED (IEEE SP 24) specific for backdoor detection, UniGuard consistently demonstrates superior performance, even when matched against each method's strengths in addressing their respective threats-each SOTA fails to parts of attack strategies while UniGuard succeeds for all.</p></details> |  |

Such drifts expose the forecasting models to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and machine learning models lack robustness in these settings. Robustness can be improved by using deep generative models or genetic algorithms to augment time series datasets, but these approaches lack interpretability and are computationally expensive. In this work, we develop an interpretable and simple framework for generating time series. Our method combines time-series decompositions with analytic functions, and is able to generate time series with characteristics matching both in- and out-of-distribution data. This approach allows users to generate new time series in an interpretable fashion, which can be used to augment the dataset and improve forecasting robustness. We demonstrate our framework through EXPRTS, a visual analytics tool designed for univariate time series forecasting models and datasets. Different visualizations of the data distribution, forecasting errors and single time series instances enable users to explore time series datasets, apply transformations, and evaluate forecasting model robustness across diverse scenarios. We show how our framework can generate meaningful OOD time series that improve model robustness, and we validate EXPRTS effectiveness and usability through three use-cases and a user study.</p></details> | under review |

This task is typically addressed by finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs. However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations, subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our approach, designated as Hypergraph Structure Learning with Smoothness (HSLS), addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection and convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed convergence. Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits the span of the hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set. In doing so, our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network structures. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms of accuracy, over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods; furthermore, we empirically show our method to be robust to total variation terms, biased towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE for possible publication; Section I includes more applications, comparisons, and enumerated list of novel contributions; removed numerical analysis of TV terms in Section II, added more general discussion; updated Algorithm 1 and corresponding text; third experiment of Section V-C replaced with new experiment</p></details> |

Building upon earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language processing, forecasting, and beyond.</p></details> |  |

First, we formulate and interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words, quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems. Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion $GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |

Although data-driven models can be used to improve transfer decisions, existing models focus on describing players' historical progress, leaving their future performance unknown. Moreover, recent developments have called for the use of explainable models combined with uncertainty quantification of predictions. This paper assesses explainable machine learning models based on predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification methods for the prediction of the future development in quality and transfer value of professional football players. The predictive accuracy is studied by training the models to predict the quality and value of players one year ahead. This is carried out by training them on two data sets containing data-driven indicators describing the player quality and player value in historical settings. In general, the random forest model is found to be the most suitable model because it provides accurate predictions as well as an uncertainty quantification method that naturally arises from the bagging procedure of the random forest model. Additionally, this research shows that the development of player performance contains nonlinear patterns and interactions between variables, and that time series information can provide useful information for the modeling of player performance metrics. The resulting models can help football clubs make more informed, data-driven transfer decisions by forecasting player quality and transfer value.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article itself is on the pages 1-31.

However, their design primarily targets real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios. Codes are released on https://github.com/hanlu-nju/UniCA.</p></details> |  |

Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.</p></details> |  |

As advancements in medical technology and cancer treatment continue, the demand for oncology medications is steadily increasing. Accurate forecasting of cancer drug sales plays a critical role in optimizing production planning, supply chain management, and healthcare policy formulation. The dataset used in this research comprises quarterly sales records of a specific cancer drug in Egypt from 2015 to 2024, including multidimensional information such as date, drug type, pharmaceutical company, price, sales volume, effectiveness, and drug classification. To improve prediction accuracy, a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is employed. The CNN component is responsible for extracting local temporal features from the sales data, while the LSTM component captures long-term dependencies and trends. Model performance is evaluated using two widely adopted metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results demonstrate that the CNN-LSTM model performs well on the test set, achieving an MSE of 1.150 and an RMSE of 1.072, indicating its effectiveness in handling nonlinear and volatile sales data. This research provides theoretical and technical support for data-driven decision-making in pharmaceutical marketing and healthcare resource planning.</p></details> |  |

We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24 anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets, underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and robust model selection.</p></details> |  |

However, the manual modeling of faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling, simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the development of digital twins for industrial environments.</p></details> |  |

However, competing methodologies often face significant challenges, particularly in their reliance on extensive manual efforts for cloud-free data curation and limited adaptability to diverse global conditions. In this paper, we introduce PTAViT3D, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for processing three-dimensional time series of satellite imagery from either Sentinel-1 (S1) or Sentinel-2 (S2). Additionally, we present PTAViT3D-CA, an extension of the PTAViT3D model incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to fuse S1 and S2 datasets, enhancing robustness in cloud-contaminated scenarios. The proposed methods leverage spatio-temporal correlations through a memory-efficient 3D Vision Transformer architecture, facilitating accurate boundary delineation directly from raw, cloud-contaminated imagery. We comprehensively validate our models through extensive testing on various datasets, including Australia's ePaddocks - CSIRO's national agricultural field boundary product - alongside public benchmarks Fields-of-the-World, PASTIS, and AI4SmallFarms.

Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation, consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand, leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.</p></details> |  |

The x-axis represents time, and the time series are displayed as horizontal, variable-height layers stacked on top of each other. The height of each layer corresponds to the time series values at each time point. The main aesthetic criterion for optimizing the readability of stacked area charts is the amount of vertical change of the borders between the time series in the visualization, called wiggle. While many heuristic algorithms have been developed to minimize wiggle, the computational complexity of minimizing wiggle has not been formally analyzed. In this paper, we show that different variants of wiggle minimization are NP-hard and even hard to approximate. We also present an exact mixed-integer linear programming formulation and compare its performance with a state-of-the-art heuristic in an experimental evaluation. Lastly, we consider a special case of wiggle minimization that corresponds to the fundamentally interesting and natural problem of ordering a set of numbers as to minimize their sum of absolute prefix sums. We show several complexity results for this problem that imply some of the mentioned hardness results for wiggle minimization.</p></details> | 19 pages, 3 figures |

Inspired by modern Score- and Flow Matching algorithms for learning generative dynamics, we extend these ideas to the domain of stochastic dynamics for time series and sequence modeling, eliminating the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that SDE Matching achieves performance comparable to adjoint sensitivity methods while drastically reducing computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting the XCZU7EV device.

In e-commerce recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture \textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example, seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE. Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data. Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under non-stationarity for various experimental setups.</p></details> |  |

These interactions can lead to unexpected system-level events, such as transformer overloads or consumer dissatisfaction, that are difficult to detect and explain through static post-processing. This paper presents a modular, Python-based dashboard framework, built using Dash by Plotly, that enables efficient, multi-level exploration and root-cause analysis of emergent behavior in MABS outputs. The system features three coordinated views (System Overview, System Analysis, and Consumer Analysis), each offering high-resolution visualizations such as time-series plots, spatial heatmaps, and agent-specific drill-down tools. A case study simulating full EV adoption with smart charging in a Danish residential network demonstrates how the dashboard supports rapid identification and contextual explanation of anomalies, including clustered transformer overloads and time-dependent charging failures. The framework facilitates actionable insight generation for researchers and distribution system operators, and its architecture is adaptable to other distributed energy resources and complex energy systems.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset.

Linear Vector Autoregressive models (VAR) though have nice interpretation properties but have limited practical application due to underlying assumptions on the kind of associations that can be captured by these models. Numerous attempts have already been made in the literature that exploit the functional approximation power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for the task of GC estimation. These methods however treat GC as a variable selection problem. We present a novel paradigm for approaching GC. We present this idea that GC is essentially linked with prediction and if a deep learning model is used to model the time series collectively or jointly, a well regularized model may learn the true granger causal structure from the data, given that there is enough training data. We propose to uncover the learned GC structure by comparing the model uncertainty or distribution of the residuals when the past of everything is used as compared to the one where a specific time series component is dropped from the model. We also compare the effect of input layer dropout on the ability of a neural network to learn granger causality from the data. We show that a well regularized model infact can learn the true GC structure from the data without explicitly adding terms in the loss function that guide the model to select variables or perform sparse regression.</p></details> |  |

They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This, along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that, if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and coherence are secondary to effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.</p></details> |  |

DIY-MKG allows the user to build personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, which are constructed by selective expansion with related words suggested by an LLM. The system further enhances learning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module that leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition, DIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously increasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement. Our evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary expansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the generated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EMNLP 2025 System Demonstration</p></details> |

Our pipeline reliably extracts such long sequences across diverse topics while avoiding degeneration, then traces them back to their sources in the training data. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial portion of these low-perplexity spans cannot be mapped to the corpus.

Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> |  |

Our method learns a meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU.

However, its reliance on large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization.</p></details> |  |

While data-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability and trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments. To address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an existing dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment contracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses as "valid," "unfair," or "void" under three legal context variants: no legal context, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of these (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text sources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines significantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching 80\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text sources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an extended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources, and corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files.

However, FedLLMs remains highly vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. This article first reviews recent model poisoning techniques and existing defense mechanisms for FedLLMs, highlighting critical limitations, particularly under non-IID text distributions. In particular, current defenses primarily utilize distance-based outlier detection or norm constraints, operating under the assumption that adversarial updates significantly diverge from benign statistics. This assumption can fail when facing adaptive attackers targeting billionparameter LLMs. Next, this article investigates emerging Graph Representation-Based Model Poisoning (GRMP), a novel attack paradigm that leverages higher-order correlations among honest client gradients to synthesize malicious updates indistinguishable from legitimate model updates. GRMP can effectively evade advanced defenses, resulting in substantial accuracy loss and performance degradation. Moreover, this article outlines a research roadmap emphasizing the importance of graph-aware secure aggregation methods, FedLLMs-specific vulnerability metrics, and evaluation frameworks to strengthen the robustness of future federated language model deployments.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

However, SSM-based approaches exhibit limitations in reconstructing localized structures and tend to be less effective when handling high-dimensional data, frequently resulting in suboptimal recovery of fine image features. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Laplace-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Laplace frequency prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing. Leveraging the Laplace decomposition, the image is disentangled into low-frequency components capturing global texture and high-frequency components representing edges and fine details. This decomposition enables specialized processing via dual parallel pathways: the low-frequency branch employs SSMs for global context modeling, while the high-frequency branch utilizes CNNs to refine local structural details, effectively addressing diverse haze scenarios. Notably, the Laplace transformation facilitates information-preserving downsampling of low-frequency components in accordance with the Nyquist theory, thereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency.

Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score (CRPS).</p></details> |  |

The emergence of Vision Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba (EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising, deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks, improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors, further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR. Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing general IR architectures.</p></details> |  |

Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals, symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space. However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks with only 1M parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

We analyze this phenomenon from the perspective of networks attempting to bypass constraints imposed by conventional LayerNorm due to conflicts against requirements in IR tasks. Accordingly, we address two misalignments between LayerNorm and IR tasks, and later show that addressing these mismatches leads to both stabilized training dynamics and improved IR performance. Specifically, conventional LayerNorm works in a per-token manner, disrupting spatial correlations between tokens, essential in IR tasks. Also, it employs an input-independent normalization that restricts the flexibility of feature scales, required to preserve input-specific statistics. Together, these mismatches significantly hinder IR Transformer's ability to accurately preserve low-level features throughout the network. To this end, we introduce Image Restoration Transformer Tailored Layer Normalization~(i-LN), a surprisingly simple drop-in replacement for conventional LayerNorm. We propose to normalize features in a holistic manner across the entire spatio-channel dimension, preserving spatial relationships among individual tokens. Additionally, we introduce an input-adaptive rescaling strategy that maintains the feature range flexibility required by individual inputs. Together, these modifications effectively contribute to preserving low-level feature statistics of inputs throughout IR Transformers. Experimental results verify that this combined strategy enhances both the stability and performance of IR Transformers across various IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel Activation (SCA), and LayerNormalization. We compare this baseline to different variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM) and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance. Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention, while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training.

However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features, conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Enhancing Image Restoration Transformer via Adaptive Translation Equivariance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18520v1)** | 2025-06-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.18520v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translation equivariance is a fundamental inductive bias in image restoration, ensuring that translated inputs produce translated outputs. Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer (TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training convergence, and generalization.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with an accurate understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe degradation.</p></details> |  |

With the emergence of state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels, effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while preserving semantic consistency.</p></details> |  |

To address these, we propose DiffRWKVIR, a novel framework unifying Test-Time Training (TTT) with efficient diffusion. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) Omni-Scale 2D State Evolution extends RWKV's location-dependent parameterization to hierarchical multi-directional 2D scanning, enabling global contextual awareness with linear complexity O(L); (2) Chunk-Optimized Flash Processing accelerates intra-chunk parallelism by 3.2x via contiguous chunk processing (O(LCd) complexity), reducing sequential dependencies and computational overhead; (3) Prior-Guided Efficient Diffusion extracts a compact Image Prior Representation (IPR) in only 5-20 steps, proving 45% faster training/inference than DiffIR while solving computational inefficiency in denoising. Evaluated across super-resolution and inpainting benchmarks (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, Places365), DiffRWKVIR outperforms SwinIR, HAT, and MambaIR/v2 in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and efficiency metrics.

Existing generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation, which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow, a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks, offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 Final Version; Corresponding Author: Bing Li</p></details> |

In this work, we propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors, Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 Final Version; Corresponding Author: Bing Li</p></details> |

Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes, which pose significant challenges for existing methods. Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing and often introduce artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT) modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing. The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration performance.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to traditional approaches -- which typically assume full knowledge of the forward model or access to paired degraded and ground-truth images -- the proposed method operates under minimal assumptions and relies only on small, unpaired datasets. This makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios, where the forward model is often unknown or misspecified, and collecting paired data is costly or infeasible. The method leverages conditional flow matching to model the distribution of degraded observations, while simultaneously learning the forward model via a distribution-matching loss that arises naturally from the framework. Empirically, it outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches on deblurring and non-uniform point spread function (PSF) calibration tasks. It also matches state-of-the-art performance on blind super-resolution. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method with a proof of concept for lens calibration: a real-world application traditionally requiring time-consuming experiments and specialized equipment. In contrast, our approach achieves this with minimal data acquisition effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/inria-thoth/ddm4ip</p></details> |

A popular class of methods, based on Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable posterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression for the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in terms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze the time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step sizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that these step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as colorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity, this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables sampling with fewer time steps than DPS.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities. A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark, ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time by 20 percent. These results highlight the importance of intensity-specific processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks.

Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, also highly effective in other image restoration tasks.

Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging a theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather degradation.

While ViTs generally outperform CNNs by effectively capturing long-range dependencies and input-specific characteristics, their computational complexity increases quadratically with image resolution. This limitation hampers their practical application in high-resolution image restoration. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) for visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. In addition, to more effectively capture and represent local information, we propose an efficient discriminative frequency domain-based feedforward network (EDFFN), which can effectively estimate useful frequency information for latent clear image restoration. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and real-world images.

We propose a new PnP framework, called Stochastic deNOising REgularization (SNORE), which applies the denoiser only on images with noise of the adequate level. It is based on an explicit stochastic regularization, which leads to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve ill-posed inverse problems. A convergence analysis of this algorithm and its annealing extension is provided.

In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors.

The combination of these techniques ensures better detection performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied directly to low-resolution images.

M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity, preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual quality and quantitative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the $\textit{significant}$ superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

However, their inherent formulation as a regression problem makes them prone to regression to the mean, limiting their ability to capture fine details, retain high-frequency information, and handle noise effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Implicit Neural Representations (I-INRs) a novel plug-and-play framework that enhances signal reconstruction through an iterative refinement process. I-INRs effectively recover high-frequency details, improve robustness to noise, and achieve superior reconstruction quality. Our framework seamlessly integrates with existing INR architectures, delivering substantial performance gains across various tasks. Extensive experiments show that I-INRs outperform baseline methods, including WIRE, SIREN, and Gauss, in diverse computer vision applications such as image restoration, image denoising, and object occupancy prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> |

To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p></details> |  |

The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information when shaping the prior, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, taking advantage of the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025 - Camera Ready Version</p></details> |

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations, i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework, named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner. It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps, hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex degradations.</p></details> |  |

While several distillation-based approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration, extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored, particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2, which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically, an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses, including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a single step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft Ver.

However, accelerated acquisition often degrades image quality, impairing the visibility of fine anatomical details and potentially compromising diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, utilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance pediatric rapid bone scintigraphy. Our approach employs two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, supported by three specialized modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules inject domain-specific semantic cues from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM preserves coherent semantic feature representations across both cascaded stages. Moreover, we present RBS, a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset comprising paired standard (20 cm/min) and rapid (40 cm/min) scans from 137 pediatric patients aged 0.5 - 16 years, making it the first dataset tailored for pediatric rapid bone scintigraphy restoration.

By integrating the Mamba network architecture with the diffusion model, the condition network achieves refined conditional control, thereby enhancing the control and optimization of the image generation process. To evaluate the robustness and generalization capability of our method across various image degradation conditions, extensive experiments were conducted on several benchmark datasets, including Rain100H, Rain100L, GoPro, and SSID. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently surpasses existing methods in perceptual quality metrics, such as LPIPS and FID, while maintaining comparable performance in image distortion metrics, including PSNR and SSIM, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing.

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks.

To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |

It can alleviate the data collection burden and enhance the practical applicability of deep learning techniques. However, existing methods suffer from two key drawbacks. Firstly, they are ineffective in handling spatially correlated noise commonly observed in practical applications such as low-light imaging and remote sensing. Secondly, they rely on pixel-wise loss functions that only provide limited supervision information. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging the Fourier domain. We highlight that the Fourier coefficients of spatially correlated noise exhibit sparsity and independence, making them easier to handle. Additionally, Fourier coefficients contain global information, enabling more significant supervision. Motivated by these insights, we propose to establish noisy supervision in the Fourier domain. We first prove that Fourier coefficients of a wide range of noise converge in distribution to the Gaussian distribution. Exploiting this statistical property, we establish the equivalence between using noisy targets and clean targets in the Fourier domain. This leads to a unified learning framework applicable to various image restoration tasks, diverse network architectures, and different noise models. Extensive experiments validate the outstanding performance of this framework in terms of both quantitative indices and perceptual quality.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically require training a bridge model from scratch for each specific type of degradation, resulting in high computational costs and limited performance. This work aims to efficiently leverage pretrained generative priors within existing image restoration bridges to eliminate this requirement. The main challenge is that standard generative models are typically designed for a diffusion process that starts from pure noise, while restoration tasks begin with a low-quality image, resulting in a mismatch in the state distributions between the two processes. To address this challenge, we propose a transition equation that bridges two diffusion processes with the same endpoint distribution. Based on this, we introduce the IRBridge framework, which enables the direct utilization of generative models within image restoration bridges, offering a more flexible and adaptable approach to image restoration. Extensive experiments on six image restoration tasks demonstrate that IRBridge efficiently integrates generative priors, resulting in improved robustness and generalization performance.

This paper introduces Self-Improved Privilege Learning (SIPL), a novel paradigm that overcomes these limitations by innovatively extending the utility of privileged information (PI) beyond training into the inference stage. Unlike conventional Privilege Learning, where ground-truth-derived guidance is typically discarded after training, SIPL empowers the model to leverage its own preliminary outputs as pseudo-privileged signals for iterative self-refinement at test time. Central to SIPL is Proxy Fusion, a lightweight module incorporating a learnable Privileged Dictionary. During training, this dictionary distills essential high-frequency and structural priors from privileged feature representations. Critically, at inference, the same learned dictionary then interacts with features derived from the model's initial restoration, facilitating a self-correction loop. SIPL can be seamlessly integrated into various backbone architectures, offering substantial performance improvements with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIPL significantly advances the state-of-the-art on diverse all-in-one image restoration benchmarks. For instance, when integrated with the PromptIR model, SIPL achieves remarkable PSNR improvements of +4.58 dB on composite degradation tasks and +1.28 dB on diverse five-task benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness and broad applicability. Codes are available at our project page https://github.com/Aitical/SIPL.</p></details> |  |

However, generating accurate lesion descriptions remains challenging due to spurious correlations from visual-linguistic biases and inherent limitations of radiological imaging, such as low resolution and noise interference. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage framework named CrossModal Causal Representation Learning (CMCRL), consisting of the Radiological Cross-modal Alignment and Reconstruction Enhanced (RadCARE) pre-training and the Visual-Linguistic Causal Intervention (VLCI) fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, RadCARE introduces a degradation-aware masked image restoration strategy tailored for radiological images, which reconstructs high-resolution patches from low-resolution inputs to mitigate noise and detail loss. Combined with a multiway architecture and four adaptive training strategies (e.g., text postfix generation with degraded images and text prefixes), RadCARE establishes robust cross-modal correlations even with incomplete data. In the VLCI phase, we deploy causal front-door intervention through two modules: the Visual Deconfounding Module (VDM) disentangles local-global features without fine-grained annotations, while the Linguistic Deconfounding Module (LDM) eliminates context bias without external terminology databases. Experiments on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR show that our CMCRL pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both stages.

PnP approaches, a class of iterative algorithms where regularization is implicitly performed by an off-the-shelf deep denoiser, are flexible for varying compression ratios (CRs) but are limited in reconstruction accuracy and speed. Conversely, unrolling approaches, a class of multi-stage neural networks where a truncated iterative optimization process is transformed into an end-to-end trainable network, typically achieve better accuracy with faster inference but require fine-tuning or even retraining when CR changes. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating the strengths of both classes of solvers. To this end, we design an efficient deep image restorer (DIR) for the unrolling of HQS (half quadratic splitting) and ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers). More importantly, a general proximal trajectory (PT) loss function is proposed to train HQS/ADMM-unrolling networks such that learned DIR approximates the proximal operator of an ideal explicit restoration regularizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, the resulting proximal unrolling networks can not only flexibly handle varying CRs with a single model like PnP algorithms, but also outperform previous CR-specific unrolling networks in both reconstruction accuracy and speed.

To address these challenges, we introduce a Unified Receptance Weighted Key Value (URWKV) model with multi-state perspective, enabling flexible and effective degradation restoration for low-light images. Specifically, we customize the core URWKV block to perceive and analyze complex degradations by leveraging multiple intra- and inter-stage states. First, inspired by the pupil mechanism in the human visual system, we propose Luminance-adaptive Normalization (LAN) that adjusts normalization parameters based on rich inter-stage states, allowing for adaptive, scene-aware luminance modulation. Second, we aggregate multiple intra-stage states through exponential moving average approach, effectively capturing subtle variations while mitigating information loss inherent in the single-state mechanism. To reduce the degradation effects commonly associated with conventional skip connections, we propose the State-aware Selective Fusion (SSF) module, which dynamically aligns and integrates multi-state features across encoder stages, selectively fusing contextual information. In comparison to state-of-the-art models, our URWKV model achieves superior performance on various benchmarks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However, due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers. EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |

Although existing AiOIR approaches obtain promising performance in closed and controlled scenarios, they still suffered from considerable performance reduction in real-world scenarios since the gap of data distributions between the training samples (source domain) and real-world test samples (target domain) can lead inferior degradation awareness ability. To address this issue, a Unified Domain-Adaptive Image Restoration (UDAIR) framework is proposed to effectively achieve AiOIR by leveraging the learned knowledge from source domain to target domain. To improve the degradation identification, a codebook is designed to learn a group of discrete embeddings to denote the degradation patterns, and the cross-sample contrastive learning mechanism is further proposed to capture shared features from different samples of certain degradation. To bridge the data gap, a domain adaptation strategy is proposed to build the feature projection between the source and target domains by dynamically aligning their codebook embeddings, and a correlation alignment-based test-time adaptation mechanism is designed to fine-tune the alignment discrepancies by tightening the degradation embeddings to the corresponding cluster center in the source domain. Experimental results on 10 open-source datasets demonstrate that UDAIR achieves new state-of-the-art performance for the AiOIR task. Most importantly, the feature cluster validate the degradation identification under unknown conditions, and qualitative comparisons showcase robust generalization to real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

First, we synthesize document-image pairs from plaintext, rendering them with diverse fonts and layouts and then applying a randomly ordered set of degradation operations. An image restoration model is trained on this synthetic data, using multi-directional patch extraction and fusion to process large images. Second, a ByT5 post-OCR model, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text pairs, addresses remaining OCR errors. Detailed experiments on 13,831 pages of real historical documents in English, French, and Spanish show that the PreP-OCR pipeline reduces character error rates by 63.9-70.3% compared to OCR on raw images. Our pipeline demonstrates the potential of integrating image restoration with linguistic error correction for digitizing historical archives.</p></details> | ACL 2025 main |

While reference faces offer a path forward, existing reference-based methods often fail to fully exploit their potential. This paper introduces a novel approach that maximizes reference face utility for improved face restoration and identity preservation. Our method makes three key contributions: 1) Composite Context, a comprehensive representation that fuses multi-level (high- and low-level) information from the reference face, offering richer guidance than prior singular representations. 2) Hard Example Identity Loss, a novel loss function that leverages the reference face to address the identity learning inefficiencies found in the existing identity loss. 3) A training-free method to adapt the model to multi-reference inputs during inference. The proposed method demonstrably restores high-quality faces and achieves state-of-the-art identity preserving restoration on benchmarks such as FFHQ-Ref and CelebA-Ref-Test, consistently outperforming previous work.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a multi-source representation learning framework BaryIR, which decomposes the latent space of multi-source degraded images into a continuous barycenter space for unified feature encoding and source-specific subspaces for specific semantic encoding. Specifically, we seek the multi-source unified representation by introducing a multi-source latent optimal transport barycenter problem, in which a continuous barycenter map is learned to transport the latent representations to the barycenter space. The transport cost is designed such that the representations from source-specific subspaces are contrasted with each other while maintaining orthogonality to those from the barycenter space. This enables BaryIR to learn compact representations with unified degradation-agnostic information from the barycenter space, as well as degradation-specific semantics from source-specific subspaces, capturing the inherent geometry of multi-source data manifold for generalizable AIR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Particularly, BaryIR exhibits superior generalization ability to real-world data and unseen degradations. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/xl-tang3/BaryIR.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods often suffer from limited representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration, providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the degenerate PPP method exhibits weak convergence in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and lacks accelerated variants. To address these issues, we propose a Halpern-type PPP (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence and acceleration properties of Halpern's iteration method. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm for image restoration by combining HPPP with denoiser priors such as Plug-and-Play (PnP) prior, which can be viewed as an accelerated PnP method. Finally, numerical experiments including several toy examples and image restoration validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, persistent visual degradation, including smoke generated by energy devices, lens fogging from thermal gradients, and lens contamination due to blood or tissue fluid splashes during surgical procedures, severely impair visual clarity. These degenerations can seriously hinder surgical workflow and pose risks to patient safety. To systematically investigate and address various forms of surgical scene degradation, we introduce a real-world open-source surgical image restoration dataset covering laparoscopic environments, called SurgClean, which involves multi-type image restoration tasks, e.g., desmoking, defogging, and desplashing. SurgClean comprises 1,020 images with diverse degradation types and corresponding paired reference labels. Based on SurgClean, we establish a standardized evaluation benchmark and provide performance for 22 representative generic task-specific image restoration approaches, including 12 generic and 10 task-specific image restoration approaches. Experimental results reveal substantial performance gaps relative to clinical requirements, highlighting a critical opportunity for algorithm advancements in intelligent surgical restoration. Furthermore, we explore the degradation discrepancies between surgical and natural scenes from structural perception and semantic understanding perspectives, providing fundamental insights for domain-specific image restoration research. Our work aims to empower the capabilities of restoration algorithms to increase surgical environments and improve the efficiency of clinical procedures.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, especially those relying on direct image-to-image restoration, often fail to disentangle these intertwined artifacts effectively. While wavelet-based frequency-aware approaches offer a promising direction, their potential remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Freqformer, a Transformer-based framework specifically designed for image demoir\'eing through targeted frequency separation. Our method performs an effective frequency decomposition that explicitly splits moir\'e patterns into high-frequency spatially-localized textures and low-frequency scale-robust color distortions, which are then handled by a dual-branch architecture tailored to their distinct characteristics. We further propose a learnable Frequency Composition Transform (FCT) module to adaptively fuse the frequency-specific outputs, enabling consistent and high-fidelity reconstruction. To better aggregate the spatial dependencies and the inter-channel complementary information, we introduce a Spatial-Aware Channel Attention (SA-CA) module that refines moir\'e-sensitive regions without incurring high computational cost. Extensive experiments on various demoir\'eing benchmarks demonstrate that Freqformer achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact model size.

Despite recent advances, most existing approaches treat IR as a direct mapping problem, relying on shared representations across degradation types without modeling their structural diversity. In this work, we present MIRAGE, a unified and lightweight framework for all in one IR that explicitly decomposes the input feature space into three semantically aligned parallel branches, each processed by a specialized module attention for global context, convolution for local textures, and MLP for channel-wise statistics. This modular decomposition significantly improves generalization and efficiency across diverse degradations. Furthermore, we introduce a cross layer contrastive learning scheme that aligns shallow and latent features to enhance the discriminability of shared representations. To better capture the underlying geometry of feature representations, we perform contrastive learning in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space rather than the conventional Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that MIRAGE not only achieves new state of the art performance across a variety of degradation types but also offers a scalable solution for challenging all-in-one IR scenarios.

However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task.

However, UniDB's reliance on iterative Euler sampling methods results in slow, computationally expensive inference, while existing acceleration techniques for diffusion or diffusion bridge models fail to address its unique challenges: missing terminal mean constraints and SOC-specific penalty coefficients in its SDEs. We present UniDB++, a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly improves upon these limitations. The method's key advancement comes from deriving exact closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDEs, effectively reducing the error accumulation inherent in Euler approximations and enabling high-quality generation with up to 20$\times$ fewer sampling steps. This method is further complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains perceptual quality for low-step regimes (5-10 steps). Additionally, we demonstrate that UniDB++ aligns with existing diffusion bridge acceleration methods by evaluating their update rules, and UniDB++ can recover DBIMs as special cases under some theoretical conditions. Experiments demonstrate UniDB++'s state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks, outperforming Euler-based methods in fidelity and speed while reducing inference time significantly.

Accurately estimating the underlying degradation can intuitively provide restoration models with more targeted and effective guidance, enabling adaptive processing strategies. To this end, we propose a Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism (MODEM) for adverse weather image restoration. Central to MODEM is the Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module (MOS2D), which integrates Morton-coded spatial ordering with selective state-space models to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local structural coherence. Complementing MOS2D, we introduce a Dual Degradation Estimation Module (DDEM) that disentangles and estimates both global and local degradation priors. These priors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and context-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex degradation dynamics.

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradation specific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms state-of-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in this field are predominantly driven by deep learning-based innovations, including enhancements in dataset construction, network architecture, sampling strategies, prior knowledge integration, and loss functions. In this paper, we systematically review recent progress in UHD image restoration, covering various aspects ranging from dataset construction to algorithm design.

We begin by summarizing degradation models for various image restoration subproblems, such as super-resolution, low-light enhancement, deblurring, dehazing, deraining, and desnowing, and emphasizing the unique challenges of their application to UHD image restoration. We then highlight existing UHD benchmark datasets and organize the literature according to degradation types and dataset construction methods. Following this, we showcase major milestones in deep learning-driven UHD image restoration, reviewing the progression of restoration tasks, technological developments, and evaluations of existing methods. We further propose a classification framework based on network architectures and sampling strategies, helping to clearly organize existing methods.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer hinders its applicability to high-resolution images. Existing methods mitigate this issue with sparse or window-based attention, yet inherently limit global context modeling. Linear attention, a variant of softmax attention, demonstrates promise in global context modeling while maintaining linear complexity, offering a potential solution to the above challenge. Despite its efficiency benefits, vanilla linear attention suffers from a significant performance drop in IR, largely due to the low-rank nature of its attention map. To counter this, we propose Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA), a simple yet effective method that enriches feature representations by integrating a lightweight depthwise convolution. Building upon RELA, we propose an efficient and effective image restoration Transformer, named LAformer. LAformer achieves effective global perception by integrating linear attention and channel attention, while also enhancing local fitting capabilities through a convolutional gated feed-forward network. Notably, LAformer eliminates hardware-inefficient operations such as softmax and window shifting, enabling efficient processing of high-resolution images. Extensive experiments across 7 IR tasks and 21 benchmarks demonstrate that LAformer outperforms SOTA methods and offers significant computational advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Our approach introduces two key innovations: 1) an \textbf{a}daptive \textbf{n}ormalization mechanism inspired by the nGPT architecture that enables ultra-fast and stable training with a network with a restricted range of parameter expressions; and 2) we devise an atmospheric scattering-aware KV caching mechanism that dynamically optimizes feature preservation based on the physical haze formation model. The proposed architecture improves the training convergence speed by \textbf{5 $\times$} while reducing memory overhead, enabling real-time processing of 50 high-resolution images per second on an RTX4090 GPU. Experimental results show that our approach maintains state-of-the-art dehazing quality while significantly improving computational efficiency for 4K/8K image restoration tasks. Furthermore, we provide a new dehazing image interpretable method with the help of an integrated gradient attribution map.

Image degradation, often caused by factors such as rain, fog, lighting, etc., has a negative impact on automated decision-making.Furthermore, several image restoration solutions exist, including restoration models for single degradation and restoration models for multiple degradations. However, these solutions are not suitable for real-time processing. In this study, the aim was to develop a real-time image restoration solution for video surveillance. To achieve this, using transfer learning with ResNet_50, we developed a model for automatically identifying the types of degradation present in an image to reference the necessary treatment(s) for image restoration. Our solution has the advantage of being flexible and scalable.</p></details> |  |

While significant progress has been made, there are still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches depend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex or unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second, many methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and finally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain for guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations through a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse transform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline through two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the pixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space to reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate latent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward model to handle unknown degradations. In addition, a regularization step preserves the proximity of latent variables to the natural image manifold. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world low-quality images, and can be readily adapted to arbitrary output sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |

Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code, and dataset of this project will be released upon publication at github.com/yangwenbo99/content-degradation-disentanglement.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the significant variations among degradation types present challenges for training a universal model, often resulting in task interference, where the gradient update directions of different tasks may diverge due to shared parameters. To address this issue, motivated by the routing strategy, we propose DFPIR, a novel all-in-one image restorer that introduces Degradation-aware Feature Perturbations(DFP) to adjust the feature space to align with the unified parameter space. In this paper, the feature perturbations primarily include channel-wise perturbations and attention-wise perturbations. Specifically, channel-wise perturbations are implemented by shuffling the channels in high-dimensional space guided by degradation types, while attention-wise perturbations are achieved through selective masking in the attention space. To achieve these goals, we propose a Degradation-Guided Perturbation Block (DGPB) to implement these two functions, positioned between the encoding and decoding stages of the encoder-decoder architecture. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DFPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several all-in-one image restoration tasks including image denoising, image dehazing, image deraining, motion deblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

In this work, we investigate its potential impact on the image restoration community. We present the first systematic evaluation of GPT-4o across diverse restoration tasks. Our experiments reveal that, although restoration outputs from GPT-4o are visually appealing, they often suffer from pixel-level structural fidelity when compared to ground-truth images. Common issues are variations in image proportions, shifts in object positions and quantities, and changes in viewpoint. To address it, taking image dehazing, derainning, and low-light enhancement as representative case studies, we show that GPT-4o's outputs can serve as powerful visual priors, substantially enhancing the performance of existing dehazing networks. It offers practical guidelines and a baseline framework to facilitate the integration of GPT-4o into future image restoration pipelines. We hope the study on GPT-4o image restoration will accelerate innovation in the broader field of image generation areas. To support further research, we will release GPT-4o-restored images.</p></details> |  |

However, reducing acquisition time to increase throughput inevitably introduces significant noise into the measurements. We present a machine learning approach that not only denoises low-quality measurements with calibrated uncertainty bounds, but also reveals emergent structure in the latent space. By using ensembles of lightweight, randomly structured neural networks trained via conformal quantile regression, our method performs reliable denoising while uncovering interpretable spatial and chemical features -- without requiring labels or segmentation. Unlike conventional approaches focused solely on image restoration, our framework leverages the denoising process itself to drive the emergence of meaningful representations. We validate the approach on real-world geobiochemical imaging data, showing how it supports confident interpretation and guides experimental design under resource constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods don't adequately account for generalizability issues, and hence typically show limited performance and low stability on test data from other sources. Considering the limited availability of distinct data sources, we seek to improve the generalization performance of a pancreas segmentation model trained with a single-source dataset, i.e., the single source generalization task. In particular, we propose a dual self-supervised learning model that incorporates both global and local anatomical contexts. Our model aims to fully exploit the anatomical features of the intra-pancreatic and extra-pancreatic regions, and hence enhance the characterization of the high-uncertainty regions for more robust generalization. Specifically, we first construct a global-feature contrastive self-supervised learning module that is guided by the pancreatic spatial structure. This module obtains complete and consistent pancreatic features through promoting intra-class cohesion, and also extracts more discriminative features for differentiating between pancreatic and non-pancreatic tissues through maximizing inter-class separation. It mitigates the influence of surrounding tissue on the segmentation outcomes in high-uncertainty regions. Subsequently, a local-image restoration self-supervised learning module is introduced to further enhance the characterization of the high uncertainty regions. In this module, informative anatomical contexts are actually learned to recover randomly corrupted appearance patterns in those regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by IEEE JBHI.

However, the performance of DUN-based methods remains considerably inferior to that of state-of-the-art IDIR solvers. Our investigation indicates that this limitation does not stem from structural shortcomings of DUNs but rather from the limited exploration of the unfolding structure, particularly for (1) constructing task-specific restoration models, (2) integrating advanced network architectures, and (3) designing DUN-specific loss functions. To address these issues, we propose a novel DUN-based method, UnfoldIR, for IDIR tasks. UnfoldIR first introduces a new IDIR model with dedicated regularization terms for smoothing illumination and enhancing texture. We unfold the iterative optimized solution of this model into a multistage network, with each stage comprising a reflectance-assisted illumination correction (RAIC) module and an illumination-guided reflectance enhancement (IGRE) module. RAIC employs a visual state space (VSS) to extract non-local features, enforcing illumination smoothness, while IGRE introduces a frequency-aware VSS to globally align similar textures, enabling mildly degraded regions to guide the enhancement of details in more severely degraded areas. This suppresses noise while enhancing details. Furthermore, given the multistage structure, we propose an inter-stage information consistent loss to maintain network stability in the final stages. This loss contributes to structural preservation and sustains the model's performance even in unsupervised settings. Experiments verify our effectiveness across 5 IDIR tasks and 3 downstream problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 tables, 11 figures</p></details> |

Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a single image input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 SyntaGen Workshop, Project Page: https://yc4ny.github.io/SVAD/</p></details> |

Moreover, they struggle to balance the commonality of degradation representations and restoration quality. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{DGSolver}, a diffusion generalist solver with universal posterior sampling. We first derive the exact ordinary differential equations for generalist diffusion models and tailor high-order solvers with a queue-based accelerated sampling strategy to improve both accuracy and efficiency. We then integrate universal posterior sampling to better approximate manifold-constrained gradients, yielding a more accurate noise estimation and correcting errors in inverse inference. Extensive experiments show that DGSolver outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoration accuracy, stability, and scalability, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Moreover, these methods often utilize highly customized backbones, which hinder their adaptability and integration into more advanced restoration networks. To address these limitations, we propose Perceive-IR, a novel backbone-agnostic All-in-One image restoration framework designed for fine-grained quality control across various degradation types and severity levels. Its modular structure allows core components to function independently of specific backbones, enabling seamless integration into advanced restoration models without significant modifications. Specifically, Perceive-IR operates in two key stages: 1) multi-level quality-driven prompt learning stage, where a fine-grained quality perceiver is meticulously trained to discern three tier quality levels by optimizing the alignment between prompts and images within the CLIP perception space. This stage ensures a nuanced understanding of image quality, laying the groundwork for subsequent restoration; 2) restoration stage, where the quality perceiver is seamlessly integrated with a difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss, forming a quality-aware learning strategy. This strategy not only dynamically differentiates sample learning difficulty but also achieves fine-grained quality control by driving the restored image toward the ground truth while pulling it away from both low- and medium-quality samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.

Consequently, image restoration has emerged as a key solution and garnered substantial attention. Although recent Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive success across various restoration tasks, their considerable model complexity poses significant challenges for both training and real-time deployment. Furthermore, instead of investigating the commonalities among different degradations, most existing restoration methods focus on modifying Transformer under limited restoration priors. In this work, we first review various degradation phenomena under multi-domain perspective, identifying common priors. Then, we introduce a novel restoration framework, which integrates multi-domain learning into Transformer. Specifically, in Token Mixer, we propose a Spatial-Wavelet-Fourier multi-domain structure that facilitates local-region-global multi-receptive field modeling to replace vanilla self-attention. Additionally, in Feed-Forward Network, we incorporate multi-scale learning to fuse multi-domain features at different resolutions. Comprehensive experimental results across ten restoration tasks, such as dehazing, desnowing, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, rain streak/raindrop removal, cloud removal, shadow removal, underwater enhancement and low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a favorable trade-off among restoration performance, parameter size, computational cost and inference latency.

Unlike existing methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting, moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities. Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis, incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our dataset and code will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the strong visual context modeling capacity of pre-trained video diffusion transformers, we propose FramePrompt, a minimalist yet powerful framework that treats reference images, skeleton-guided motion, and target video clips as a unified visual sequence. By reformulating animation as a conditional future prediction task, we bypass the need for guider networks and structural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms representative baselines across various evaluation metrics while also simplifying training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of sequence-level visual conditioning and demonstrate the potential of pre-trained models for controllable animation without architectural changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://frameprompt.github.io/</p></details> |

This survey provides a comprehensive review and critical analysis of GenAI in network optimization. We focus on the two dominant paradigms of GenAI including generative diffusion models (GDMs) and large pre-trained models (LPTMs), and organize our discussion around a categorization we introduce, dividing network optimization problems into two primary formulations: one-shot optimization and Markov decision process (MDP). We first trace key works, including foundational contributions from the AI community, and categorize current efforts in network optimization. We also review frontier applications of GDMs and LPTMs in other networking tasks, providing additional context. Furthermore, we present theoretical generalization bounds for GDMs in both one-shot and MDP settings, offering insights into the fundamental factors affecting model performance. Most importantly, we reflect on the overestimated perception of GenAI's general capabilities and caution against the all-in-one illusion it may convey. We highlight critical limitations, including difficulties in constraint satisfying, limited concept understanding, and the inherent probabilistic nature of outputs. We also propose key future directions, such as bridging the gap between generation and optimization. Although they are increasingly integrated in implementations, they differ fundamentally in both objectives and underlying mechanisms, necessitating a deeper understanding of their theoretical connections. Ultimately, this survey aims to provide a structured overview and a deeper insight into the strengths, limitations, and potential of GenAI in network optimization.</p></details> |  |

Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, mapping each image back to its approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial Gaussian noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image regions. As a consequence of this divergence, we present that the space of image inversions is notably less manipulative than the original Gaussian noise. Next, we explain the origin of the phenomenon, demonstrating that, during the first inversion steps, the noise prediction error is much more significant for the plain areas than for the rest of the image. As a surprisingly simple solution, we propose to replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, which successfully decorrelates latent encodings, leading to higher quality editions and interpolations.

Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

These tokens are fused with mmWave radar measurements to construct a semantic risk heatmap reflecting motion density, occlusion, and scene complexity, which guides access technology selection and resource scheduling. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly maximize weighted energy and perception efficiency via radio access technology (RAT) assignment, power control, and beamforming, subject to agent-specific QoS constraints. To solve this, we develop De-Diffusion-driven vision-aided risk-aware resource optimization algorithm DeDiff-VARARO, a novel two-stage cross-modal control algorithm: the first stage reconstructs visual scenes from tokens via De-Diffusion model for semantic parsing, while the second stage employs a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based policy to adapt RAT selection, power control, and beam assignment based on fused radar-visual states. Simulation results show that DeDiff-VARARO consistently outperforms baselines in reward convergence, link robustness, and semantic fidelity, achieving within $4\%$ of the performance of a raw-image upper bound while preserving user privacy and scalability in dense environments.</p></details> |  |

One of the key questions in this area is the loss functions these models shall train with. Multiple formulations have been introduced in the literature over the past several years with some links and some critical differences stemming from various initial considerations. In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECML 2025</p></details> |

To extract these features from real images with sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without a source prompt.

We argue that the external alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\% increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively, SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer).

While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF) module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention. To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/DiffMark.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space, enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM). It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models. Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Current research on video generation suggests a promising avenue for controllable film creation in pixel space using Diffusion models. However, the reliance on overly verbose prompts and insufficient focus on cinematic elements (e.g., camera movement) results in videos that lack cinematic quality. Furthermore, the absence of 3D modeling often leads to failures in video generation, such as inconsistent character models at different frames, ultimately hindering the immersive experience for viewers. In this paper, we propose a new framework for film creation, Dream-Cinema, which is designed for user-friendly, 3D space-based film creation with generative models. Specifically, we decompose 3D film creation into four key elements: 3D character, driven motion, camera movement, and environment. We extract the latter three elements from user-specified film shots and generate the 3D character using a generative model based on a provided image. To seamlessly recombine these elements and ensure smooth film creation, we propose structure-guided character animation, shape-aware camera movement optimization, and environment-aware generative refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality films with free camera and 3D characters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://liuff19.github.io/DreamCinema</p></details> |

However, these methods often struggle with tasks such as object insertion. Our investigation of these failures reveals significant variations in gradient magnitude and spatial distribution, making hyperparameter tuning highly input-specific or unsuccessful. To address this, we propose two simple yet effective modifications: attention-based spatial regularization and gradient filtering-normalization, both aimed at reducing these variations during gradient updates. Experimental results show our method outperforms state-of-the-art score distillation techniques in prompt fidelity, improving successful edits while preserving the background. Users also preferred our method over state-of-the-art techniques across three metrics, and by 58-64% overall.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10\% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |

However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM), a generative framework that achieves 10x spatial super-resolution (downscaling to 1 km) and delivers a 9x inference speedup over pixel-based diffusion models. WDM is a conditional diffusion model that learns the learns the complex structure of precipitation from MRMS radar data directly in the wavelet domain. By focusing on high-frequency wavelet coefficients, it generates exceptionally realistic and detailed 1-km precipitation fields. This wavelet-based approach produces visually superior results with fewer artifacts than pixel-space models, and delivers a significant gains in sampling efficiency. Our results demonstrate that WDM provides a robust solution to the dual challenges of accuracy and speed in geoscience super-resolution, paving the way for more reliable hydrological forecasts.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often rely on pre-rendered glyph images as conditions, but these struggle to retain original font styles and color cues, necessitating complex multi-branch designs that increase model overhead and reduce flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a segmentation-guided framework that uses pixel-level visual text masks -- rich in glyph shape, color, and spatial detail -- as unified conditional inputs. Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual segmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined diffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a region-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark, significantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To enable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks: GlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex typesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in small-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at small text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong generalization and deployment readiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, these advancements also introduce an underexplored attack opportunity: the possibility of inducing biases by an adversary into the generated images for malicious intentions, e.g., to influence public opinion and spread propaganda. In this paper, we study an attack vector that allows an adversary to inject arbitrary bias into a target model. The attack leverages low-cost backdooring techniques using a targeted set of natural textual triggers embedded within a small number of malicious data samples produced with public generative models. An adversary could pick common sequences of words that can then be inadvertently activated by benign users during inference. We investigate the feasibility and challenges of such attacks, demonstrating how modern generative models have made this adversarial process both easier and more adaptable. On the other hand, we explore various aspects of the detectability of such attacks and demonstrate that the model's utility remains intact in the absence of the triggers. Our extensive experiments using over 200,000 generated images and against hundreds of fine-tuned models demonstrate the feasibility of the presented backdoor attack. We illustrate how these biases maintain strong text-image alignment, highlighting the challenges in detecting biased images without knowing that bias in advance. Our cost analysis confirms the low financial barrier ($10-$15) to executing such attacks, underscoring the need for robust defensive strategies against such vulnerabilities in diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to USENIX Security '25</p></details> |

This paper considers a multi-user downlink SemCom system, using vehicular networks as the representative scenario for multi-user content dissemination. To address diverse yet overlapping user demands, we propose a multi-user Generative SemCom-enhanced intent-aware semantic-splitting multiple access (SS-MGSC) framework. In the framework, we construct an intent-aware shared knowledge base (SKB) that incorporates prior knowledge of semantic information (SI) and user-specific preferences. Then, we designate the common SI as a one-hot semantic map that is broadcast to all users, while the private SI is delivered as personalized text for each user. On the receiver side, a diffusion model enhanced with ControlNet is adopted to generate high-quality personalized images. To capture both semantic relevance and perceptual similarity, we design a novel semantic efficiency score (SES) metric as the optimization objective. Building on this, we formulate a joint optimization problem for multi-user semantic extraction and beamforming, solved using a reinforcement learning-based algorithm due to its robustness in high-dimensional settings. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

Among them, Stable Diffusion (StableDiff) stands out as a key model for text-to-image generation and a foundation for next-generation multi-modal algorithms. However, its high computational and memory demands hinder inference speed and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we identify three core issues: (1) intensive and often redundant computations, (2) heterogeneous operations involving convolutions and attention mechanisms, and (3) diverse weight and activation sizes. We present SD-Acc, a novel algorithm and hardware co-optimization framework. At the algorithm level, we observe that high-level features in certain denoising phases show significant similarity, enabling approximate computation. Leveraging this, we propose an adaptive, phase-aware sampling strategy that reduces compute and memory loads. This framework automatically balances image quality and complexity based on the StableDiff model and user requirements. At the hardware level, we design an address-centric dataflow to efficiently handle heterogeneous operations within a simple systolic array. We address the bottleneck of nonlinear functions via a two-stage streaming architecture and a reconfigurable vector processing unit. Additionally, we implement adaptive dataflow optimizations by combining dynamic reuse and operator fusion tailored to StableDiff workloads, significantly reducing memory access. Across multiple StableDiff models, our method achieves up to a 3x reduction in computational demand without compromising image quality. Combined with our optimized hardware accelerator, SD-Acc delivers higher speed and energy efficiency than traditional CPU and GPU implementations.</p></details> | Under Review |

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model, Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple, the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format. Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes, an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios.

Dominant methods based on contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours, for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models (DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Generative methods, which have demonstrated success in computer vision, are notably absent from zero-shot environmental sound classification studies. To address this gap, this work investigates generative methods for zero-shot learning in environmental audio.

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1$.$dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x.

Although some recent methods utilize image diffusion models for VSR and have shown improved detail generation capabilities, they still struggle to produce temporally consistent frames. We attempt to use Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) combined with ControlNet to address this issue. However, due to the intrinsic image-animation characteristics of SVD, it is challenging to generate fine details using only low-quality videos. To tackle this problem, we propose DAM-VSR, an appearance and motion disentanglement framework for VSR. This framework disentangles VSR into appearance enhancement and motion control problems. Specifically, appearance enhancement is achieved through reference image super-resolution, while motion control is achieved through video ControlNet. This disentanglement fully leverages the generative prior of video diffusion models and the detail generation capabilities of image super-resolution models. Furthermore, equipped with the proposed motion-aligned bidirectional sampling strategy, DAM-VSR can conduct VSR on longer input videos. DAM-VSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world data and AIGC data, demonstrating its powerful detail generation capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGGRAPH 2025, Homepage: https://kongzhecn.github.io/projects/dam-vsr/ Github: https://github.com/kongzhecn/DAM-VSR</p></details> |

While existing kinematics motion generation with diffusion models offer intuitive steering capabilities with inference-time conditioning, they often fail to produce physically viable motions. In contrast, recent diffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating physically realizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction limits their steerability. Diffuse-CLoC addresses these challenges through a key insight: modeling the joint distribution of states and actions within a single diffusion model makes action generation steerable by conditioning it on the predicted states. This approach allows us to leverage established conditioning techniques from kinematic motion generation while producing physically realistic motions. As a result, we achieve planning capabilities without the need for a high-level planner. Our method handles a diverse set of unseen long-horizon downstream tasks through a single pre-trained model, including static and dynamic obstacle avoidance, motion in-betweening, and task-space control. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the traditional hierarchical framework of high-level motion diffusion and low-level tracking.</p></details> |  |

Given a language command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://rigvid-robot.github.io/</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.</p></details> |  |

However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

| **[Bridging SFT and DPO for Diffusion Model Alignment with Self-Sampling Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05255v2)** | 2025-07-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.05255v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing post-training techniques are broadly categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods; the former is stable during training but suffers from limited generalization, while the latter, despite its stronger generalization capability, relies on additional preference data or reward models and carries the risk of reward exploitation. In order to preserve the advantages of both SFT and RL -- namely, eliminating the need for paired data and reward models while retaining the training stability of SFT and the generalization ability of RL -- a new alignment method, Self-Sampling Preference Optimization (SSPO), is proposed in this paper. SSPO introduces a Random Checkpoint Replay (RCR) strategy that utilizes historical checkpoints to construct paired data, thereby effectively mitigating overfitting. Simultaneously, a Self-Sampling Regularization (SSR) strategy is employed to dynamically evaluate the quality of generated samples; when the generated samples are more likely to be winning samples, the approach automatically switches from DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) to SFT, ensuring that the training process accurately reflects the quality of the samples. Experimental results demonstrate that SSPO not only outperforms existing methods on text-to-image benchmarks, but its effectiveness has also been validated in text-to-video tasks. We validate SSPO across both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks. SSPO surpasses all previous approaches on the text-to-image benchmarks and demonstrates outstanding performance on the text-to-video benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

Existing approaches either incur substantial computational overhead through noise optimization or compromise semantic fidelity by aggressively pruning tokens. In this work, we propose OptiPrune, a unified framework that combines distribution-aware initial noise optimization with similarity-based token pruning to address both challenges simultaneously. Specifically, (1) we introduce a distribution-aware noise optimization module guided by attention scores to steer the initial latent noise toward semantically meaningful regions, mitigating issues such as subject neglect and feature entanglement; (2) we design a hardware-efficient token pruning strategy that selects representative base tokens via patch-wise similarity, injects randomness to enhance generalization, and recovers pruned tokens using maximum similarity copying before attention operations. Our method preserves the Gaussian prior during noise optimization and enables efficient inference without sacrificing alignment quality. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Animal-Animal, demonstrate that OptiPrune achieves state-of-the-art prompt-image consistency with significantly reduced computational cost.</p></details> |  |

With the powerful generative capabilities of the diffusion model, the task has shown the potential to generate high-fidelity visual content. Nevertheless, existing methods either typically require time-consuming fine-tuning (inefficient), fail to accomplish multiple semantic manipulations (poorly extensible), and/or lack support for different modality tasks (limited generalizability). Upon further investigation, we find that the geometric properties of noises in the diffusion model are strongly correlated with the semantic changes. Motivated by this, we propose a novel $\textit{GTF}$ for text-guided semantic manipulation, which has the following attractive capabilities: 1) $\textbf{Generalized}$: our $\textit{GTF}$ supports multiple semantic manipulations (e.g., addition, removal, and style transfer) and can be seamlessly integrated into all diffusion-based methods (i.e., Plug-and-play) across different modalities (i.e., modality-agnostic); and 2) $\textbf{Training-free}$: $\textit{GTF}$ produces high-fidelity results via simply controlling the geometric relationship between noises without tuning or optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, highlighting its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in semantics manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ayanami-yu.github.io/GTF-Project-Page/</p></details> |

We apply this capability to predict how wildfires spread, a task made difficult by the unpredictable nature of fire and the variety of environmental conditions it depends on. In this study, We present the first denoising diffusion model for predicting wildfire spread, a new kind of AI framework that learns to simulate fires not just as one fixed outcome, but as a range of possible scenarios. By doing so, it accounts for the inherent uncertainty of wildfire dynamics, a feature that traditional models typically fail to represent. Unlike deterministic approaches that generate a single prediction, our model produces ensembles of forecasts that reflect physically meaningful distributions of where fire might go next. This technology could help us develop smarter, faster, and more reliable tools for anticipating wildfire behavior, aiding decision-makers in fire risk assessment and response planning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we apply four generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process score. The other two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and observation data. We consider eight test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and quantification of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors. We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength. Results show that SDEdit generates unphysical fields, while DPS generates reasonable reconstructions at low computational cost but with smoothed fine-scale features. Both conditional approaches require re-training, but they reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with observations, and possess the correct statistics such as energy spectra. Further, their mean model errors are highly correlated with and predictable from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the trade-offs between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment in geophysical inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 23 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

In the context of brain MRIs, existing CA approaches rely on supervised contrastive learning or variational autoencoders (VAEs) using both healthy and unhealthy data, but such reliance on target samples is challenging in clinical settings. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) offers an alternative by learning a reference representation of healthy anatomy without the need for target samples. Deviations from this reference distribution can indicate potential anomalies. In this context, diffusion models have been increasingly adopted in UAD due to their superior performance in image generation compared to VAEs. Nonetheless, precisely reconstructing the anatomy of the brain remains a challenge. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework to improve the reconstruction quality by training a self-supervised contrastive encoder on healthy images to extract meaningful anatomical features. These features are used to condition a diffusion model to reconstruct the healthy appearance of a given image, enabling interpretable anomaly localization via pixel-wise comparison. We validate our approach through a proof-of-concept on a facial image dataset and further demonstrate its effectiveness on four brain MRI datasets, achieving state-of-the-art anomaly localization performance on the NOVA benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |

Collecting and labeling sufficient target domain data for model retraining represents an optimal solution, yet is limited by time and scarce resources. Active learning (AL) offers an efficient approach to reduce annotation costs while maintaining performance, but struggles to handle the challenge posed by distribution variations across different datasets. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised Active learning framework for Domain Adaptation, named ADAptation, which efficiently selects informative samples from multi-domain data pools under limited annotation budget. As a fundamental step, our method first utilizes the distribution homogenization capabilities of diffusion models to bridge cross-dataset gaps by translating target images into source-domain style. We then introduce two key innovations: (a) a hypersphere-constrained contrastive learning network for compact feature clustering, and (b) a dual-scoring mechanism that quantifies and balances sample uncertainty and representativeness. Extensive experiments on four breast ultrasound datasets (three public and one in-house/multi-center) across five common deep classifiers demonstrate that our method surpasses existing strong AL-based competitors, validating its effectiveness and generalization for clinical domain adaptation.

However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively.

While diffusion models have proven highly effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge. Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein, small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

To achieve semantic-correlated representation learning, our framework incorporates a latent diffusion model. The diffusion model learns the conditional generation process of the ground-truth segmentation map, resulting in ground-truth aware inference during the denoising process at the test stage. As our model is conditional, it is vital to ensure that the conditional variable contributes to the model output. We thus extensively model the contribution of the audio signal by minimizing the density ratio between the conditional probability of the multimodal data, e.g. conditioned on the audio-visual data, and that of the unimodal data, e.g. conditioned on the audio data only. In this way, our latent diffusion model via density ratio optimization explicitly maximizes the contribution of audio for AVS, which can then be achieved with contrastive learning as a constraint, where the diffusion part serves as the main objective to achieve maximum likelihood estimation, and the density ratio optimization part imposes the constraint. By adopting this latent diffusion model via contrastive learning, we effectively enhance the contribution of audio for AVS. The effectiveness of our solution is validated through experimental results on the benchmark dataset.

However, there are still challenges in performing multiple 3D inpainting tasks within a unified framework: 1) Single reference inpainting methods lack robustness when dealing with views that are far from the reference view. 2) Appearance inconsistency arises when independently inpainting multi-view images with 2D diffusion priors; 3) Geometry inconsistency limits performance when there are significant geometric changes in the inpainting regions. To tackle these challenges, we introduce DiGA3D, a novel and versatile 3D inpainting pipeline that leverages diffusion models to propagate consistent appearance and geometry in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, DiGA3D develops a robust strategy for selecting multiple reference views to reduce errors during propagation. Next, DiGA3D designs an Attention Feature Propagation (AFP) mechanism that propagates attention features from the selected reference views to other views via diffusion models to maintain appearance consistency. Furthermore, DiGA3D introduces a Texture-Geometry Score Distillation Sampling (TG-SDS) loss to further improve the geometric consistency of inpainted 3D scenes.

The purpose of \emph{partial label learning} (PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels associated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of diffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their potential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process. Therefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the perspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively refining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model to learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the generation uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label for classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch between instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a \emph{diffusion disambiguation model for PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information between instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial diffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to estimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated during the diffusion generation. During training, the ground-truth label is progressively refined, improving the classifier. Experiments show the advantage of the DDMP and its suitability for PLL.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we present MedDiff-FT, a controllable medical image generation method that fine-tunes a diffusion foundation model to produce medical images with structural dependency and domain specificity in a data-efficient manner. During inference, a dynamic adaptive guiding mask enforces spatial constraints to ensure anatomically coherent synthesis, while a lightweight stochastic mask generator enhances diversity through hierarchical randomness injection. Additionally, an automated quality assessment protocol filters suboptimal outputs using feature-space metrics, followed by mask corrosion to refine fidelity. Evaluated on five medical segmentation datasets,MedDiff-FT's synthetic image-mask pairs improve SOTA method's segmentation performance by an average of 1% in Dice score. The framework effectively balances generation quality, diversity, and computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for medical data augmentation.

In this paper, inspired by physical systems, we propose an energy-constrained diffusion model, which integrates the inductive bias of diffusion on manifolds with layer-wise constraints of energy minimization. We identify that the diffusion operators have a one-to-one correspondence with the energy functions implicitly descended by the diffusion process, and the finite-difference iteration for solving the energy-constrained diffusion system induces the propagation layers of various types of MPNNs operating on observed or latent structures. This leads to a unified mathematical framework for common neural architectures whose computational flows can be cast as message passing (or its special case), including MLPs, GNNs, and Transformers. Building on these insights, we devise a new class of neural message passing models, dubbed diffusion-inspired Transformers (DIFFormer), whose global attention layers are derived from the principled energy-constrained diffusion framework. Across diverse datasets ranging from real-world networks to images, texts, and physical particles, we demonstrate that the new model achieves promising performance in scenarios where the data structures are observed (as a graph), partially observed, or entirely unobserved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR).

Incorporating prior information from potential velocity distributions, well-log information, and our geological knowledge and expectations can significantly improve FWI convergence to a realistic model. While diffusion-regularized FWI has shown improved performance compared to conventional FWI by incorporating the velocity distribution prior, it can benefit even more by incorporating well-log information and other geological knowledge priors. To leverage this fact, we propose a geological class and well-information prior-assisted FWI using conditional diffusion models. This method seamlessly integrates multi-modal information into FWI, simultaneously achieving data fitting and universal geologic and geophysics prior matching, which is often not achieved with traditional regularization methods. Specifically, we propose to combine conditional diffusion models with FWI, where we integrate well-log data and geological class conditions into these conditional diffusion models using classifier-free guidance for multi-modal prior matching beyond the original velocity distribution prior. Numerical experiments on the OpenFWI datasets and field marine data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional FWI and the unconditional diffusion-regularized FWI.</p></details> |  |

We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets.

However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score-function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a task-dependent score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived exactly from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title changed, main text substantially revised, including new experiments, method acronym changed, references added. 34 pages, 11 figures, 2tables</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the ultimate measure of effectiveness is their successful transition from simulation to reality (sim2real). However, existing sim2real transfer methods struggle to comprehensively address the autonomy-oriented requirements of balancing: (i) conditioned domain adaptation, (ii) robust performance with limited examples, (iii) modularity in handling multiple domain representations, and (iv) real-time performance. To alleviate these pain points, we present a unified framework for learning cross-domain adaptive representations for sim2real transferable autonomous driving algorithms using conditional latent diffusion models. Our framework offers options to leverage: (i) alternate foundation models, (ii) a few-shot fine-tuning pipeline, and (iii) textual as well as image prompts for mapping across given source and target domains. It is also capable of generating diverse high-quality samples when diffusing across parameter spaces such as times of day, weather conditions, seasons, and operational design domains. We systematically analyze the presented framework and report our findings in the form of critical quantitative metrics and ablation studies, as well as insightful qualitative examples and remarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the serviceability of the proposed approach in bridging the sim2real gap for end-to-end autonomous driving using a behavioral cloning case study. Our experiments indicate that the proposed framework is capable of bridging the perceptual sim2real gap by over 40%. We hope that our approach underscores the potential of generative diffusion models in sim2real transfer, offering a pathway toward more robust and adaptive autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a training framework for feature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose two sampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and also enhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditioned on two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened style embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of Diffusion Models to encode pose/layout information in the content feature and semantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the sampling methods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking the conditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence between conditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation in our experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling for content and style features to further improve the performance. We also observe better controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods in image manipulation and image translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024; Code is available at https://github.com/WonwoongCho/Towards-Enhanced-Controllability-of-Diffusion-Models</p></details> |

Consequently, data availability and privacy protection are major obstacles to applying machine learning in medical imaging. To address this, our study proposes the Med-LSDM (Latent Semantic Diffusion Model), which operates directly in the 3D domain and leverages de-identified semantic maps to generate synthetic data as a method of privacy preservation and data augmentation. Unlike many existing methods that focus on generating 2D slices, Med-LSDM is designed specifically for 3D semantic image synthesis, making it well-suited for applications requiring full volumetric data. Med-LSDM incorporates a guiding mechanism that controls the 3D image generation process by applying a diffusion model within the latent space of a pre-trained VQ-GAN. By operating in the compressed latent space, the model significantly reduces computational complexity while still preserving critical 3D spatial details. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in 3D semantic medical image synthesis, achieving a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 on the conditional Duke Breast dataset and similar Dice scores (0.70964) to those of real images (0.71496). These results demonstrate that the synthetic data from our model have a small domain gap with real data and are useful for data augmentation.</p></details> |  |

There are practical considerations for creating a usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing level dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically assigned to generated levels so that the degree of overlap between input and output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability of the resulting levels. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration of charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds - against four generative techniques based on diffusion models, variational autoencoders, and large language models. Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange are better at generating novel materials that are stable, although many of these closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to substantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains computationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward more effective generative strategies for materials discovery. By establishing baselines for comparison, this work highlights opportunities for continued advancement of generative models, especially for the targeted generation of novel materials that are thermodynamically stable.</p></details> |  |

To this end, randomized smoothing provides theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making predictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small perturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a significant computational overhead during inference compared to classical methods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent space. Specifically, we use instance discrimination to achieve consistent representations along the trajectories by aligning temporally adjacent points. After fine-tuning based on the learned representations, our model enables implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, substantially reducing inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during inference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of diffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3% on average, with up to 11.6% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by 85$\times$ on average.

However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning. This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end planners on NAVSIM benchmarks.

Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale, which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation. Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance, offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://annealing-guidance.github.io/annealing-guidance/</p></details> |

Prior works related to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way.

This result applies to a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases -- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed in previous work.

To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments.

We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled.

To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VMoBA</p></details> |

While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image. To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference, we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference, enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods focus on the integration of diverse generative information into controlling inputs, utilizing frameworks such as GLIGEN or ControlNet, to produce commendable outcomes in controllable generation. However, such approaches intrinsically restrict generation performance to the learning capacities of predefined network architectures. In this paper, we explore the innovative integration of controlling information and introduce PerLDiff (\textbf{Per}spective-\textbf{L}ayout \textbf{Diff}usion Models), a novel method for effective street view image generation that fully leverages perspective 3D geometric information. Our PerLDiff employs 3D geometric priors to guide the generation of street view images with precise object-level control within the network learning process, resulting in a more robust and controllable output. Moreover, it demonstrates superior controllability compared to alternative layout control methods.

Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> |  |

To circumvent these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity. We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile, despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.</p></details> |  |

This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2) generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance. Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench, a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150 individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark for video identity customization.

Intermediate representations from diffusion models can be leveraged for downstream visual tasks, while self-supervised vision models can enhance the convergence and generation quality of diffusion models. However, transferring pretrained weights from vision models to diffusion models is challenging due to input mismatches and the use of latent spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Unified Self-supervised Pretraining (USP), a framework that initializes diffusion models via masked latent modeling in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent space. USP achieves comparable performance in understanding tasks while significantly improving the convergence speed and generation quality of diffusion models.

While generative approaches have addressed this challenge by leveraging priors from internet-scale datasets, with recent studies showing state-of-the-art results using fine-tuned text-to-image diffusion models, there is still room for improvement. Notably, autoregressive generative approaches, particularly Visual AutoRegressive modeling, have demonstrated superior results compared to diffusion models in conditioned image synthesis, while offering faster inference times. In this work, we apply Visual Autoregressive Transformer (VAR) to the monocular depth estimation problem. However, the conventional GPT-2-style training procedure (teacher forcing) inherited by VAR yields suboptimal results for depth estimation. To address this limitation, we introduce DepthART - a novel training method formulated as a Depth Autoregressive Refinement Task. Unlike traditional VAR training with static inputs and targets, our method implements a dynamic target formulation based on model outputs, enabling self-refinement. By utilizing the model's own predictions as inputs instead of ground truth token maps during training, we frame the objective as residual minimization, effectively reducing the discrepancy between training and inference procedures. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed training approach significantly enhances the performance of VAR in depth estimation tasks. When trained on Hypersim dataset using our approach, the model achieves superior results across multiple unseen benchmarks compared to existing generative and discriminative baselines.</p></details> |  |

As the latest generative models, diffusion models (DMs) have struggled to produce high-fidelity images due to their stochastic nature in image domains. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) yield both compact and detailed prior knowledge in latent domains, which could effectively guide the model towards more effective learning of the original data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) provided by pre-trained LDMs to enhance data consistency in MRI reconstruction tasks. Specifically, we first construct a Visual-Mamba-based backbone, which enables efficient encoding and reconstruction of under-sampled images. Then pre-trained LDMs are integrated to provide conditional priors in both latent and image domains. A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion in multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior in both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with generated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for self-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we propose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration signal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the "1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

This contrasts with signal processing techniques, such as Fourier and wavelet analyses, which often employ hierarchical decompositions. Inspired by such principles, particularly the idea of signal separation, we introduce a diffusion framework leveraging multi-scale latent factorization. Our framework uniquely decomposes the denoising target, typically latent features from a pretrained Variational Autoencoder, into a low-frequency base signal capturing core structural information and a high-frequency residual signal that contributes finer, high-frequency details like textures. This decomposition into base and residual components directly informs our two-stage image generation process, which first produces the low-resolution base, followed by the generation of the high-resolution residual. Our proposed architecture facilitates reduced sampling steps during the residual learning stage, owing to the inherent ease of modeling residual information, which confers advantages over conventional full-resolution generation techniques. This specific approach of decomposing the signal into a base and a residual, conceptually akin to how wavelet analysis can separate different frequency bands, yields a more streamlined and intuitive design distinct from generic hierarchical models. Our method, \name\ (Multi-Scale Factorization), demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving FID scores of 2.08 ($256\times256$) and 2.47 ($512\times512$) on class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks, outperforming the DiT baseline (2.27 and 3.04 respectively) while also delivering a $4\times$ speed-up with the same number of sampling steps.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a novel mask-guided GenAI approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic fetal head ultrasound images paired with segmentation masks. These synthetic pairs augment real datasets for supervised fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our results show that the synthetic data captures real image features effectively, and this approach reaches state-of-the-art fetal head segmentation, especially when trained with a limited number of real image-mask pairs. In particular, the segmentation reaches Dice Scores of 94.66\% and 94.38\% using a handful of ultrasound images from the Spanish and African cohorts, respectively.

In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts) into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving 100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios: each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome. These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> |

However, these approaches face significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1) We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8 to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame; subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image SR show surprising fine details.</p></details> | ICCV, 2025 |

However, we argue that video depth estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints. Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis, highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance, showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done in Nov 2024, during an internship at the University of Pennsylvania.

Although some methods decompose the task into bone length and bone direction prediction based on the human anatomical skeleton to explicitly incorporate more human body prior constraints, the performance of these methods is significantly lower than that of the SOTA diffusion-based methods. This can be attributed to the tree structure of the human skeleton. Direct application of the disentangled method could amplify the accumulation of hierarchical errors, propagating through each hierarchy. Meanwhile, the hierarchical information has not been fully explored by the previous methods. To address these problems, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method with Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser is proposed, termed DDHPose. In our approach: (1) We disentangle the 3D pose and diffuse the bone length and bone direction during the forward process of the diffusion model to effectively model the human pose prior. A disentanglement loss is proposed to supervise diffusion model learning. (2) For the reverse process, we propose Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser (HSTDenoiser) to improve the hierarchical modeling of each joint. Our HSTDenoiser comprises two components: the Hierarchical-Related Spatial Transformer (HRST) and the Hierarchical-Related Temporal Transformer (HRTT). HRST exploits joint spatial information and the influence of the parent joint on each joint for spatial modeling, while HRTT utilizes information from both the joint and its hierarchical adjacent joints to explore the hierarchical temporal correlations among joints.

Our highlights are: 1) we develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text) guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA diagnosis.

While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views. Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.</p></details> |  |

Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data, which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos, achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://becauseimbatman0.github.io/ViewPoint</p></details> |

However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Standard Computer Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01955v1)** | 2025-07-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.01955v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc). The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework. We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://fm-vision-evals.epfl.ch/</p></details> |

In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document understanding. We open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably, GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong capabilities.

Although recent work has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new concept, {\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks, we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12 distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together, our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.

Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this, we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples, thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness. Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained analyses of model-specific weaknesses.

A general scenario is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using a simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness of agents, our findings first indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions. Furthermore, we implement an adversarial environment injection and analyze the approach to improve faithfulness, calling for a collective focus on this important topic.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

However, this integration also introduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal jailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods, including Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety Tuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs' built-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of multimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger jailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven multimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing heavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive analysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in MLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers are responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of precisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety tuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by this, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense framework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while restoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional computational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs while preserving efficiency. Extensive evaluations across three MLLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate SafePTR's state-of-the-art performance in mitigating jailbreak risks without compromising utility.</p></details> |  |

These models often fail to fully leverage visual input, defaulting to strong language priors. Our approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual insights actively guide language generation. We demonstrate the superior multimodal understanding of our resultant model through a detailed upstream analysis quantifying its ability to predict visually-dependent tokens as well as 10 pt boost on visually challenging tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ChartCoder}, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Chart2Code-160k}, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for chart-to-code generation, and propose the \textbf{Snippet-of-Thought (SoT)} method, which transforms direct chart-to-code generation data into step-by-step generation. Experiments demonstrate that ChartCoder, with only 7B parameters, surpasses existing open-source MLLMs on chart-to-code benchmarks, achieving superior chart restoration and code excitability.

To solve these problems, we introduce SCADF-MoE, a spatial-context aware dynamic fusion network built on a soft mixture-of-experts backbone. SCADF-MoE first clusters neighboring points into short trajectories to inject explicit spatial context. Then, it adaptively fuses channel state information, angle of arrival profile, distance, and gain through its learnable MoE router, so that the most reliable cues dominate at each carrier band. The fused representation is fed to a modality-task MoE that simultaneously regresses the coordinates of every vertex in the trajectory and its centroid, thereby exploiting inter-point correlations. Finally, an auxiliary maximum-mean-discrepancy loss enforces expert diversity and mitigates gradient interference, stabilizing multi-task training. On three real urban layouts and three carrier bands (2.6, 6, 28 GHz), the model delivers consistent sub-meter MSE and halves unseen-NLOS error versus the best prior work. To our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages large-scale multimodal MoE for frequency-robust ISAC localization.</p></details> |  |

While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.</p></details> |  |

However, predicting post popularity remains challenging due to the complex interplay between visual, textual, temporal, and user behavioral factors. This paper presents HyperFusion, a hierarchical multimodal ensemble learning framework for social media popularity prediction. Our approach employs a three-tier fusion architecture that progressively integrates features across abstraction levels: visual representations from CLIP encoders, textual embeddings from transformer models, and temporal-spatial metadata with user characteristics. The framework implements a hierarchical ensemble strategy combining CatBoost, TabNet, and custom multi-layer perceptrons. To address limited labeled data, we propose a two-stage training methodology with pseudo-labeling and iterative refinement. We introduce novel cross-modal similarity measures and hierarchical clustering features that capture inter-modal dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperFusion achieves competitive performance on the SMP challenge dataset. Our team achieved third place in the SMP Challenge 2025 (Image Track).

These challenges highlight the necessity for a robust and efficient multimodal UAV object detection method. Mamba has demonstrated considerable potential in multimodal image fusion. Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a multimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To improve geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block (DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from deformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions, which serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal feature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared (IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba Block for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature fusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for small objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale feature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba (DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to the SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features. In particular, we employ cross-enhanced spatial attention before the DTMB and cross-channel attention after the Fusion Mamba Block to extract more discriminative features. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset show that our method outperforms the baseline OAFA method by 3.6% in the mAP metric.

However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output controllability, and dynamic, response-aware perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. Recently, a growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10x acceleration in inference speed. The advancement of discrete diffusion LLMs and MLLMs has been largely driven by progress in two domains. The first is the development of autoregressive LLMs and MLLMs, which has accumulated vast amounts of data, benchmarks, and foundational infrastructure for training and inference. The second contributing domain is the evolution of the mathematical models underlying discrete diffusion. Together, these advancements have catalyzed a surge in dLLMs and dMLLMs research in early 2025. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training and inference, and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment. Paper collection: https://github.com/LiQiiiii/DLLM-Survey</p></details> |  |

This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace.

However, most approaches focus on aligning images and text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR (Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Attempts to create multimodal and multi-disease models have resulted in inconsistent clinical accuracy. Furthermore, training these models typically requires large, labour-intensive, well-labelled datasets. We developed MerMED-FM, a state-of-the-art multimodal, multi-specialty foundation model trained using self-supervised learning and a memory module. MerMED-FM was trained on 3.3 million medical images from over ten specialties and seven modalities, including computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays (CXR), ultrasound (US), pathology patches, color fundus photography (CFP), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and dermatology images. MerMED-FM was evaluated across multiple diseases and compared against existing foundational models. Strong performance was achieved across all modalities, with AUROCs of 0.988 (OCT); 0.982 (pathology); 0.951 (US); 0.943 (CT); 0.931 (skin); 0.894 (CFP); 0.858 (CXR). MerMED-FM has the potential to be a highly adaptable, versatile, cross-specialty foundation model that enables robust medical imaging interpretation across diverse medical disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 3 composite figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Although LLMs demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, their efficiency in processing tabular data remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of both text-based and multimodal LLMs on table understanding tasks through a cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation. Specifically, we compare their performance on tables from scientific vs. non-scientific contexts and examine their robustness on tables represented as images vs. text. Additionally, we conduct an interpretability analysis to measure context usage and input relevance. We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables from scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table is provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX. Our findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table modalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.</p></details> | <details><summary>TRL@A...</summary><p>TRL@ACL 2025, camera-ready version</p></details> |

Recent studies either develop tool-using or unify specific visual tasks into the autoregressive framework, often at the expense of overall multimodal performance. To address this issue and enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, we propose Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that utilizes differentiable task preferences derived from typical fine-grained visual tasks. TPO introduces learnable task tokens that establish connections between multiple task-specific heads and the MLLM. By leveraging rich visual labels during training, TPO significantly enhances the MLLM's multimodal capabilities and task-specific performance. Through multi-task co-training within TPO, we observe synergistic benefits that elevate individual task performance beyond what is achievable through single-task training methodologies. Our instantiation of this approach with VideoChat and LLaVA demonstrates an overall 14.6% improvement in multimodal performance compared to baseline models. Additionally, MLLM-TPO demonstrates robust zero-shot capabilities across various tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models. The code will be released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/TPO</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios. FALCON demonstrates superior performance with a remarkable 9-fold reduction in visual tokens.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes a behaviour-aware multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT) summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics. Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed video summaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to HHAI WS 2025: Workshops at the Fourth International Conference on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI)</p></details> |

We present a framework that unifies multimodal understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable and efficient multimodal foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world data often exhibits shared relations beyond simple pairwise associations. We propose M3CoL, a Multimodal Mixup Contrastive Learning approach to capture nuanced shared relations inherent in multimodal data. Our key contribution is a Mixup-based contrastive loss that learns robust representations by aligning mixed samples from one modality with their corresponding samples from other modalities thereby capturing shared relations between them. For multimodal classification tasks, we introduce a framework that integrates a fusion module with unimodal prediction modules for auxiliary supervision during training, complemented by our proposed Mixup-based contrastive loss. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets (N24News, ROSMAP, BRCA, and Food-101), we demonstrate that M3CoL effectively captures shared multimodal relations and generalizes across domains. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on N24News, ROSMAP, and BRCA, while achieving comparable performance on Food-101. Our work highlights the significance of learning shared relations for robust multimodal learning, opening up promising avenues for future research.

However, these advancements also raise critical concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other security threats. Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view imagery. Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to $49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues from visual data. Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text, architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate associated risks.

Traditional object detection methods utilize either only 2D images from cameras or 3D data from lidars or similar 3D sensors. However, each of these sensors have weaknesses and limitations. Cameras do not have depth perception and 3D sensors typically do not carry color information. These weaknesses can undermine the reliability and robustness of industrial manufacturing systems. To address these challenges, this work proposes a multi-sensor system combining an red-green-blue (RGB) camera and a 3D point cloud sensor. The two sensors are calibrated for precise alignment of the multimodal data captured from the two hardware devices. A novel multimodal object detection method is developed to process both RGB and depth data. This object detector is based on the Faster R-CNN baseline that was originally designed to process only camera images. The results show that the multimodal model significantly outperforms the depth-only and RGB-only baselines on established object detection metrics. More specifically, the multimodal model improves mAP by 13% and raises Mean Precision by 11.8% in comparison to the RGB-only baseline. Compared to the depth-only baseline, it improves mAP by 78% and raises Mean Precision by 57%. Hence, this method facilitates more reliable and robust object detection in service to smart manufacturing applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose a self-supervised pre-training approach to gesture representation learning that grounds body movements in spoken language. Our experiments show that the learned embeddings align with expert annotations and have significant predictive power. Moreover, reference resolution accuracy further improves when (1) using multimodal gesture representations, even when speech is unavailable at inference time, and (2) leveraging dialogue history. Overall, our findings highlight the complementary roles of gesture and speech in reference resolution, offering a step towards more naturalistic models of human-machine interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |

Existing MERC methods face several challenges: (1) they fail to fully harness direct inter-modal cues, possibly leading to less-than-thorough cross-modal modeling; (2) they concurrently extract information from the same and different modalities at each network layer, potentially triggering conflicts from the fusion of multi-source data; (3) they lack the agility required to detect dynamic sentimental changes, perhaps resulting in inaccurate classification of utterances with abrupt sentiment shifts. To address these issues, a novel approach named GraphSmile is proposed for tracking intricate emotional cues in multimodal dialogues. GraphSmile comprises two key components, i.e., GSF and SDP modules. GSF ingeniously leverages graph structures to alternately assimilate inter-modal and intra-modal emotional dependencies layer by layer, adequately capturing cross-modal cues while effectively circumventing fusion conflicts. SDP is an auxiliary task to explicitly delineate the sentiment dynamics between utterances, promoting the model's ability to distinguish sentimental discrepancies. GraphSmile is effortlessly applied to multimodal sentiment analysis in conversation (MSAC), thus enabling simultaneous execution of MERC and MSAC tasks. Empirical results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GraphSmile can handle complex emotional and sentimental patterns, significantly outperforming baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Prior studies apply Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) in language modeling to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees. However, these methods typically rely on internal model logits or are restricted to multiple-choice settings, which hampers their generalizability and adaptability in dynamic, open-ended environments. In this paper, we introduce TRON, a two-step framework for risk control and assessment, applicable to any MLLM that supports sampling in both open-ended and closed-ended scenarios. TRON comprises two main components: (1) a novel conformal score to sample response sets of minimum size, and (2) a nonconformity score to identify high-quality responses based on self-consistency theory, controlling the error rates by two specific risk levels. Furthermore, we investigate semantic redundancy in prediction sets within open-ended contexts for the first time, leading to a promising evaluation metric for MLLMs based on average set size. Our comprehensive experiments across four Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) datasets utilizing eight MLLMs show that TRON achieves desired error rates bounded by two user-specified risk levels. Additionally, deduplicated prediction sets maintain adaptiveness while being more efficient and stable for risk assessment under different risk levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025 Spotlights</p></details> |

Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively, where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods, showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color, shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc).

In the emerging field of machine unlearning, existing methodologies struggle to remove patient data from trained multimodal architectures, which are widely used in healthcare. We propose Forget-MI, a novel machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, by establishing loss functions and perturbation techniques. Our approach unlearns unimodal and joint representations of the data requested to be forgotten while preserving knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining comparable performance to the original model. We evaluate our results using performance on the forget dataset, performance on the test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack (MIA), which measures the attacker's ability to distinguish the forget dataset from the training dataset. Our model outperforms the existing approaches that aim to reduce MIA and the performance on the forget dataset while keeping an equivalent performance on the test set. Specifically, our approach reduces MIA by 0.202 and decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305, respectively. Additionally, our performance on the test set matches that of the retrained model, while allowing forgetting. Code is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/Forget-MI.git</p></details> |  |

Building on an annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task, we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements. Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in visual-textual content.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, current approaches face three key limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with both model size and training data on MMEB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://haon-chen.github.io/MoCa/</p></details> |

However, growing concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias, particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle, interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for future bias mitigation.</p></details> |  |

Can they hop around multimodal websites to complete complex user tasks? Existing benchmarks fail to assess them in a realistic, evolving environment for their embodiment across websites. To answer this question, we present MMInA, a multihop and multimodal benchmark to evaluate the embodied agents for compositional Internet tasks, with several appealing properties: 1) Evolving real-world multimodal websites. Our benchmark uniquely operates on evolving real-world websites, ensuring a high degree of realism and applicability to natural user tasks. Our data includes 1,050 human-written tasks covering various domains such as shopping and travel, with each task requiring the agent to extract multimodal information from web pages as observations autonomously; 2) Multihop web browsing. Our dataset features naturally compositional tasks that require information from or actions on multiple websites to solve, to assess long-range reasoning capabilities on web tasks; 3) Holistic evaluation. We propose a novel protocol for evaluating an agent's progress in completing multihop tasks. We experiment with both standalone (multimodal) language models and heuristic-based web agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while long-chain multihop web tasks are easy for humans, they remain challenging for state-of-the-art web agents. We identify that agents are more likely to fail on the early hops when solving tasks with more hops, which results in lower task success rates. To address this issue, we propose a simple memory augmentation approach that replays past action trajectories to reflect. Our method significantly improves the performance of both the single-hop and multihop web browsing abilities.

Existing tokenizers treat medical codes from EHRs as isolated textual tokens. However, each medical code is defined by its textual description, its position in ontological hierarchies, and its relationships to other codes, such as disease co-occurrences and drug-treatment associations. Medical vocabularies contain more than 600,000 codes with critical information for clinical reasoning. We introduce MedTok, a multimodal medical code tokenizer that uses the text descriptions and relational context of codes. MedTok processes text using a language model encoder and encodes the relational structure with a graph encoder. It then quantizes both modalities into a unified token space, preserving modality-specific and cross-modality information. We integrate MedTok into five EHR models and evaluate it on operational and clinical tasks across in-patient and out-patient datasets, including outcome prediction, diagnosis classification, drug recommendation, and risk stratification. Swapping standard EHR tokenizers with MedTok improves AUPRC across all EHR models, by 4.10% on MIMIC-III, 4.78% on MIMIC-IV, and 11.32% on EHRShot, with the largest gains in drug recommendation. Beyond EHR modeling, we demonstrate using MedTok tokenizer with medical QA systems. Our results demonstrate the potential of MedTok as a unified tokenizer for medical codes, improving tokenization for medical foundation models.</p></details> | ICML'25 |

To address limitations in existing BKGs, we present PrimeKG++, an enriched knowledge graph incorporating multimodal data, including biological sequences and textual descriptions for each entity type. By combining semantic and relational information in a unified representation, our approach demonstrates strong generalizability, enabling accurate link predictions even for unseen nodes.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MusiXQA, the first comprehensive dataset for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in music sheet understanding. MusiXQA features high-quality synthetic music sheets generated via MusiXTeX, with structured annotations covering note pitch and duration, chords, clefs, key/time signatures, and text, enabling diverse visual QA tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we reveal significant limitations of current state-of-the-art MLLMs in this domain. Beyond benchmarking, we developed Phi-3-MusiX, an MLLM fine-tuned on our dataset, achieving significant performance gains over GPT-based methods.

However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE -- all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0% accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.</p></details> |  |

Existing work lacks sufficient experimentation on the importance of each modality in the instruction tuning stage, often using a majority of vision-language data while keeping text-only data limited and fixing mixtures of modalities. By incorporating diverse text-only data in the visual instruction tuning stage, we vary vision-language data in various controlled experiments to investigate the importance of modality in visual instruction tuning. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that the text-heavy instruction tuning approach is able to perform on-par with traditional vision-heavy mixtures on both modalities across 12 general datasets while using as low as half the total training tokens. We find that simply increasing sufficiently diverse text-only data enables transfer of instruction following ability and domain knowledge across modalities while being more efficient than the vision-language approach.</p></details> |  |

Such content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection, and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic, multilingual misinformation detection.

Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment. However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information. Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%.

We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2) adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3) hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4) context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement) and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal representations through structured text.</p></details> |  |

They achieve this by learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained, score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the influence of multiple dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions.</p></details> |  |

Like professionals in the creative industries, such generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present ThinkSound, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce AudioCoT, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.

This step negatively affects key Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as time to first token (TTFT) and time per output token (TPOT). We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our approach decouples these steps, unlocking new opportunities and optimizations. These include a mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a novel way to parallelize the encoding load within a request, a module for optimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel role-switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15x lower peak memory utilization), batch sizes (up to 22x larger), 10x more images per request, and 2.2x larger KV caches. Furthermore, it leads to significant improvements in SLO attainment (up to 90-100% improvement) and TTFT (up to 71% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate.

To address this challenge, we introduce Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones.

While effective for computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain. We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence (up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally grounded foundation models for materials science.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Crab, the first agent benchmark framework designed to support cross-environment tasks, incorporating a graph-based fine-grained evaluation method and an efficient mechanism for task and evaluator construction. Our framework supports multiple devices and can be easily extended to any environment with a Python interface. Leveraging Crab, we developed a cross-platform Crab Benchmark-v0 comprising 120 tasks in computer desktop and mobile phone environments.

In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence. In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals. Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional federated learning (FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities. Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att, which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Integrating cover crops (CC) offers multiple benefits, including soil erosion reduction, weed suppression, decreased nitrogen requirements, and enhanced carbon sequestration, all of which are closely tied to the aboveground biomass (AGB) they produce. However, biomass production varies significantly due to microsite variability, making accurate estimation and mapping essential for identifying zones of poor weed suppression and optimizing targeted management strategies. To address this challenge, developing a comprehensive CC map, including its AGB distribution, will enable informed decision-making regarding weed control methods and optimal application rates. Manual visual inspection is impractical and labor-intensive, especially given the extensive field size and the wide diversity and variation of weed species and sizes. In this context, optical imagery and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are two prominent sources with unique characteristics that enhance AGB estimation. This study introduces a ground robot-mounted multimodal sensor system designed for agricultural field mapping. The system integrates optical and LiDAR data, leveraging machine learning (ML) methods for data fusion to improve biomass predictions. The best ML-based model for dry AGB estimation achieved a coefficient of determination value of 0.88, demonstrating robust performance in diverse field conditions.

A multimode shortest path is the shortest path using one of multiple `modes' of transportation that cannot be combined. This represents real-world scenarios where different modes are not combinable, such as flights operated by different airlines. More precisely, a $k$-multimode graph is a collection of $k$ graphs on the same vertex set and the $k$-mode distance between two vertices is defined as the minimum among the distances computed in each individual graph. We focus on approximating fundamental graph parameters on these graphs, specifically diameter and radius. In undirected multimode graphs we first show an elegant linear time 3-approximation algorithm for 2-mode diameter. We then extend this idea into a general subroutine that can be used as a part of any $\alpha$-approximation, and use it to construct a 2 and 2.5 approximation algorithm for 2-mode diameter. For undirected radius, we introduce a general scheme that can compute a 3-approximation of the $k$-mode radius for any $k$. In the directed case we develop novel techniques to construct a linear time algorithm to determine whether the diameter is finite. We also develop many conditional fine-grained lower bounds for various multimode diameter and radius approximation problems. We are able to show that many of our algorithms are tight under popular fine-grained complexity hypotheses, including our linear time 3-approximation for $3$-mode undirected diameter and radius. As part of this effort we propose the first extension to the Hitting Set Hypothesis [SODA'16], which we call the $\ell$-Hitting Set Hypothesis. We use this hypothesis to prove the first parameterized lower bound tradeoff for radius approximation algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unified frameworks that integrate these tasks. The emergence of GPT-4o's new capabilities exemplifies this trend, highlighting the potential for unification. However, the architectural differences between the two domains pose significant challenges. To provide a clear overview of current efforts toward unification, we present a comprehensive survey aimed at guiding future research. First, we introduce the foundational concepts and recent advancements in multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation models. Next, we review existing unified models, categorizing them into three main architectural paradigms: diffusion-based, autoregressive-based, and hybrid approaches that fuse autoregressive and diffusion mechanisms. For each category, we analyze the structural designs and innovations introduced by related works. Additionally, we compile datasets and benchmarks tailored for unified models, offering resources for future exploration.

Jailbreak attacks are red teaming methods that aim to bypass safety mechanisms and discover MLLMs' potential risks. Existing MLLMs' jailbreak methods often bypass the model's safety mechanism through complex optimization methods or carefully designed image and text prompts. Despite achieving some progress, they have a low attack success rate on commercial closed-source MLLMs. Unlike previous research, we empirically find that there exists a Shuffle Inconsistency between MLLMs' comprehension ability and safety ability for the shuffled harmful instruction. That is, from the perspective of comprehension ability, MLLMs can understand the shuffled harmful text-image instructions well. However, they can be easily bypassed by the shuffled harmful instructions from the perspective of safety ability, leading to harmful responses. Then we innovatively propose a text-image jailbreak attack named SI-Attack. Specifically, to fully utilize the Shuffle Inconsistency and overcome the shuffle randomness, we apply a query-based black-box optimization method to select the most harmful shuffled inputs based on the feedback of the toxic judge model. A series of experiments show that SI-Attack can improve the attack's performance on three benchmarks. In particular, SI-Attack can obviously improve the attack success rate for commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o or Claude-3.5-Sonnet.</p></details> | ICCV2025 |

While multimodal MRI offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions, existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of joint modeling for integrated predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>2nd S...</summary><p>2nd Sorbonne-Heidelberg Workshop on AI in medicine: Machine Learning for multi-modal data</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose the Federated Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness, semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, multimodal frameworks often entangle these representations, limiting interpretability and potentially suppressing discriminative features. To address this, we propose Disentangled and Interpretable Multimodal Attention Fusion (DIMAF), a multimodal framework that separates the intra- and inter-modal interactions within an attention-based fusion mechanism to learn distinct modality-specific and modality-shared representations. We introduce a loss based on Distance Correlation to promote disentanglement between these representations and integrate Shapley additive explanations to assess their relative contributions to survival prediction. We evaluate DIMAF on four public cancer survival datasets, achieving a relative average improvement of 1.85% in performance and 23.7% in disentanglement compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal models. Beyond improved performance, our interpretable framework enables a deeper exploration of the underlying interactions between and within modalities in cancer biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables.

Current research largely emphasizes post-hoc correction or model-specific fine-tuning strategies, with limited exploration of preprocessing techniques to address hallucination issues at the input stage. This study presents a novel ensemble-based preprocessing framework that adaptively selects the most appropriate filtering approach -- noise reduced (NR), edge enhanced (EE), or unaltered input (org) based on the type of question posed, resulting into reduced hallucination without requiring any modifications to the underlying model architecture or training pipeline. Evaluated on the `HaloQuest' dataset -- a benchmark designed to test multimodal reasoning on visually complex inputs, our method achieves a 44.3% reduction in hallucination rates, as measured by Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores using SelfCheckGPT. This demonstrates that intelligent input conditioning alone can significantly enhance factual grounding in LLM responses. The findings highlight the importance of adaptive preprocessing techniques in mitigating hallucinations, paving the way for more reliable multimodal systems capable of addressing real-world challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review in NCAA Springer, 21 pages, 4 figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

Current evaluation methodologies show notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8 major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions, systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation, automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning. For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2% accuracy in the proposed PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and multimodal understanding.

This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules: Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists. Participants praised the system's real-time previews and intuitive controls, though they requested finer narrative editing tools. TaleForge advances multimodal storytelling by aligning personalized text and imagery to create immersive, user-centric experiences.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing: single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points) for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each type.

However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from temporally-aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction, egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric video, and also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research.

Moreover, including data from both participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial interactions.

Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula) and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML, Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of 1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA, WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages and 11 figures</p></details> |

Clinicians routinely encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias, i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks from context.</p></details> |  |

However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3) Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the need for specialized training in agent reward modeling.

However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

The ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set.

This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

However, previous studies often involve complex training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network (LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features at both global and local levels based on attention information from different modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation. Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively, while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%.

Despite their success, current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained model and minimizing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICCV2025</p></details> |

Yet, a score fails to describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability. Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models (LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue. The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data. Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline. Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video LMMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Existing face-based methods struggle with robustness and generalization due to data quality constraints, while text prompt methods offer limited diversity and fine-grained control. Although multimodal approaches aim to integrate various modalities, their reliance on fully matched training data significantly constrains their performance and applicability. This paper proposes a 3-stage multimodal controllable speech synthesis framework to address these challenges. For face encoder, we use supervised learning and knowledge distillation to tackle generalization issues. Furthermore, the text encoder is trained on both text-face and text-speech data to enhance the diversity of the generated speech. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms single-modal baseline methods in both face based and text prompt based speech synthesis, highlighting its effectiveness in generating high-quality speech.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |

However, existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems predominantly rely on single-modal sensors as primary participants, which leads to a limited representation of environmental features and significant performance bottlenecks under the emerging requirements of 6G applications. This limitation motivates a paradigm shift from single-modal to multimodal ISAC. In this article, we first analyze the key challenges in realizing multimodal ISAC, including the fusion of heterogeneous multimodal data, the high communication overhead among distributed sensors, and the design of efficient and scalable system architectures. We then introduce several enabling technologies, such as large AI models, semantic communication, and multi-agent systems, that hold promise for addressing these challenges. To operationalize these technologies, we zoom into three architectural paradigms: fusion-based multimodal ISAC (F-MAC), interaction-based multimodal ISAC (I-MAC), and relay-based multimodal ISAC (R-MAC), each tailored to organize devices and modalities for efficient collaboration in different scenarios. Thereafter, a case study is presented based on the F-MAC scheme, demonstrating that the scheme achieves more comprehensive sensing and improves sensing accuracy by approximately 80% compared to conventional single-modal ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss several open issues to be addressed in the future.</p></details> |  |

First, we develop a data synthesis strategy tailored to document scenarios in which we build a diverse dataset to improve the model generalization. Then, we apply a few training techniques, including dynamic proportional sampling, data preprocessing, and OCR postprocessing strategies.

For instance, a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions. Despite some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to address this issue. In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere visual inspection. Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection, localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant). SIDA not only discerns the authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria. Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior performance among diversified settings. The code, model, and dataset will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version revises and corrects the metric calculations in the tables</p></details> |

Enhancing Zero-Shot Image Classification with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15668v5)** | 2025-06-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.15668v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been effectively used for many computer vision tasks, including image classification. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

Answering questions over such content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text, tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint Copy |

Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code, datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this field.

Trivial and repeatable tasks; e.g., sample transportation for analysis and vial capping are well-suited for robots; if done successfully and reliably, chemists could contribute their efforts towards more critical research activities. Currently, robots can perform these tasks faster than chemists, but how reliable are they? Improper capping could result in human exposure to toxic chemicals which could be fatal. To ensure that robots perform these tasks as accurately as humans, sensory feedback is required to assess the progress of task execution. To address this, we propose a novel methodology based on behaviour trees with multimodal perception. Along with automating robotic tasks, this methodology also verifies the successful execution of the task, a fundamental requirement in safety-critical environments. The experimental evaluation was conducted on two lab tasks: sample vial capping and laboratory rack insertion. The results show high success rate, i.e., 88% for capping and 92% for insertion, along with strong error detection capabilities. This ultimately proves the robustness and reliability of our approach and that using multimodal behaviour trees should pave the way towards the next generation of robotic chemists.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, accepted and presented in ICRA 2025</p></details> |

It jointly learns the implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs, our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera domain.

Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high training costs or suffer from degraded language capabilities when adapting pretrained models. To address this, we propose Soft ModalityAware Routing (SMAR), a novel regularization technique that uses Kullback Leibler divergence to control routing probability distributions across modalities, encouraging expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text, outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance. Our approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.</p></details> |  |

While datasets for emotion analysis in languages such as English have proliferated, there remains a pressing need for high-quality, comprehensive datasets tailored to the unique linguistic, cultural, and multimodal characteristics of Chinese. In this work, we propose \textbf{EmotionTalk}, an interactive Chinese multimodal emotion dataset with rich annotations. This dataset provides multimodal information from 19 actors participating in dyadic conversational settings, incorporating acoustic, visual, and textual modalities. It includes 23.6 hours of speech (19,250 utterances), annotations for 7 utterance-level emotion categories (happy, surprise, sad, disgust, anger, fear, and neutral), 5-dimensional sentiment labels (negative, weakly negative, neutral, weakly positive, and positive) and 4-dimensional speech captions (speaker, speaking style, emotion and overall). The dataset is well-suited for research on unimodal and multimodal emotion recognition, missing modality challenges, and speech captioning tasks. To our knowledge, it represents the first high-quality and versatile Chinese dialogue multimodal emotion dataset, which is a valuable contribution to research on cross-cultural emotion analysis and recognition. Additionally, we conduct experiments on EmotionTalk to demonstrate the effectiveness and quality of the dataset. It will be open-source and freely available for all academic purposes.

Existing codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a 500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics. This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models, depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include: (1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2) the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at https://github.com/zgg2577/VS-KC.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

Mitigating OCR Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20168v1)** | 2025-06-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.20168v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However, existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models' capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks, highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we tackle exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an exemplar pair to a content image(s), by leveraging pretrained text-to-image diffusion models and multimodal VLMs. Even though our end-to-end pipeline is optimization-free, our experiments demonstrate that it still outperforms baselines on multiple types of edits while being ~4x faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024 (AI4VA Workshop)</p></details> |

However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10pages |

No-reference image quality measures are often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and code are publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388429.</p></details> |  |

However, practical instrumentation and geometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the imaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data, produce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not consider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution is crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by the low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser technology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by characterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to improve dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and enhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input. Specifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as implicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the network are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the need for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong implicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit regularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms traditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions, effectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.</p></details> |  |

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond.

The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |

Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.13080v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
