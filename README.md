| **[Topo4D: Topology-Preserving Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity 4D Head Capture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00440v3)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D head capture aims to generate dynamic topological meshes and corresponding texture maps from videos, which is widely utilized in movies and games for its ability to simulate facial muscle movements and recover dynamic textures in pore-squeezing. The industry often adopts the method involving multi-view stereo and non-rigid alignment. However, this approach is prone to errors and heavily reliant on time-consuming manual processing by artists. To simplify this process, we propose Topo4D, a novel framework for automatic geometry and texture generation, which optimizes densely aligned 4D heads and 8K texture maps directly from calibrated multi-view time-series images. Specifically, we first represent the time-series faces as a set of dynamic 3D Gaussians with fixed topology in which the Gaussian centers are bound to the mesh vertices. Afterward, we perform alternative geometry and texture optimization frame-by-frame for high-quality geometry and texture learning while maintaining temporal topology stability. Finally, we can extract dynamic facial meshes in regular wiring arrangement and high-fidelity textures with pore-level details from the learned Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results than the current SOTA face reconstruction methods both in the quality of meshes and textures.

Among these, SegRNN, a robust RNN-driven model, has gained considerable attention in LTSF analysis for achieving state-of-the-art results while maintaining a remarkably streamlined architecture. Concurrently, the Mamba structure has demonstrated its advantages in small to medium-sized models due to its capability for information selection. This study introduces a variant of SegRNN that preprocesses information using a fine-tuned single-layer Mamba structure. Additionally, it incorporates implicit segmentation and residual structures into the model's encoding section to further reduce the inherent data iterative cycles of RNN architectures and implicitly integrate inter-channel correlations. This variant, named MSegRNN, utilizes the Mamba structure to select useful information, resulting in a transformed sequence. The linear-strategy-adapted derivative retains the superior memory efficiency of the original SegRNN while demonstrating enhanced performance. Empirical evaluations on real-world LTSF datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, thereby contributing to the advancement of LTSF methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[On-Device Training of Fully Quantized Deep Neural Networks on Cortex-M Microcontrollers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10734v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-device training of DNNs allows models to adapt and fine-tune to newly collected data or changing domains while deployed on microcontroller units (MCUs). However, DNN training is a resource-intensive task, making the implementation and execution of DNN training algorithms on MCUs challenging due to low processor speeds, constrained throughput, limited floating-point support, and memory constraints. In this work, we explore on-device training of DNNs for Cortex-M MCUs. We present a method that enables efficient training of DNNs completely in place on the MCU using fully quantized training (FQT) and dynamic partial gradient updates. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on multiple vision and time-series datasets and provide insights into the tradeoff between training accuracy, memory overhead, energy, and latency on real hardware.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[TimeAutoDiff: Combining Autoencoder and Diffusion model for time series tabular data synthesizing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16028v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we leverage the power of latent diffusion models to generate synthetic time series tabular data. Along with the temporal and feature correlations, the heterogeneous nature of the feature in the table has been one of the main obstacles in time series tabular data modeling. We tackle this problem by combining the ideas of the variational auto-encoder (VAE) and the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Our model named as \texttt{TimeAutoDiff} has several key advantages including (1) Generality: the ability to handle the broad spectrum of time series tabular data from single to multi-sequence datasets; (2) Good fidelity and utility guarantees: numerical experiments on six publicly available datasets demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in generating time series tabular data, across four metrics measuring fidelity and utility; (3) Fast sampling speed: entire time series data generation as opposed to the sequential data sampling schemes implemented in the existing diffusion-based models, eventually leading to significant improvements in sampling speed, (4) Entity conditional generation: the first implementation of conditional generation of multi-sequence time series tabular data with heterogenous features in the literature, enabling scenario exploration across multiple scientific and engineering domains. Codes are in preparation for release to the public, but available upon request.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Dimensional Frequency Learner for General Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10419v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frequency domain representation of time series feature offers a concise representation for handling real-world time series data with inherent complexity and dynamic nature. However, current frequency-based methods with complex operations still fall short of state-of-the-art time domain methods for general time series analysis. In this work, we present Omni-Dimensional Frequency Learner (ODFL) model based on a in depth analysis among all the three aspects of the spectrum feature: channel redundancy property among the frequency dimension, the sparse and un-salient frequency energy distribution among the frequency dimension, and the semantic diversity among the variable dimension. Technically, our method is composed of a semantic-adaptive global filter with attention to the un-salient frequency bands and partial operation among the channel dimension. Empirical results show that ODFL achieves consistent state-of-the-art in five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection, offering a promising foundation for time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[xLSTMTime : Long-term Time Series Forecasting With xLSTM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10240v1)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, transformer-based models have gained prominence in multivariate long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), demonstrating significant advancements despite facing challenges such as high computational demands, difficulty in capturing temporal dynamics, and managing long-term dependencies. The emergence of LTSF-Linear, with its straightforward linear architecture, has notably outperformed transformer-based counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of the transformer's utility in time series forecasting. In response, this paper presents an adaptation of a recent architecture termed extended LSTM (xLSTM) for LTSF. xLSTM incorporates exponential gating and a revised memory structure with higher capacity that has good potential for LTSF. Our adopted architecture for LTSF termed as xLSTMTime surpasses current approaches. We compare xLSTMTime's performance against various state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world da-tasets, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities. Our findings suggest that refined recurrent architectures can offer competitive alternatives to transformer-based models in LTSF tasks, po-tentially redefining the landscape of time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[TwinS: Revisiting Non-Stationarity in Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03710v2)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multivariate time series forecasting tasks have garnered increasing attention due to their significant practical applications, leading to the emergence of various deep forecasting models. However, real-world time series exhibit pronounced non-stationary distribution characteristics. These characteristics are not solely limited to time-varying statistical properties highlighted by non-stationary Transformer but also encompass three key aspects: nested periodicity, absence of periodic distributions, and hysteresis among time variables. In this paper, we begin by validating this theory through wavelet analysis and propose the Transformer-based TwinS model, which consists of three modules to address the non-stationary periodic distributions: Wavelet Convolution, Period-Aware Attention, and Channel-Temporal Mixed MLP. Specifically, The Wavelet Convolution models nested periods by scaling the convolution kernel size like wavelet transform. The Period-Aware Attention guides attention computation by generating period relevance scores through a convolutional sub-network. The Channel-Temporal Mixed MLP captures the overall relationships between time series through channel-time mixing learning. TwinS achieves SOTA performance compared to mainstream TS models, with a maximum improvement in MSE of 25.8\% over PatchTST.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attractor Memory for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting: A Chaos Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11463v6)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks, an increasing number of models have acknowledged that discrete time series originate from continuous dynamic systems and have attempted to model their dynamical structures. Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, \textbf{\textit{Attraos}}, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding and the proposed multi-scale dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamics structure and predicts by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-SSM: Simplifying and Unifying State Space Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16312v2)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a potent tool in sequence modeling tasks in recent years. These models approximate continuous systems using a set of basis functions and discretize them to handle input data, making them well-suited for modeling time series data collected at specific frequencies from continuous systems. Despite its potential, the application of SSMs in time series forecasting remains underexplored, with most existing models treating SSMs as a black box for capturing temporal or channel dependencies. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel theoretical framework termed Dynamic Spectral Operator, offering more intuitive and general guidance on applying SSMs to time series data. Building upon our theory, we introduce Time-SSM, a novel SSM-based foundation model with only one-seventh of the parameters compared to Mamba. Various experiments validate both our theoretical framework and the superior performance of Time-SSM.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.11463</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing Feature Clustering For Enhanced Anomaly Detection With Variational Autoencoder And Dynamic Threshold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10042v1)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an anomaly detection method for multivariate time series data with the aim of identifying critical periods and features influencing extreme climate events like snowmelt in the Arctic. This method leverages the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) integrated with dynamic thresholding and correlation-based feature clustering. This framework enhances the VAE's ability to identify localized dependencies and learn the temporal relationships in climate data, thereby improving the detection of anomalies as demonstrated by its higher F1-score on benchmark datasets. The study's main contributions include the development of a robust anomaly detection method, improving feature representation within VAEs through clustering, and creating a dynamic threshold algorithm for localized anomaly detection. This method offers explainability of climate anomalies across different regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was presented at the 2024 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, IGARSS 2024, 07-12 July 2024, Athens, Greece</p></details> |
| **[Convolutional and Deep Learning based techniques for Time Series Ordinal Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10084v2)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Classification (TSC) covers the supervised learning problem where input data is provided in the form of series of values observed through repeated measurements over time, and whose objective is to predict the category to which they belong. When the class values are ordinal, classifiers that take this into account can perform better than nominal classifiers. Time Series Ordinal Classification (TSOC) is the field covering this gap, yet unexplored in the literature. There are a wide range of time series problems showing an ordered label structure, and TSC techniques that ignore the order relationship discard useful information. Hence, this paper presents a first benchmarking of TSOC methodologies, exploiting the ordering of the target labels to boost the performance of current TSC state-of-the-art. Both convolutional- and deep learning-based methodologies (among the best performing alternatives for nominal TSC) are adapted for TSOC. For the experiments, a selection of 29 ordinal problems from two well-known archives has been made. In this way, this paper contributes to the establishment of the state-of-the-art in TSOC. The results obtained by ordinal versions are found to be significantly better than current nominal TSC techniques in terms of ordinal performance metrics, outlining the importance of considering the ordering of the labels when dealing with this kind of problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Granger Causality in Extremes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09632v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a rigorous mathematical framework for Granger causality in extremes, designed to identify causal links from extreme events in time series. Granger causality plays a pivotal role in uncovering directional relationships among time-varying variables. While this notion gains heightened importance during extreme and highly volatile periods, state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on causality within the body of the distribution, often overlooking causal mechanisms that manifest only during extreme events. Our framework is designed to infer causality mainly from extreme events by leveraging the causal tail coefficient. We establish equivalences between causality in extremes and other causal concepts, including (classical) Granger causality, Sims causality, and structural causality. We prove other key properties of Granger causality in extremes and show that the framework is especially helpful under the presence of hidden confounders. We also propose a novel inference method for detecting the presence of Granger causality in extremes from data. Our method is model-free, can handle non-linear and high-dimensional time series, outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in all considered setups, both in performance and speed, and was found to uncover coherent effects when applied to financial and extreme weather observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniSat: Self-Supervised Modality Fusion for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08351v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Earth Observations (EO) offers a wealth of data from diverse sensors, presenting a great opportunity for advancing self-supervised multimodal learning. However, current multimodal EO datasets and models focus on a single data type, either mono-date images or time series, which limits their expressivity. We introduce OmniSat, a novel architecture that exploits the spatial alignment between multiple EO modalities to learn expressive multimodal representations without labels. To demonstrate the advantages of combining modalities of different natures, we augment two existing datasets with new modalities. As demonstrated on three downstream tasks: forestry, land cover classification, and crop mapping. OmniSat can learn rich representations in an unsupervised manner, leading to improved performance in the semi- and fully-supervised settings, even when only one modality is available for inference. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/gastruc/OmniSat.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning High-Frequency Functions Made Easy with Sinusoidal Positional Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09370v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fourier features based positional encoding (PE) is commonly used in machine learning tasks that involve learning high-frequency features from low-dimensional inputs, such as 3D view synthesis and time series regression with neural tangent kernels. Despite their effectiveness, existing PEs require manual, empirical adjustment of crucial hyperparameters, specifically the Fourier features, tailored to each unique task. Further, PEs face challenges in efficiently learning high-frequency functions, particularly in tasks with limited data. In this paper, we introduce sinusoidal PE (SPE), designed to efficiently learn adaptive frequency features closely aligned with the true underlying function. Our experiments demonstrate that SPE, without hyperparameter tuning, consistently achieves enhanced fidelity and faster training across various tasks, including 3D view synthesis, Text-to-Speech generation, and 1D regression. SPE is implemented as a direct replacement for existing PEs. Its plug-and-play nature lets numerous tasks easily adopt and benefit from SPE.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, Conference, Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Guidelines for Augmentation Selection in Contrastive Learning for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09336v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised contrastive learning has become a key technique in deep learning, particularly in time series analysis, due to its ability to learn meaningful representations without explicit supervision. Augmentation is a critical component in contrastive learning, where different augmentations can dramatically impact performance, sometimes influencing accuracy by over 30%. However, the selection of augmentations is predominantly empirical which can be suboptimal, or grid searching that is time-consuming. In this paper, we establish a principled framework for selecting augmentations based on dataset characteristics such as trend and seasonality. Specifically, we construct 12 synthetic datasets incorporating trend, seasonality, and integration weights. We then evaluate the effectiveness of 8 different augmentations across these synthetic datasets, thereby inducing generalizable associations between time series characteristics and augmentation efficiency. Additionally, we evaluated the induced associations across 6 real-world datasets encompassing domains such as activity recognition, disease diagnosis, traffic monitoring, electricity usage, mechanical fault prognosis, and finance. These real-world datasets are diverse, covering a range from 1 to 12 channels, 2 to 10 classes, sequence lengths of 14 to 1280, and data frequencies from 250 Hz to daily intervals. The experimental results show that our proposed trend-seasonality-based augmentation recommendation algorithm can accurately identify the effective augmentations for a given time series dataset, achieving an average Recall@3 of 0.667, outperforming baselines. Our work provides guidance for studies employing contrastive learning in time series analysis, with wide-ranging applications. All the code, datasets, and analysis results will be released at https://github.com/DL4mHealth/TS-Contrastive-Augmentation-Recommendation.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Early Classification of Time Series: Taxonomy and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18332v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many situations, the measurements of a studied phenomenon are provided sequentially, and the prediction of its class needs to be made as early as possible so as not to incur too high a time penalty, but not too early and risk paying the cost of misclassification. This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see \url{https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm}).</p></details> |  |
| **[Pixel-wise Agricultural Image Time Series Classification: Comparisons and a Deformable Prototype-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12533v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improvements in Earth observation by satellites allow for imagery of ever higher temporal and spatial resolution. Leveraging this data for agricultural monitoring is key for addressing environmental and economic challenges. Current methods for crop segmentation using temporal data either rely on annotated data or are heavily engineered to compensate the lack of supervision. In this paper, we present and compare datasets and methods for both supervised and unsupervised pixel-wise segmentation of satellite image time series (SITS). We also introduce an approach to add invariance to spectral deformations and temporal shifts to classical prototype-based methods such as K-means and Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC). We study different levels of supervision and show this simple and highly interpretable method achieves the best performance in the low data regime and significantly improves the state of the art for unsupervised classification of agricultural time series on four recent SITS datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version.

| **[Accelerating Time Series Analysis via Processing using Non-Volatile Memories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04369v3)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Analysis (TSA) is a critical workload to extract valuable information from collections of sequential data, e.g., detecting anomalies in electrocardiograms. Subsequence Dynamic Time Warping (sDTW) is the state-of-the-art algorithm for high-accuracy TSA. We find that the performance and energy efficiency of sDTW on conventional CPU and GPU platforms are heavily burdened by the latency and energy overheads of data movement between the compute and the memory units. sDTW exhibits low arithmetic intensity and low data reuse on conventional platforms, stemming from poor amortization of the data movement overheads. To improve the performance and energy efficiency of the sDTW algorithm, we propose MATSA, the first Magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM)-based Accelerator for TSA. MATSA leverages Processing-Using-Memory (PUM) based on MRAM crossbars to minimize data movement overheads and exploit parallelism in sDTW. MATSA improves performance by 7.35x/6.15x/6.31x and energy efficiency by 11.29x/4.21x/2.65x over server-class CPU, GPU, and Processing-Near-Memory platforms, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access, 2024, volume 12</p></details> |
| **[ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794v3)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of disease progression from images is a holy grail for clinical decision making. However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some typos.

| **[Parameter inference from a non-stationary unknown process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08987v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-stationary systems are found throughout the world, from climate patterns under the influence of variation in carbon dioxide concentration, to brain dynamics driven by ascending neuromodulation. Accordingly, there is a need for methods to analyze non-stationary processes, and yet most time-series analysis methods that are used in practice, on important problems across science and industry, make the simplifying assumption of stationarity. One important problem in the analysis of non-stationary systems is the problem class that we refer to as Parameter Inference from a Non-stationary Unknown Process (PINUP). Given an observed time series, this involves inferring the parameters that drive non-stationarity of the time series, without requiring knowledge or inference of a mathematical model of the underlying system. Here we review and unify a diverse literature of algorithms for PINUP. We formulate the problem, and categorize the various algorithmic contributions. This synthesis will allow researchers to identify gaps in the literature and will enable systematic comparisons of different methods. We also demonstrate that the most common systems that existing methods are tested on - notably the non-stationary Lorenz process and logistic map - are surprisingly easy to perform well on using simple statistical features like windowed mean and variance, undermining the practice of using good performance on these systems as evidence of algorithmic performance. We then identify more challenging problems that many existing methods perform poorly on and which can be used to drive methodological advances in the field. Our results unify disjoint scientific contributions to analyzing non-stationary systems and suggest new directions for progress on the PINUP problem and the broader study of non-stationary phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loss Shaping Constraints for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09373v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several applications in time series forecasting require predicting multiple steps ahead. Despite the vast amount of literature in the topic, both classical and recent deep learning based approaches have mostly focused on minimising performance averaged over the predicted window. We observe that this can lead to disparate distributions of errors across forecasting steps, especially for recent transformer architectures trained on popular forecasting benchmarks. That is, optimising performance on average can lead to undesirably large errors at specific time-steps. In this work, we present a Constrained Learning approach for long-term time series forecasting that aims to find the best model in terms of average performance that respects a user-defined upper bound on the loss at each time-step. We call our approach loss shaping constraints because it imposes constraints on the loss at each time step, and leverage recent duality results to show that despite its non-convexity, the resulting problem has a bounded duality gap. We propose a practical Primal-Dual algorithm to tackle it, and demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits competitive average performance in time series forecasting benchmarks, while shaping the distribution of errors across the predicted window.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sensor-Aware Classifiers for Energy-Efficient Time Series Applications on IoT Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08715v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data processing is an important component of many real-world applications, such as health monitoring, environmental monitoring, and digital agriculture. These applications collect distinct windows of sensor data (e.g., few seconds) and process them to assess the environment. Machine learning (ML) models are being employed in time-series applications due to their generalization abilities for classification. State-of-the-art time-series applications wait for entire sensor data window to become available before processing the data using ML algorithms, resulting in high sensor energy consumption. However, not all situations require processing full sensor window to make accurate inference. For instance, in activity recognition, sitting and standing activities can be inferred with partial windows. Using this insight, we propose to employ early exit classifiers with partial sensor windows to minimize energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. Specifically, we first utilize multiple early exits with successively increasing amount of data as they become available in a window. If early exits provide inference with high confidence, we return the label and enter low power mode for sensors. The proposed approach has potential to enable significant energy savings in time series applications. We utilize neural networks and random forest classifiers to evaluate our approach. Our evaluations with six datasets show that the proposed approach enables up to 50-60% energy savings on average without any impact on accuracy. The energy savings can enable time-series applications in remote locations with limited energy availability.</p></details> |  |

FAR solutions analyse and learn from multiple data sources, including time series pricing data, customer profile information and expectations, as well as past investments. However, most models have been developed over proprietary datasets, making a comparison over a common benchmark impossible. In this paper, we aim to solve this problem by introducing FAR-Trans, the first public dataset for FAR, containing pricing information and retail investor transactions acquired from a large European financial institution. We also provide a bench-marking comparison between eleven FAR algorithms over the data for use as future baselines.

However, tackling time-series analysis tasks usually involves designing and training a separate model from scratch leveraging training data and domain expertise specific to the task. We tackle a significant challenge for pre-training a foundational time-series model from multi-domain time-series datasets: extracting semantically useful tokenized inputs to the model across heterogenous time-series from different domains. We propose Large Pre-trained Time-series Models (LPTM) that introduces a novel method of \textit{adaptive segmentation} that automatically identifies optimal dataset-specific segmentation strategy during pre-training. This enables LPTM to perform similar to or better than domain-specific state-of-art model when fine-tuned to different downstream time-series analysis tasks and under zero-shot settings. LPTM achieves superior forecasting and time-series classification results taking up to 40% less data and 50% less training time compared to state-of-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Toto: Time Series Optimized Transformer for Observability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07874v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This technical report describes the Time Series Optimized Transformer for Observability (Toto), a new state of the art foundation model for time series forecasting developed by Datadog. In addition to advancing the state of the art on generalized time series benchmarks in domains such as electricity and weather, this model is the first general-purpose time series forecasting foundation model to be specifically tuned for observability metrics. Toto was trained on a dataset of one trillion time series data points, the largest among all currently published time series foundation models. Alongside publicly available time series datasets, 75% of the data used to train Toto consists of fully anonymous numerical metric data points from the Datadog platform.

| **[Paving the way toward foundation models for irregular and unaligned Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08448v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recently several foundation models for satellite remote sensing imagery have been proposed, they fail to address major challenges of real/operational applications. Indeed, embeddings that don't take into account the spectral, spatial and temporal dimensions of the data as well as the irregular or unaligned temporal sampling are of little use for most real world uses.As a consequence, we propose an ALIgned Sits Encoder (ALISE), a novel approach that leverages the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions of irregular and unaligned SITS while producing aligned latent representations. Unlike SSL models currently available for SITS, ALISE incorporates a flexible query mechanism to project the SITS into a common and learned temporal projection space. Additionally, thanks to a multi-view framework, we explore integration of instance discrimination along a masked autoencoding task to SITS. The quality of the produced representation is assessed through three downstream tasks: crop segmentation (PASTIS), land cover segmentation (MultiSenGE), and a novel crop change detection dataset. Furthermore, the change detection task is performed without supervision. The results suggest that the use of aligned representations is more effective than previous SSL methods for linear probing segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |

A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel classification framework for time-series imputation using deep learning, with a particular focus on clinical data. By identifying conceptual gaps in the literature and existing reviews, we devise a taxonomy grounded on the inductive bias of neural imputation frameworks, resulting in a classification of existing deep imputation strategies based on their suitability for specific imputation scenarios and data-specific properties. Our review further examines the existing methodologies employed to benchmark deep imputation models, evaluating their effectiveness in capturing the missingness scenarios found in clinical data and emphasising the importance of reconciling mathematical abstraction with clinical insights. Our classification aims to serve as a guide for researchers to facilitate the selection of appropriate deep learning imputation techniques tailored to their specific clinical data. Our novel perspective also highlights the significance of bridging the gap between computational methodologies and medical insights to achieve clinically sound imputation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[DACAD: Domain Adaptation Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11269v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series anomaly detection (TSAD), the scarcity of labeled data poses a challenge to the development of accurate models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Centre-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection using Masked Latent Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12550v4)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel time series anomaly detection method that achieves excellent detection accuracy while offering a superior level of explainability. Our proposed method, TimeVQVAE-AD, leverages masked generative modeling adapted from the cutting-edge time series generation method known as TimeVQVAE. The prior model is trained on the discrete latent space of a time-frequency domain. Notably, the dimensional semantics of the time-frequency domain are preserved in the latent space, enabling us to compute anomaly scores across different frequency bands, which provides a better insight into the detected anomalies. Additionally, the generative nature of the prior model allows for sampling likely normal states for detected anomalies, enhancing the explainability of the detected anomalies through counterfactuals. Our experimental evaluation on the UCR Time Series Anomaly archive demonstrates that TimeVQVAE-AD significantly surpasses the existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and explainability. We provide our implementation on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/ML4ITS/TimeVQVAE-AnomalyDetection}.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptively Weighted Averaging Method for Regional Time Series Extraction of fMRI-based Brain Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08174v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain decoding that classifies cognitive states using the functional fluctuations of the brain can provide insightful information for understanding the brain mechanisms of cognitive functions. Among the common procedures of decoding the brain cognitive states with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), extracting the time series of each brain region after brain parcellation traditionally averages across the voxels within a brain region. This neglects the spatial information among the voxels and the requirement of extracting information for the downstream tasks. In this study, we propose to use a fully connected neural network that is jointly trained with the brain decoder to perform an adaptively weighted average across the voxels within each brain region. We perform extensive evaluations by cognitive state decoding, manifold learning, and interpretability analysis on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. The performance comparison of the cognitive state decoding presents an accuracy increase of up to 5\% and stable accuracy improvement under different time window sizes, resampling sizes, and training data sizes. The results of manifold learning show that our method presents a considerable separability among cognitive states and basically excludes subject-specific information. The interpretability analysis shows that our method can identify reasonable brain regions corresponding to each cognitive state. Our study would aid the improvement of the basic pipeline of fMRI processing.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

The ERG is a promising way to study different neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts language, communication, and reciprocal social interactions. However, in heterogeneous populations, such as ASD, where the ability to collect large datasets is limited, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is complicated. Synthetic ERG signals generated from real ERG recordings carry similar information as natural ERGs and, therefore, could be used as an extension for natural data to increase datasets so that AI applications can be fully utilized. As proof of principle, this study presents a Generative Adversarial Network capable of generating synthetic ERG signals of children with ASD and typically developing control individuals. We applied a Time Series Transformer and Visual Transformer with Continuous Wavelet Transform to enhance classification results on the extended synthetic signals dataset. This approach may support classification models in related psychiatric conditions where the ERG may help classify disorders.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, in other areas of robotics, large models and sim-to-real have led to tremendous progress. Inspired by such work, we present AutoMate, a learning framework and system that consists of 4 parts: 1) a dataset of 100 assemblies compatible with simulation and the real world, along with parallelized simulation environments for policy learning, 2) a novel simulation-based approach for learning specialist (i.e., part-specific) policies and generalist (i.e., unified) assembly policies, 3) demonstrations of specialist policies that individually solve 80 assemblies with 80% or higher success rates in simulation, as well as a generalist policy that jointly solves 20 assemblies with an 80%+ success rate, and 4) zero-shot sim-to-real transfer that achieves similar (or better) performance than simulation, including on perception-initialized assembly. The key methodological takeaway is that a union of diverse algorithms from manufacturing engineering, character animation, and time-series analysis provides a generic and robust solution for a diverse range of robotic assembly problems.To our knowledge, AutoMate provides the first simulation-based framework for learning specialist and generalist policies over a wide range of assemblies, as well as the first system demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer over such a range.</p></details> |  |

Differing from the traditional six-layer IT2FNN, a nine-layer network is developed to improve prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and model interpretability. First, a new co-antecedent layer and a modified consequent layer are devised to improve the interpretability of the fuzzy model for multi-step predictions. Second, a new transformation layer is designed to address the potential issues in the vanished rule firing strength caused by highdimensional inputs. Third, a new link layer is proposed to build temporal connections between multi-step predictions. Furthermore, a two-stage self-organizing mechanism is developed to automatically generate the fuzzy rules, in which the first stage is used to create the rule base from empty and perform the initial optimization, while the second stage is to fine-tune all network parameters. Finally, various simulations are carried out on chaotic and microgrid time series prediction problems, demonstrating the superiority of our approach in terms of prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and model interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Weak Label Generation for Data Programming with Clinicians in the Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07982v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often data hungry and need high-quality labeled data in copious amounts for learning to converge. This is a challenge in the field of medicine since high quality labeled data is often scarce. Data programming has been the ray of hope in this regard, since it allows us to label unlabeled data using multiple weak labeling functions. Such functions are often supplied by a domain expert. Data-programming can combine multiple weak labeling functions and suggest labels better than simple majority voting over the different functions. However, it is not straightforward to express such weak labeling functions, especially in high-dimensional settings such as images and time-series data. What we propose in this paper is a way to bypass this issue, using distance functions. In high-dimensional spaces, it is easier to find meaningful distance metrics which can generalize across different labeling tasks. We propose an algorithm that queries an expert for labels of a few representative samples of the dataset. These samples are carefully chosen by the algorithm to capture the distribution of the dataset. The labels assigned by the expert on the representative subset induce a labeling on the full dataset, thereby generating weak labels to be used in the data programming pipeline. In our medical time series case study, labeling a subset of 50 to 130 out of 3,265 samples showed 17-28% improvement in accuracy and 13-28% improvement in F1 over the baseline using clinician-defined labeling functions. In our medical image case study, labeling a subset of about 50 to 120 images from 6,293 unlabeled medical images using our approach showed significant improvement over the baseline method, Snuba, with an increase of approximately 5-15% in accuracy and 12-19% in F1 score.</p></details> |  |

However, it has been limited to small-scale datasets, e.g., thousands of temporal sequences. In this work, we make key technical contributions that are tailored to the numerical properties of time-series data and allow the model to scale to large datasets, e.g., millions of temporal sequences. We adopt the Transformer architecture by first partitioning the input into non-overlapping windows. Each window is then characterized by its normalized shape and two scalar values denoting the mean and standard deviation within each window. To embed scalar values that may possess arbitrary numerical amplitudes in a high-dimensional space, we propose a numerically multi-scaled embedding module enumerating all possible numerical scales for the scalars. The model undergoes pretraining with a simple contrastive objective on a large-scale dataset over a million sequences collected by merging existing public data. We study its transfer performance on a number of univariate and multivariate classification tasks, few shot learning, unsupervised clustering and anomaly detection benchmarks. Our method exhibits remarkable improvement against previous pretraining approaches and establishes the new state of the art, even compared with domain-specific non-learning-based methods.

| **[Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07655v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph signal processing (GSP) facilitates the analysis of high-dimensional data on non-Euclidean domains by utilizing graph signals defined on graph vertices. In addition to static data, each vertex can provide continuous time-series signals, transforming graph signals into time-series signals on each vertex. The joint time-vertex Fourier transform (JFT) framework offers spectral analysis capabilities to analyze these joint time-vertex signals. Analogous to the fractional Fourier transform (FRT) extending the ordinary Fourier transform (FT), we introduce the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRT) as a generalization of JFT. The JFRT enables fractional analysis for joint time-vertex processing by extending Fourier analysis to fractional orders in both temporal and vertex domains. We theoretically demonstrate that JFRT generalizes JFT and maintains properties such as index additivity, reversibility, reduction to identity, and unitarity for specific graph topologies. Additionally, we derive Tikhonov regularization-based denoising in the JFRT domain, ensuring robust and well-behaved solutions. Comprehensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the effectiveness of JFRT in denoising and clustering tasks that outperform state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Satellite Image Time Series Semantic Change Detection: Novel Architecture and Analysis of Domain Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07616v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in monitoring changes happening on Earth's surface and aiding in climate analysis, ecosystem assessment, and disaster response. In this paper, we tackle semantic change detection with satellite image time series (SITS-SCD) which encompasses both change detection and semantic segmentation tasks. We propose a new architecture that improves over the state of the art, scales better with the number of parameters, and leverages long-term temporal information. However, for practical use cases, models need to adapt to spatial and temporal shifts, which remains a challenge. We investigate the impact of temporal and spatial shifts separately on global, multi-year SITS datasets using DynamicEarthNet and MUDS. We show that the spatial domain shift represents the most complex setting and that the impact of temporal shift on performance is more pronounced on change detection than on semantic segmentation, highlighting that it is a specific issue deserving further attention.</p></details> |  |

However, neural representations of distributional regression models, such as the Cox model, have received little attention so far. We close this gap by proposing a framework for distributional regression using inverse flow transformations (DRIFT), which includes neural representations of the aforementioned models. We empirically demonstrate that the neural representations of models in DRIFT can serve as a substitute for their classical statistical counterparts in several applications involving continuous, ordered, time-series, and survival outcomes. We confirm that models in DRIFT empirically match the performance of several statistical methods in terms of estimation of partial effects, prediction, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. DRIFT covers both interpretable statistical models and flexible neural networks opening up new avenues in both statistical modeling and deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at UAI 2024 https://www.auai.org/uai2024/accepted_papers</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven Bayesian State Estimation with Compressed Measurement of Model-free Process using Semi-supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The research topic is: data-driven Bayesian state estimation with compressed measurement (BSCM) of model-free process, say for a (causal) tracking application. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than the dimension of the temporal state vector to be estimated. Hence the state estimation problem is an underdetermined inverse problem. The state-space-model (SSM) of the underlying dynamical process is assumed to be unknown and hence, we use the terminology 'model-free process'. In absence of the SSM, we can not employ traditional model-driven methods like Kalman Filter (KF) and Particle Filter (PF) and instead require data-driven methods. We first experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem for model-free process; they are data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) method and deep Markov model (DMM) method. The unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data comprised of only noisy measurements. While DANSE provides a good predictive performance to model the temporal measurement data as time-series, its unsupervised learning lacks a regularization for state estimation. We then investigate use of a semi-supervised learning approach, and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In the semi-supervised learning, we use a limited amount of labelled data along-with a large amount of unlabelled data, and that helps to bring the desired regularization for BSCM problem in the absence of SSM. The labelled data means pairwise measurement-and-state data. Using three chaotic dynamical systems (or processes) with nonlinear SSMs as benchmark, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive performance for BSCM against three SSM-informed methods - a hybrid method called KalmanNet, and two traditional model-driven methods called extended KF and unscented KF.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, under review at IEEE TSP.

| **[ViTime: A Visual Intelligence-Based Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07311v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) has opened new avenues for constructing foundation models for time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field.

| **[Causal Discovery in Semi-Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07291v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering causal relations from observational time series without making the stationary assumption is a significant challenge. In practice, this challenge is common in many areas, such as retail sales, transportation systems, and medical science. Here, we consider this problem for a class of non-stationary time series. The structural causal model (SCM) of this type of time series, called the semi-stationary time series, exhibits that a finite number of different causal mechanisms occur sequentially and periodically across time. This model holds considerable practical utility because it can represent periodicity, including common occurrences such as seasonality and diurnal variation. We propose a constraint-based, non-parametric algorithm for discovering causal relations in this setting. The resulting algorithm, PCMCI$_{\Omega}$, can capture the alternating and recurring changes in the causal mechanisms and then identify the underlying causal graph with conditional independence (CI) tests. We show that this algorithm is sound in identifying causal relations on discrete time series. We validate the algorithm with extensive experiments on continuous and discrete simulated data. We also apply our algorithm to a real-world climate dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Discovery-Driven Change Point Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07290v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change point detection in time series seeks to identify times when the probability distribution of time series changes. It is widely applied in many areas, such as human-activity sensing and medical science. In the context of multivariate time series, this typically involves examining the joint distribution of high-dimensional data: If any one variable changes, the whole time series is assumed to have changed. However, in practical applications, we may be interested only in certain components of the time series, exploring abrupt changes in their distributions in the presence of other time series. Here, assuming an underlying structural causal model that governs the time-series data generation, we address this problem by proposing a two-stage non-parametric algorithm that first learns parts of the causal structure through constraint-based discovery methods. The algorithm then uses conditional relative Pearson divergence estimation to identify the change points. The conditional relative Pearson divergence quantifies the distribution disparity between consecutive segments in the time series, while the causal discovery method enables a focus on the causal mechanism, facilitating access to independent and identically distributed (IID) samples. Theoretically, the typical assumption of samples being IID in conventional change point detection methods can be relaxed based on the Causal Markov Condition. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the correctness and utility of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity and volume of this data present substantial challenges in data modeling and analysis, which have been tamed with approaches spanning time series modeling to deep learning techniques. The latest frontier in this domain is the adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, for data analysis, modeling, understanding, and generation of human behavior through the lens of wearable sensor data. This survey explores current trends and challenges in applying LLMs for sensor-based human activity recognition and behavior modeling.

Furthermore, we propose metrics to evaluate the detection delay and root-cause capability of our approach and present results from experiments on a real-world industrial data set. When properly configured, TeVAE flags anomalies only 6% of the time wrongly and detects 65% of anomalies present. It also has the potential to perform well with a smaller training and validation subset but requires a more sophisticated threshold estimation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Studies in Computational Intelligence Journal. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.02253</p></details> |

Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach. In this paper, we focus on the reservoir computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Time series data, however, are often scarce or highly sensitive, which precludes the sharing of data between researchers and industrial organizations and the application of existing and new data-intensive ML methods. A possible solution to this bottleneck is to generate synthetic data. In this work, we introduce Time Series Generative Modeling (TSGM), an open-source framework for the generative modeling of synthetic time series. TSGM includes a broad repertoire of machine learning methods: generative models, probabilistic, and simulator-based approaches. The framework enables users to evaluate the quality of the produced data from different angles: similarity, downstream effectiveness, predictive consistency, diversity, and privacy. The framework is extensible, which allows researchers to rapidly implement their own methods and compare them in a shareable environment. TSGM was tested on open datasets and in production and proved to be beneficial in both cases. Additionally to the library, the project allows users to employ command line interfaces for synthetic data generation which lowers the entry threshold for those without a programming background.</p></details> |  |

In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a language embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on well-established time series classification benchmark datasets. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging language encoders to embed time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODE-based models typically require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on either the initial observed value or the most recent observation, raising questions about their effectiveness when dealing with longer sequences and extended time intervals. In this article, we explore the behaviour of the ODE models in the context of time series data with varying degrees of sparsity. We introduce SeqLink, an innovative neural architecture designed to enhance the robustness of sequence representation. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on the hidden state generated from the last observed value, SeqLink leverages ODE latent representations derived from multiple data samples, enabling it to generate robust data representations regardless of sequence length or data sparsity level. The core concept behind our model is the definition of hidden states for the unobserved values based on the relationships between samples (links between sequences). Through extensive experiments on partially observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SeqLink improves the modelling of intermittent time series, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

To that end, we introduce GeoWATCH, a flexible framework for training models on long sequences of satellite images sourced from multiple sensor platforms, which is designed to handle image classification, activity recognition, object detection, or object tracking tasks. Our system includes a novel partial weight loading mechanism based on sub-graph isomorphism which allows for continually training and modifying a network over many training cycles. This has allowed us to train a lineage of models over a long period of time, which we have observed has improved performance as we adjust configurations while maintaining a core backbone.</p></details> | <details><summary>IGARS...</summary><p>IGARSS 2024 https://2024.ieeeigarss.org/view_paper.php?PaperNum=5431</p></details> |

The dataset comprises frequent, real-time measurements from a full-scale WWTP, with a sample interval of 2 minutes, making it ideal for developing models for real-time operation and control. This comprehensive bio-chemical dataset includes detailed influent and effluent parameters, operational conditions, and environmental factors. Unlike existing datasets, it addresses the unique challenges of modeling $N_2O$, a potent greenhouse gas, providing a valuable resource for researchers to enhance predictive accuracy and control strategies in wastewater treatment processes. Additionally, this dataset significantly contributes to the fields of machine learning and deep learning time series forecasting by serving as a benchmark that mirrors the complexities of real-world processes, thus facilitating advancements in these domains. We provide a detailed description of the dataset along with a statistical analysis to highlight its characteristics, such as nonstationarity, nonnormality, seasonality, heteroscedasticity, structural breaks, asymmetric distributions, and intermittency, which are common in many real-world time series datasets and pose challenges for forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Deep Learning-based Anomaly Detection and Log Analysis for Computer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05639v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer network anomaly detection and log analysis, as an important topic in the field of network security, has been a key task to ensure network security and system reliability. First, existing network anomaly detection and log analysis methods are often challenged by high-dimensional data and complex network topologies, resulting in unstable performance and high false-positive rates. In addition, traditional methods are usually difficult to handle time-series data, which is crucial for anomaly detection and log analysis. Therefore, we need a more efficient and accurate method to cope with these problems. To compensate for the shortcomings of current methods, we propose an innovative fusion model that integrates Isolation Forest, GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), and Transformer with each other, and each of them plays a unique role. Isolation Forest is used to quickly identify anomalous data points, and GAN is used to generate synthetic data with the real data distribution characteristics to augment the training dataset, while the Transformer is used for modeling and context extraction on time series data. The synergy of these three components makes our model more accurate and robust in anomaly detection and log analysis tasks. We validate the effectiveness of this fusion model in an extensive experimental evaluation. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves the accuracy of anomaly detection while reducing the false alarm rate, which helps to detect potential network problems in advance. The model also performs well in the log analysis task and is able to quickly identify anomalous behaviors, which helps to improve the stability of the system. The significance of this study is that it introduces advanced deep learning techniques, which work anomaly detection and log analysis.</p></details> | 38 pages |

| **[Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10134v4)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction, an essential component for intelligent transportation systems, endeavours to use historical data to foresee future traffic features at specific locations. Although existing traffic prediction models often emphasize developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not improved. Recently, large language models have shown outstanding capabilities in time series analysis. Differing from existing models, LLMs progress mainly through parameter expansion and extensive pretraining while maintaining their fundamental structures. Motivated by these developments, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic prediction. In the ST-LLM, we define timesteps at each location as tokens and design a spatial-temporal embedding to learn the spatial location and global temporal patterns of these tokens. Additionally, we integrate these embeddings by a fusion convolution to each token for a unified spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, we innovate a partially frozen attention strategy to adapt the LLM to capture global spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction. Comprehensive experiments on real traffic datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM is a powerful spatial-temporal learner that outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot and zero-shot prediction scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ChenxiLiu-HNU/ST-LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MDM 2024 (Research Track)</p></details> |

We also introduce LRC units (LRCUs), as a very efficient and accurate gated RNN-model, which results from solving LRCs with an explicit Euler scheme using just one unfolding. We empirically show and formally prove that the liquid capacitance of LRCs considerably dampens the oscillations of LTCs and STCs, while at the same time dramatically increasing accuracy even for cheap solvers. We experimentally demonstrate that LRCs are a highly competitive alternative to popular neural ODEs and gated RNNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, on classic time-series benchmarks and a complex autonomous-driving lane-keeping task.</p></details> |  |

However, the semantic space of LLMs, established through the pre-training, is still underexplored and may help yield more distinctive and informative representations to facilitate time series forecasting. To this end, we propose Semantic Space Informed Prompt learning with LLM ($S^2$IP-LLM) to align the pre-trained semantic space with time series embeddings space and perform time series forecasting based on learned prompts from the joint space. We first design a tokenization module tailored for cross-modality alignment, which explicitly concatenates patches of decomposed time series components to create embeddings that effectively encode the temporal dynamics. Next, we leverage the pre-trained word token embeddings to derive semantic anchors and align selected anchors with time series embeddings by maximizing the cosine similarity in the joint space. This way, $S^2$IP-LLM can retrieve relevant semantic anchors as prompts to provide strong indicators (context) for time series that exhibit different temporal dynamics. With thorough empirical studies on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed $S^2$IP-LLM can achieve superior forecasting performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies and visualizations verify the necessity of prompt learning informed by semantic space.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAV-AD: A Robust Framework for Detection of Anomalous Data and Malicious Sensors in CAV Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05461v1)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has sparked considerable interest across diverse industries, including public transportation, underground mining, and agriculture sectors. However, CAVs' reliance on sensor readings makes them vulnerable to significant threats. Manipulating these readings can compromise CAV network security, posing serious risks for malicious activities. Although several anomaly detection (AD) approaches for CAV networks are proposed, they often fail to: i) detect multiple anomalies in specific sensor(s) with high accuracy or F1 score, and ii) identify the specific sensor being attacked. In response, this paper proposes a novel framework tailored to CAV networks, called CAV-AD, for distinguishing abnormal readings amidst multiple anomaly data while identifying malicious sensors. Specifically, CAV-AD comprises two main components: i) A novel CNN model architecture called optimized omni-scale CNN (O-OS-CNN), which optimally selects the time scale by generating all possible kernel sizes for input time series data; ii) An amplification block to increase the values of anomaly readings, enhancing sensitivity for detecting anomalies. Not only that, but CAV-AD integrates the proposed O-OS-CNN with a Kalman filter to instantly identify the malicious sensors. We extensively train CAV-AD using real-world datasets containing both instant and constant attacks, evaluating its performance in detecting intrusions from multiple anomalies, which presents a more challenging scenario. Our results demonstrate that CAV-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average accuracy of 98% and an average F1 score of 89\%, while accurately identifying the malicious sensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wastewater Treatment Plant Data for Nutrient Removal System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05346v1)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the Agtrup (BlueKolding) dataset, collected from Denmark's Agtrup wastewater treatment plant, specifically designed to enhance phosphorus removal via chemical and biological methods. This rich dataset is assembled through a high-frequency Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system data collection process, which captures a wide range of variables related to the operational dynamics of nutrient removal. It comprises time-series data featuring measurements sampled to a frequency of two minutes across various control, process, and environmental variables. The comprehensive dataset aims to foster significant advancements in wastewater management by supporting the development of sophisticated predictive models and optimizing operational strategies. By providing detailed insights into the interactions and efficiencies of chemical and biological phosphorus removal processes, the dataset serves as a vital resource for environmental researchers and engineers focused on improving the sustainability and effectiveness of wastewater treatment operations. The ultimate goal of this dataset is to facilitate the creation of digital twins and the application of machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning, to predict and enhance system performance under varying operational conditions.</p></details> | Data Paper |
| **[Topological Persistence Guided Knowledge Distillation for Wearable Sensor Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05315v1)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods have achieved a lot of success in various applications involving converting wearable sensor data to actionable health insights. A common application areas is activity recognition, where deep-learning methods still suffer from limitations such as sensitivity to signal quality, sensor characteristic variations, and variability between subjects. To mitigate these issues, robust features obtained by topological data analysis (TDA) have been suggested as a potential solution. However, there are two significant obstacles to using topological features in deep learning: (1) large computational load to extract topological features using TDA, and (2) different signal representations obtained from deep learning and TDA which makes fusion difficult. In this paper, to enable integration of the strengths of topological methods in deep-learning for time-series data, we propose to use two teacher networks, one trained on the raw time-series data, and another trained on persistence images generated by TDA methods. The distilled student model utilizes only the raw time-series data at test-time. This approach addresses both issues. The use of KD with multiple teachers utilizes complementary information, and results in a compact model with strong supervisory features and an integrated richer representation. To assimilate desirable information from different modalities, we design new constraints, including orthogonality imposed on feature correlation maps for improving feature expressiveness and allowing the student to easily learn from the teacher. Also, we apply an annealing strategy in KD for fast saturation and better accommodation from different features, while the knowledge gap between the teachers and student is reduced. Finally, a robust student model is distilled, which uses only the time-series data as an input, while implicitly preserving topological features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Engin...</summary><p>Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 130, 107719</p></details> |
| **[A Generalized Transformer-based Radio Link Failure Prediction Framework in 5G RANs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05197v1)** | 2024-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio link failure (RLF) prediction system in Radio Access Networks (RANs) is critical for ensuring seamless communication and meeting the stringent requirements of high data rates, low latency, and improved reliability in 5G networks. However, weather conditions such as precipitation, humidity, temperature, and wind impact these communication links. Usually, historical radio link Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and their surrounding weather station observations are utilized for building learning-based RLF prediction models. However, such models must be capable of learning the spatial weather context in a dynamic RAN and effectively encoding time series KPIs with the weather observation data. Existing works fail to incorporate both of these essential design aspects of the prediction models. This paper fills the gap by proposing GenTrap, a novel RLF prediction framework that introduces a graph neural network (GNN)-based learnable weather effect aggregation module and employs state-of-the-art time series transformer as the temporal feature extractor for radio link failure prediction. The proposed aggregation method of GenTrap can be integrated into any existing prediction model to achieve better performance and generalizability. We evaluate GenTrap on two real-world datasets (rural and urban) with 2.6 million KPI data points and show that GenTrap offers a significantly higher F1-score (0.93 for rural and 0.79 for urban) compared to its counterparts while possessing generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

Replacing conventional control methods with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in energy systems is an active area of research, as these systems become increasingly complex with the advent of renewable energy sources and the desire to improve their efficiency. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are vulnerable to specific perturbations of their inputs or features, called adversarial examples. These perturbations are difficult to detect when properly regularized, but have significant effects on the ANN's output. Because DRL uses ANN to map optimal actions to observations, they are similarly vulnerable to adversarial examples. This work proposes a novel attack technique for continuous control using Group Difference Logits loss with a bifurcation layer. By combining aspects of targeted and untargeted attacks, the attack significantly increases the impact compared to an untargeted attack, with drastically smaller distortions than an optimally targeted attack. We demonstrate the impacts of powerful gradient-based attacks in a realistic smart energy environment, show how the impacts change with different DRL agents and training procedures, and use statistical and time-series analysis to evaluate attacks' stealth. The results show that adversarial attacks can have significant impacts on DRL controllers, and constraining an attack's perturbations makes it difficult to detect. However, certain DRL architectures are far more robust, and robust training methods can further reduce the impact.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

Real-world time series data often include noise, outliers, and missing values, making accurate forecasting challenging. Traditional methods model point-to-point relationships, which limits their ability to capture complex temporal patterns and increases their susceptibility to noise.To address these issues, we introduce the WindowMixer model, built on an all-MLP framework. WindowMixer leverages the continuous nature of time series by examining temporal variations from a window-based perspective. It decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components, handling them individually. For trends, a fully connected (FC) layer makes predictions. For seasonal components, time windows are projected to produce window tokens, processed by Intra-Window-Mixer and Inter-Window-Mixer modules. The Intra-Window-Mixer models relationships within each window, while the Inter-Window-Mixer models relationships between windows. This approach captures intricate patterns and long-range dependencies in the data.Experiments show WindowMixer consistently outperforms existing methods in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have found some errors in the paper, involving inaccurate data, and therefore request to withdraw the manuscript</p></details> |

When coupled with custom kernels that fuse the dequantization and matmul operations, weight-only quantization can thus enable faster inference by reducing the amount of memory movement. However, developing high-performance kernels for weight-quantized LLMs presents substantial challenges, especially when the weights are compressed to non-evenly-divisible bit widths (e.g., 3 bits) with non-uniform, lookup table (LUT) quantization. This paper describes FLUTE, a flexible lookup table engine for LUT-quantized LLMs, which uses offline restructuring of the quantized weight matrix to minimize bit manipulations associated with unpacking, and vectorization and duplication of the lookup table to mitigate shared memory bandwidth constraints. At batch sizes < 32 and quantization group size of 128 (typical in LLM inference), the FLUTE kernel can be 2-4x faster than existing GEMM kernels. As an application of FLUTE, we explore a simple extension to lookup table-based NormalFloat quantization and apply it to quantize LLaMA3 to various configurations, obtaining competitive quantization performance against strong baselines while obtaining an end-to-end throughput increase of 1.5 to 2 times.</p></details> |  |

However, item calibration is time-consuming and costly, requiring a sufficient number of respondents for the response process. We explore using six different LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama 2, Llama 3, Gemini-Pro, and Cohere Command R Plus) and various combinations of them using sampling methods to produce responses with psychometric properties similar to human answers. Results show that some LLMs have comparable or higher proficiency in College Algebra than college students. No single LLM mimics human respondents due to narrow proficiency distributions, but an ensemble of LLMs can better resemble college students' ability distribution. The item parameters calibrated by LLM-Respondents have high correlations (e.g. > 0.8 for GPT-3.5) compared to their human calibrated counterparts, and closely resemble the parameters of the human subset (e.g. 0.02 Spearman correlation difference). Several augmentation strategies are evaluated for their relative performance, with resampling methods proving most effective, enhancing the Spearman correlation from 0.89 (human only) to 0.93 (augmented human).</p></details> |  |

Introducing Chain & Hash, An LLM Fingerprinting Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10887v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amid growing concerns over the ease of theft and misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs), the need for fingerprinting models has increased. Fingerprinting, in this context, means that the model owner can link a given model to their original version, thereby identifying if their model is being misused or has been completely stolen. In this paper, we first define a set five properties a successful fingerprint should satisfy; namely, the fingerprint should be Transparent, Efficient, Persistent, Robust, and Unforgeable. Next, we propose Chain & Hash, a new, simple fingerprinting approach that implements a fingerprint with a cryptographic flavor, achieving all these properties. Chain & Hash involves generating a set of questions (the fingerprints) along with a set of potential answers. These elements are hashed together using a secure hashing technique to select the value for each question, hence providing an unforgeability property-preventing adversaries from claiming false ownership. We evaluate the Chain & Hash technique on multiple models and demonstrate its robustness against benign transformations, such as fine-tuning on different datasets, and adversarial attempts to erase the fingerprint. Finally, our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of implementing Chain & Hash and its utility, where fingerprinted models achieve almost the same performance as non-fingerprinted ones across different benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLIP: Securing LLMs IP Using Weights Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10886v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently seen widespread adoption, in both academia and industry. As these models grow, they become valuable intellectual property (IP), reflecting enormous investments by their owners. Moreover, the high cost of cloud-based deployment has driven interest towards deployment to edge devices, yet this risks exposing valuable parameters to theft and unauthorized use. Current methods to protect models' IP on the edge have limitations in terms of practicality, loss in accuracy, or suitability to requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid inference algorithm, named SLIP, designed to protect edge-deployed models from theft. SLIP is the first hybrid protocol that is both practical for real-world applications and provably secure, while having zero accuracy degradation and minimal impact on latency. It involves partitioning the model between two computing resources, one secure but expensive, and another cost-effective but vulnerable. This is achieved through matrix decomposition, ensuring that the secure resource retains a maximally sensitive portion of the model's IP while performing a minimal amount of computations, and vice versa for the vulnerable resource. Importantly, the protocol includes security guarantees that prevent attackers from exploiting the partition to infer the secured information. Finally, we present experimental results that show the robustness and effectiveness of our method, positioning it as a compelling solution for protecting LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, there has been little work on generating diagrams with T2I models. A diagram is a symbolic/schematic representation that explains information using structurally rich and spatially complex visualizations (e.g., a dense combination of related objects, text labels, directional arrows/lines, etc.). Existing state-of-the-art T2I models often fail at diagram generation because they lack fine-grained object layout control when many objects are densely connected via complex relations such as arrows/lines, and also often fail to render comprehensible text labels. To address this gap, we present DiagrammerGPT, a novel two-stage text-to-diagram generation framework leveraging the layout guidance capabilities of LLMs to generate more accurate diagrams. In the first stage, we use LLMs to generate and iteratively refine 'diagram plans' (in a planner-auditor feedback loop). In the second stage, we use a diagram generator, DiagramGLIGEN, and a text label rendering module to generate diagrams (with clear text labels) following the diagram plans. To benchmark the text-to-diagram generation task, we introduce AI2D-Caption, a densely annotated diagram dataset built on top of the AI2D dataset. We show that our DiagrammerGPT framework produces more accurate diagrams, outperforming existing T2I models. We also provide comprehensive analysis, including open-domain diagram generation, multi-platform vector graphic diagram generation, human-in-the-loop editing, and multimodal planner/auditor LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2024; Project page: https://diagrammerGPT.github.io/</p></details> |

We collect 200 Connections games to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) against expert and novice human players. Our results show that even the best-performing LLM, GPT-4o, which has otherwise shown impressive reasoning abilities on a wide variety of benchmarks, can only fully solve 8% of the games. Compared to GPT-4o, novice and expert players perform better, with expert human players significantly outperforming GPT-4o. To deepen our understanding we create a taxonomy of the knowledge types required to successfully categorize words in the Connections game, revealing that LLMs struggle with associative, encyclopedic, and linguistic knowledge. Our findings establish the New York Times Connections game as a challenging benchmark for evaluating abstract reasoning capabilities in humans and AI systems.</p></details> |  |

These LLMs come with different abilities and costs in terms of computation or pricing. Since the demand for each query can vary, e.g., because of the queried domain or its complexity, defaulting to one LLM in an application is not usually the best choice, whether it is the biggest, priciest, or even the one with the best average test performance. Consequently, picking the right LLM that is both accurate and cost-effective for an application remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce MetaLLM, a framework that dynamically and intelligently routes each query to the optimal LLM (among several available LLMs) for classification tasks, achieving significantly improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness. By framing the selection problem as a multi-armed bandit, MetaLLM balances prediction accuracy and cost efficiency under uncertainty. Our experiments, conducted on popular LLM platforms such as OpenAI's GPT models, Amazon's Titan, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's LLaMa, showcase MetaLLM's efficacy in real-world scenarios, laying the groundwork for future extensions beyond classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Circuit Analyses Are Consistent Across Training and Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10827v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most currently deployed large language models (LLMs) undergo continuous training or additional finetuning. By contrast, most research into LLMs' internal mechanisms focuses on models at one snapshot in time (the end of pre-training), raising the question of whether their results generalize to real-world settings. Existing studies of mechanisms over time focus on encoder-only or toy models, which differ significantly from most deployed models. In this study, we track how model mechanisms, operationalized as circuits, emerge and evolve across 300 billion tokens of training in decoder-only LLMs, in models ranging from 70 million to 2.8 billion parameters. We find that task abilities and the functional components that support them emerge consistently at similar token counts across scale. Moreover, although such components may be implemented by different attention heads over time, the overarching algorithm that they implement remains. Surprisingly, both these algorithms and the types of components involved therein can replicate across model scale. These results suggest that circuit analyses conducted on small models at the end of pre-training can provide insights that still apply after additional pre-training and over model scale.</p></details> |  |

Current metrics fall short in their ability to provide explainable decisions, systematically check all pieces of information in the response, and are often too computationally expensive to be used in practice. We present GraphEval: a hallucination evaluation framework based on representing information in Knowledge Graph (KG) structures. Our method identifies the specific triples in the KG that are prone to hallucinations and hence provides more insight into where in the response a hallucination has occurred, if at all, than previous methods. Furthermore, using our approach in conjunction with state-of-the-art natural language inference (NLI) models leads to an improvement in balanced accuracy on various hallucination benchmarks, compared to using the raw NLI models. Lastly, we explore the use of GraphEval for hallucination correction by leveraging the structure of the KG, a method we name GraphCorrect, and demonstrate that the majority of hallucinations can indeed be rectified.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, to be published at KiL'24: Workshop on Knowledge-infused Learning co-located with 30th ACM KDD Conference, August 26, 2024, Barcelona, Spain</p></details> |

Recently, to reduce manual annotation costs, political scientists have looked to generative large language models (LLMs) to label and analyze text data. However, previous work using LLMs for classification has implicitly relied on the universal label assumption -- correct classification of documents is possible using only a class label or minimal definition and the information that the LLM inductively learns during its pre-training. In contrast, we argue that political scientists who care about valid measurement should instead make a codebook-construct label assumption -- an LLM should follow the definition and exclusion criteria of a construct/label provided in a codebook. In this work, we collect and curate three political science datasets and their original codebooks and conduct a set of experiments to understand whether LLMs comply with codebook instructions, whether rewriting codebooks improves performance, and whether instruction-tuning LLMs on codebook-document-label tuples improves performance over zero-shot classification. Using Mistral 7B Instruct as our LLM, we find re-structuring the original codebooks gives modest gains in zero-shot performance but the model still struggles to comply with the constraints of the codebooks. Optimistically, instruction-tuning Mistral on one of our datasets gives significant gains over zero-shot inference (0.76 versus 0.53 micro F1). We hope our conceptualization of the codebook-specific task, assumptions, and instruction-tuning pipeline as well our semi-structured LLM codebook format will help political scientists readily adapt to the LLM era.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at PolMeth 2024</p></details> |
| **[CLAVE: An Adaptive Framework for Evaluating Values of LLM Generated Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10725v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) poses potential risks such as generating unethical content. Assessing LLMs' values can help expose their misalignment, but relies on reference-free evaluators, e.g., fine-tuned LLMs or close-source ones like GPT-4, to identify values reflected in generated responses. Nevertheless, these evaluators face two challenges in open-ended value evaluation: they should align with changing human value definitions with minimal annotation, against their own bias (adaptability), and detect varying value expressions and scenarios robustly (generalizability). To handle these challenges, we introduce CLAVE, a novel framework which integrates two complementary LLMs, a large one to extract high-level value concepts from a few human labels, leveraging its extensive knowledge and generalizability, and a smaller one fine-tuned on such concepts to better align with human value understanding. This dual-model approach enables calibration with any value systems using <100 human-labeled samples per value type. Then we present ValEval, a comprehensive dataset comprising 13k+ (text,value,label) tuples across diverse domains, covering three major value systems. We benchmark the capabilities of 12+ popular LLM evaluators and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Our findings reveal that combining fine-tuned small models and prompt-based large ones serves as a superior balance in value evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, these systems have been carefully designed to tackle challenges such as file parsing, metadata extraction, multi-modal information understanding and long-context reading. However, no current benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in such scenarios, where a raw file and questions are provided as input, and a corresponding response is expected as output. In this paper, we introduce DocBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based document reading systems. Our benchmark involves a meticulously crafted process, including the recruitment of human annotators and the generation of synthetic questions. It includes 229 real documents and 1,102 questions, spanning across five different domains and four major types of questions. We evaluate both proprietary LLM-based systems accessible via web interfaces or APIs, and a parse-then-read pipeline employing open-source LLMs. Our evaluations reveal noticeable gaps between existing LLM-based document reading systems and human performance, underscoring the challenges of developing proficient systems. To summarize, DocBench aims to establish a standardized benchmark for evaluating LLM-based document reading systems under diverse real-world scenarios, thereby guiding future advancements in this research area.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Uncovering Latent Arguments in Social Media Messaging by Employing LLMs-in-the-Loop Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10259v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of social media has led to a surge in popularity for automated methods of analyzing public opinion. Supervised methods are adept at text categorization, yet the dynamic nature of social media discussions poses a continual challenge for these techniques due to the constant shifting of the focus. On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting themes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching patterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant portion of research into social media discourse still depends on labor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach, which are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of discovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic LLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging. To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k Facebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads with 14 themes. Additionally, we design a downstream task as stance prediction by leveraging talking points in climate debates. Furthermore, we analyze demographic targeting and the adaptation of messaging based on real-world events.</p></details> |  |

The need for many applications to support long input sequences and process them in large batches typically causes token-generation to be bottlenecked by data transfer. For this reason, we introduce SparQ Attention, a technique for increasing the inference throughput of LLMs by utilising memory bandwidth more efficiently within the attention layers, through selective fetching of the cached history. Our proposed technique can be applied directly to off-the-shelf LLMs during inference, without requiring any modification to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. We show that SparQ Attention brings up to 8x savings in attention data transfers without substantial drops in accuracy, by evaluating Llama 2 and 3, Mistral, Gemma and Pythia models on a wide range of downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Latent Themes in Social Media Messaging: A Machine-in-the-Loop Approach Integrating LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10707v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grasping the themes of social media content is key to understanding the narratives that influence public opinion and behavior. The thematic analysis goes beyond traditional topic-level analysis, which often captures only the broadest patterns, providing deeper insights into specific and actionable themes such as "public sentiment towards vaccination", "political discourse surrounding climate policies," etc. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to uncovering latent themes in social media messaging. Recognizing the limitations of the traditional topic-level analysis, which tends to capture only overarching patterns, this study emphasizes the need for a finer-grained, theme-focused exploration. Traditional theme discovery methods typically involve manual processes and a human-in-the-loop approach. While valuable, these methods face challenges in scalability, consistency, and resource intensity in terms of time and cost. To address these challenges, we propose a machine-in-the-loop approach that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics, such as climate debate and vaccine debate. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 21k Facebook ads and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that our methodology yields more accurate and interpretable results compared to the baselines. Our results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in uncovering latent themes but also illuminate how these themes are tailored for demographic targeting in social media contexts. Additionally, our work sheds light on the dynamic nature of social media, revealing the shifts in the thematic focus of messaging in response to real-world events.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 19th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM-2025)</p></details> |
| **[Cutting Through the Clutter: The Potential of LLMs for Efficient Filtration in Systematic Literature Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10652v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In academic research, systematic literature reviews are foundational and highly relevant, yet tedious to create due to the high volume of publications and labor-intensive processes involved. Systematic selection of relevant papers through conventional means like keyword-based filtering techniques can sometimes be inadequate, plagued by semantic ambiguities and inconsistent terminology, which can lead to sub-optimal outcomes. To mitigate the required extensive manual filtering, we explore and evaluate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency, speed, and precision of literature review filtering, reducing the amount of manual screening required. By using models as classification agents acting on a structured database only, we prevent common problems inherent in LLMs, such as hallucinations. We evaluate the real-world performance of such a setup during the construction of a recent literature survey paper with initially more than 8.3k potentially relevant articles under consideration and compare this with human performance on the same dataset. Our findings indicate that employing advanced LLMs like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, or Llama3 with simple prompting can significantly reduce the time required for literature filtering - from usually weeks of manual research to only a few minutes. Simultaneously, we crucially show that false negatives can indeed be controlled through a consensus scheme, achieving recalls >98.8% at or even beyond the typical human error threshold, thereby also providing for more accurate and relevant articles selected. Our research not only demonstrates a substantial improvement in the methodology of literature reviews but also sets the stage for further integration and extensive future applications of responsible AI in academic research practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Mechanism Design for LLM Fine-tuning with Multiple Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16276v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) through the aggregation of multiple preferences has attracted considerable attention. However, the existing literature predominantly focuses on the empirical performance of aggregation algorithms, while neglecting the underlying motivation for agents to misreport their preferences. In this paper, we formalize this as a multi-parameter mechanism design problem, where an LLM provider designs both training and payment rules to achieve specific objectives and promote the truthful reporting of preferences. Firstly, we claim the necessity of a payment scheme by demonstrating that without payments, truth-telling is a strictly dominated strategy under a wide range of training rules. Then, we introduce the affine maximizer payment scheme for the social welfare maximizing training rules that are widely used in practice, which ensures both dominant-strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) and individual rationality (IR). Furthermore, we prove that under mild conditions, any other payment rule that also implements these training rules in DSIC can be converted to the affine maximizer payment by adding a factor irrelevant to the agents' own reports. We also show that this mechanism satisfies approximate DSIC when the input of the mechanism is a biased version of the reported preferences, showcasing its robustness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arena Learning: Build Data Flywheel for LLMs Post-training via Simulated Chatbot Arena](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10627v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) presents substantial challenges. The method of conducting human-annotated battles in an online Chatbot Arena is a highly effective evaluative technique. However, this approach is limited by the costs and time required for human annotation. In this paper, we introduce Arena Learning, an innovative offline strategy designed to simulate these arena battles using AI-driven annotations to evaluate battle outcomes, thus facilitating the continuous improvement of the target model through both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Arena Learning comprises two key elements. First, it ensures precise evaluations and maintains consistency between offline simulations and online competitions via WizardArena, a pipeline developed to accurately predict the Elo rankings of various models using a meticulously designed offline test set. Our results demonstrate that WizardArena's predictions closely align with those from the online Arena. Second, it involves the continuous improvement of training data based on the battle results and the refined model. We establish a data flywheel to iteratively update the training data by highlighting the weaknesses of the target model based on its battle results, enabling it to learn from the strengths of multiple different models. We apply Arena Learning to train our target model, WizardLM-$\beta$, and demonstrate significant performance enhancements across various metrics. This fully automated training and evaluation pipeline sets the stage for continuous advancements in various LLMs via post-training. Notably, Arena Learning plays a pivotal role in the success of WizardLM-2, and this paper serves both as an exploration of its efficacy and a foundational study for future discussions related to WizardLM-2 and its derivatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using LLMs for the Extraction and Normalization of Product Attribute Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02130v4)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Product offers on e-commerce websites often consist of a product title and a textual product description. In order to enable features such as faceted product search or to generate product comparison tables, it is necessary to extract structured attribute-value pairs from the unstructured product titles and descriptions and to normalize the extracted values to a single, unified scale for each attribute. This paper explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to extract and normalize attribute values from product titles and descriptions. We experiment with different zero-shot and few-shot prompt templates for instructing LLMs to extract and normalize attribute-value pairs. We introduce the Web Data Commons - Product Attribute Value Extraction (WDC-PAVE) benchmark dataset for our experiments. WDC-PAVE consists of product offers from 59 different websites which provide schema.org annotations. The offers belong to five different product categories, each with a specific set of attributes. The dataset provides manually verified attribute-value pairs in two forms: (i) directly extracted values and (ii) normalized attribute values. The normalization of the attribute values requires systems to perform the following types of operations: name expansion, generalization, unit of measurement conversion, and string wrangling. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-4 outperforms the PLM-based extraction methods SU-OpenTag, AVEQA, and MAVEQA by 10%, achieving an F1-score of 91%. For the extraction and normalization of product attribute values, GPT-4 achieves a similar performance to the extraction scenario, while being particularly strong at string wrangling and name expansion.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted at ADBIS2024</p></details> |

We leverage this capability of LLMs to generate task-specific data via zero-shot prompting and promote cross-lingual transfer for low-resource target languages. Given task-specific data in a source language and a teacher model trained on this data, we propose using this teacher to label LLM generations and employ a set of simple data selection strategies that use the teacher's label probabilities. Our data selection strategies help us identify a representative subset of diverse generations that help boost zero-shot accuracies while being efficient, in comparison to using all the LLM generations (without any subset selection). We also highlight other important design choices that affect cross-lingual performance such as the use of translations of source data and what labels are best to use for the LLM generations. We observe significant performance gains across sentiment analysis and natural language inference tasks (of up to a maximum of 7.13 absolute points and 1.5 absolute points on average) across a number of target languages (Hindi, Marathi, Urdu, Swahili) and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Findings of ACL 2024</p></details> |

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with scientific modalities has shown significant promise in this endeavour. However, challenges persist in effectively addressing training efficacy and the out-of-distribution problem, particularly as existing approaches rely on larger models and datasets. In this context, we focus on machine language-molecule translation and deploy a novel training approach called contrastive preference optimisation, which avoids generating translations that are merely adequate but not perfect. To ensure generalisability and mitigate memorisation effects, we conduct experiments using only 10% of the data. Our results demonstrate that our models achieve up to a 32% improvement compared to counterpart models. Finally, we introduce a fine-grained, domain-agnostic evaluation method to assess hallucination in LLMs and promote responsible use.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAPI: Towards Target-Specific and Adversarial Prompt Injection against Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely and successfully used to simplify and facilitate code programming. With these tools, developers can easily generate desired complete functional codes based on incomplete code and natural language prompts. However, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are also vulnerable, e.g., against backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former could induce LLMs to respond to triggers to insert malicious code snippets by poisoning the training data or model parameters, while the latter can craft malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of generated codes. However, both attack methods have underlying limitations: backdoor attacks rely on controlling the model training process, while adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes. To inherit the advantages of both backdoor and adversarial attacks, this paper proposes a new attack paradigm, i.e., target-specific and adversarial prompt injection (TAPI), against Code LLMs. TAPI generates unreadable comments containing information about malicious instructions and hides them as triggers in the external source code. When users exploit Code LLMs to complete codes containing the trigger, the models will generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at specific locations. We evaluate our TAPI attack on four representative LLMs under three representative malicious objectives and seven cases. The results show that our method is highly threatening (achieving an attack success rate enhancement of up to 89.3%) and stealthy (saving an average of 53.1% of tokens in the trigger design). In particular, we successfully attack some famous deployed code completion integrated applications, including CodeGeex and Github Copilot. This further confirms the realistic threat of our attack.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework, named CIBench, to comprehensively assess LLMs' ability to utilize code interpreters for data science tasks. Our evaluation framework includes an evaluation dataset and two evaluation modes. The evaluation dataset is constructed using an LLM-human cooperative approach and simulates an authentic workflow by leveraging consecutive and interactive IPython sessions. The two evaluation modes assess LLMs' ability with and without human assistance. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze the ability of 24 LLMs on CIBench and provide valuable insights for future LLMs in code interpreter utilization.</p></details> | Under review |

However, they are also more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks than their LLM predecessors. Although still capable of detecting the unsafe responses, we observe that safety mechanisms of the pre-aligned LLMs in MLLMs can be easily bypassed with the introduction of image features. To construct robust MLLMs, we propose ECSO (Eyes Closed, Safety On), a novel training-free protecting approach that exploits the inherent safety awareness of MLLMs, and generates safer responses via adaptively transforming unsafe images into texts to activate the intrinsic safety mechanism of pre-aligned LLMs in MLLMs. Experiments on five state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs demonstrate that ECSO enhances model safety significantly (e.g.,, 37.6% improvement on the MM-SafetyBench (SD+OCR) and 71.3% on VLSafe with LLaVA-1.5-7B), while consistently maintaining utility results on common MLLM benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that ECSO can be used as a data engine to generate supervised-finetuning (SFT) data for MLLM alignment without extra human intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024 (Project Page: https://gyhdog99.github.io/projects/ecso/)</p></details> |

This limits our understanding of LLM performance variability in real-world applications. Our study addresses this issue by exploring key questions about the performance differences between greedy decoding and sampling, identifying benchmarks' consistency regarding non-determinism, and examining unique model behaviors. Through extensive experiments, we observe that greedy decoding generally outperforms sampling methods for most evaluated tasks. We also observe consistent performance across different LLM sizes and alignment methods, noting that alignment can reduce sampling variance. Moreover, our best-of-N sampling approach demonstrates that smaller LLMs can match or surpass larger models such as GPT-4-Turbo, highlighting the untapped potential of smaller LLMs. This research shows the importance of considering non-determinism in LLM evaluations and provides insights for future LLM development and evaluation.</p></details> |  |

To increase the utilization effectively, we proposed a method of enhancing medication recommendation with Large Language Model (LLM) text representation. LLM harnesses powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, enabling the extraction of information from complex and lengthy unstructured data such as clinical notes which contain complex terminology. This method can be applied to several existing base models we selected and improve medication recommendation performance with the combination representation of text and medical codes experiments on two different datasets. LLM text representation alone can even demonstrate a comparable ability to the medical code representation alone. Overall, this is a general method that can be applied to other models for improved recommendations.</p></details> | 65 pages, 18 figures |

For this reason, models are both trained and instructed to refuse to answer unsafe prompts such as "Tell me how to build a bomb." We find that, despite these safeguards, it is possible to break model defenses simply by appending a space to the end of a model's input. In a study of eight open-source models, we demonstrate that this acts as a strong enough attack to cause the majority of models to generate harmful outputs with very high success rates. We examine the causes of this behavior, finding that the contexts in which single spaces occur in tokenized training data encourage models to generate lists when prompted, overriding training signals to refuse to answer unsafe requests. Our findings underscore the fragile state of current model alignment and promote the importance of developing more robust alignment methods.

Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in automatically generating code for general-purpose programming languages like Python. However, these methods fail on hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog due to the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning data, as even advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5 exhibit limited performance on Verilog generation. Regarding this issue, we observe that (1) Verilog code collected from the real world has higher quality than those generated by LLMs. (2) LLMs like GPT-3.5 excel in summarizing Verilog code rather than generating it. Based on these observations, this paper introduces CodeV, a series of open-source instruction-tuned Verilog generation LLMs. Instead of generating descriptions first and then getting the corresponding code from advanced LLMs, we prompt the LLM with Verilog code and let the LLM generate the corresponding natural language description by multi-level summarization. Experimental results show that CodeV relatively surpasses the previous open-source SOTA by 14.4% (BetterV in VerilogEval) and 11.3% (RTLCoder in RTLLM) respectively, and also relatively outperforms previous commercial SOTA GPT-4 by 22.1% in VerilogEval.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, over-provisioning resources to serve fluctuating request patterns is often prohibitively expensive. In this work, we present a best-effort serving system that employs deep reinforcement learning to adjust service quality based on the task distribution and system load. Our best-effort system can maintain availability with over 10x higher client request rates, serves above 96% of peak performance 4.1x more often, and serves above 98% of peak performance 2.3x more often than static serving on unpredictable workloads. Our learned router is robust to shifts in both the arrival and task distribution. Compared to static serving, learned best-effort serving allows for cost-efficient serving through increased hardware utility. Additionally, we argue that learned best-effort LLM serving is applicable in wide variety of settings and provides application developers great flexibility to meet their specific needs.</p></details> | Es-FoMo @ ICML 2024 |

However, simulating sensitive interactions, such as in mental health, is challenging. Privacy concerns restrict data access, and collecting expert feedback, although vital, is laborious. To address this, we develop Roleplay-doh, a novel human-LLM collaboration pipeline that elicits qualitative feedback from a domain-expert, which is transformed into a set of principles, or natural language rules, that govern an LLM-prompted roleplay. We apply this pipeline to enable senior mental health supporters to create customized AI patients for simulated practice partners for novice counselors. After uncovering issues in GPT-4 simulations not adhering to expert-defined principles, we also introduce a novel principle-adherence prompting pipeline which shows 30% improvements in response quality and principle following for the downstream task. Via a user study with 25 counseling experts, we demonstrate that the pipeline makes it easy and effective to create AI patients that more faithfully resemble real patients, as judged by creators and third-party counselors.

These applications underscore the need for LLM outputs to adhere to a specific format, for their integration with other components in the systems. Typically the format rules e.g., for data serialization formats such as JSON, YAML, or Code in Programming Language are expressed as context-free grammar (CFG). Due to the hallucinations and unreliability of LLMs, instructing LLMs to adhere to specified syntax becomes an increasingly important challenge. We present SynCode, a novel framework for efficient and general syntactical decoding with LLMs, to address this challenge. SynCode ensures soundness and completeness with respect to the CFG of a formal language, effectively retaining valid tokens while filtering out invalid ones. SynCode uses an offline-constructed, efficient lookup table, the DFA mask store, derived from the DFA of the language's grammar for efficient generation. SynCode seamlessly integrates with any language defined by CFG, as evidenced by experiments focusing on generating JSON, Python, and Go outputs. Our experiments evaluating the effectiveness of SynCode for JSON generation demonstrate that SynCode eliminates all syntax errors and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our results underscore how SynCode significantly reduces 96.07% of syntax errors in generated Python and Go code, showcasing its substantial impact on enhancing syntactical precision in LLM generation.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiasAlert significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods like GPT4-as-A-Judge in detecting bias. Furthermore, through application studies, we demonstrate the utility of BiasAlert in reliable LLM bias evaluation and bias mitigation across various scenarios.

Despite the tremendous success of LLMs in many downstream tasks, they suffer from severe hallucination problems, posing significant challenges to the practical applications of LLMs. Most of the works about LLMs' hallucinations focus on data quality. Self-attention is a core module in transformer-based LLMs, while its potential relationship with LLMs' hallucination has been hardly investigated. To fill this gap, we study this problem from a causal perspective. We propose a method to intervene in LLMs' self-attention layers and maintain their structures and sizes intact. Specifically, we disable different self-attention layers in several popular open-source LLMs and then compare their degrees of hallucination with the original ones. We evaluate the intervened LLMs on hallucination assessment benchmarks and conclude that disabling some specific self-attention layers in the front or tail of the LLMs can alleviate hallucination issues. The study paves a new way for understanding and mitigating LLMs' hallucinations.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[LLM-Assisted Multi-Teacher Continual Learning for Visual Question Answering in Robotic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16664v2)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual question answering (VQA) is crucial for promoting surgical education. In practice, the needs of trainees are constantly evolving, such as learning more surgical types, adapting to different robots, and learning new surgical instruments and techniques for various surgeries. However, patient data privacy often restricts the availability of old data when updating the model, necessitating an exemplar-free continual learning (CL) setup. Prior CL studies overlooked two vital problems in the surgical domain: 1) large domain shifts from diverse surgical operations collected from multiple sources, and 2) severe data imbalance arising from the uneven presence of surgical instruments or activities. This paper proposes addressing these problems with a multimodal large language model (LLM) and an adaptive weight assignment methodology. We first develop a new multi-teacher CL framework that leverages a multimodal LLM as the additional teacher. The strong generalization ability of the LLM can bridge the knowledge gap when domain shifts and data imbalances occur. We then put forth a novel data processing method that transforms complex LLM embeddings into logits compatible with our CL framework. We further design an adaptive weight assignment approach that balances the generalization ability of the LLM and the domain expertise of the old CL model. Finally, to comprehensively test the effectiveness of our proposed method, we have also constructed two new surgical VQA datasets that are largely different from existing ones and could be valuable resources for future research. Extensive experimental results on the tested datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method to other advanced CL schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accapted by 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a new horizon for redefining recommender systems with vast general knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Standing across this LLM era, we aim to integrate recommender systems into a broader picture, and pave the way for more comprehensive solutions for future research. Therefore, we first offer a comprehensive overview of the technical progression of recommender systems, particularly focusing on language foundation models and their applications in recommendation. We identify two evolution paths of modern recommender systems -- via list-wise recommendation and conversational recommendation. These two paths finally converge at LLM agents with superior capabilities of long-term memory, reflection, and tool intelligence. Along these two paths, we point out that the information effectiveness of the recommendation is increased, while the user's acquisition cost is decreased. Technical features, research methodologies, and inherent challenges for each milestone along the path are carefully investigated -- from traditional list-wise recommendation to LLM-enhanced recommendation to recommendation with LLM agents. Finally, we highlight several unresolved challenges crucial for the development of future personalization technologies and interfaces and discuss the future prospects.</p></details> |  |

Constructing LLM-based agents is considered to be one of the most effective tools to achieve this goal. Agent, as a kind of human-like intelligent entity with the ability of perception, planning, decision-making, and action, has created great production value in many fields. However, the bridge O\&M field shows a relatively low level of intelligence compared to other industries. Nevertheless, the bridge O\&M field has developed numerous intelligent inspection devices, machine learning algorithms, and autonomous evaluation and decision-making methods, which provide a feasible basis for breakthroughs in artificial intelligence in this field. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of AI bodies based on large-scale language models on the field of bridge O\&M and to analyze the potential challenges and opportunities it brings to the core tasks of bridge O\&M. Through in-depth research and analysis, this paper expects to provide a more comprehensive perspective for understanding the application of intelligentsia in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, these models can inadvertently memorize private information, posing significant privacy risks. This study addresses the challenge of enabling LLMs to protect specific individuals' private data without the need for complete retraining. We propose \return, a Real-world pErsonal daTa UnleaRNing dataset, comprising 2,492 individuals from Wikipedia with associated QA pairs, to evaluate machine unlearning (MU) methods for protecting personal data in a realistic scenario. Additionally, we introduce the Name-Aware Unlearning Framework (NAUF) for Privacy Protection, which enables the model to learn which individuals' information should be protected without affecting its ability to answer questions related to other unrelated individuals. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NAUF achieves a state-of-the-art average unlearning score, surpassing the best baseline method by 5.65 points, effectively protecting target individuals' personal data while maintaining the model's general capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present ORAN-Bench-13K, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of O-RAN. Our benchmark consists of 13,952 meticulously curated multiple-choice questions generated from 116 O-RAN specification documents. We leverage a novel three-stage LLM framework, and the questions are categorized into three distinct difficulties to cover a wide spectrum of ORAN-related knowledge. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs, including Gemini, Chat-GPT, and Mistral. Additionally, we propose ORANSight, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based pipeline that demonstrates superior performance on ORAN-Bench-13K compared to other tested closed-source models. Our findings indicate that current popular LLM models are not proficient in O-RAN, highlighting the need for specialized models. We observed a noticeable performance improvement when incorporating the RAG-based ORANSight pipeline, with a Macro Accuracy of 0.784 and a Weighted Accuracy of 0.776, which was on average 21.55% and 22.59% better than the other tested LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The outcomes causality extraction from Clinical Practice Guidelines for gestational diabetes are presented, marking a first in the field. We report on a set of experiments using variants of BERT (BioBERT, DistilBERT, and BERT) and using Large Language Models (LLMs), namely GPT-4 and LLAMA2. Our experiments show that BioBERT performed better than other models, including the Large Language Models, with an average F1-score of 0.72. GPT-4 and LLAMA2 results show similar performance but less consistency. We also release the code and an annotated a corpus of causal statements within the Clinical Practice Guidelines for gestational diabetes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs for Optimization Modeling and Enhancing Reasoning via Reverse Socratic Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09887v1)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited their problem-solving ability in mathematical reasoning. Solving realistic optimization (OPT) problems in industrial application scenarios requires advanced and applied math ability. However, current OPT benchmarks that merely solve linear programming are far from complex realistic situations. In this work, we propose E-OPT, a benchmark for end-to-end optimization problem-solving with human-readable inputs and outputs. E-OPT contains rich optimization problems, including linear/nonlinear programming with/without table data, which can comprehensively evaluate LLMs' solving ability. In our benchmark, LLMs are required to correctly understand the problem in E-OPT and call code solver to get precise numerical answers. Furthermore, to alleviate the data scarcity for optimization problems, and to bridge the gap between open-source LLMs on a small scale (e.g., Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8b) and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), we further propose a novel data synthesis method namely ReSocratic. Unlike general data synthesis methods that proceed from questions to answers, ReSocratic first incrementally synthesizes optimization scenarios with mathematical formulations step by step and then back-translates the generated scenarios into questions. In such a way, we construct the ReSocratic-29k dataset from a small seed sample pool with the powerful open-source large model DeepSeek-V2. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ReSocratic, we conduct supervised fine-tuning with ReSocratic-29k on multiple open-source models. The results show that Llama3-8b is significantly improved from 13.6% to 51.7% on E-OPT, while DeepSeek-V2 reaches 61.0%, approaching 65.5% of GPT-4.</p></details> |  |

Despite the numerous QA datasets that have been developed, there is a notable lack of region-specific datasets generated by native users in their own languages. This gap hinders the effective benchmarking of LLMs for regional and cultural specificities. In this study, we propose a scalable framework, NativQA, to seamlessly construct culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages, for LLM evaluation and tuning. Moreover, to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we designed a multilingual natural QA dataset, MultiNativQA, consisting of ~72K QA pairs in seven languages, ranging from high to extremely low resource, based on queries from native speakers covering 18 topics. We benchmark the MultiNativQA dataset with open- and closed-source LLMs. We made both the framework NativQA and MultiNativQA dataset publicly available for the community.

However, manual manipulation of various tools to achieve desired outcomes can be labor-intensive for researchers. To address this, we introduce CellAgent (http://cell.agent4science.cn/), an LLM-driven multi-agent framework, specifically designed for the automatic processing and execution of scRNA-seq data analysis tasks, providing high-quality results with no human intervention. Firstly, to adapt general LLMs to the biological field, CellAgent constructs LLM-driven biological expert roles - planner, executor, and evaluator - each with specific responsibilities. Then, CellAgent introduces a hierarchical decision-making mechanism to coordinate these biological experts, effectively driving the planning and step-by-step execution of complex data analysis tasks. Furthermore, we propose a self-iterative optimization mechanism, enabling CellAgent to autonomously evaluate and optimize solutions, thereby guaranteeing output quality. We evaluate CellAgent on a comprehensive benchmark dataset encompassing dozens of tissues and hundreds of distinct cell types. Evaluation results consistently show that CellAgent effectively identifies the most suitable tools and hyperparameters for single-cell analysis tasks, achieving optimal performance. This automated framework dramatically reduces the workload for science data analyses, bringing us into the "Agent for Science" era.</p></details> |  |

The rapid development of LLMs calls for a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for swift evaluation deployment. However, considering various implementation details, developing a comprehensive evaluation platform is never easy. Existing platforms are often complex and poorly modularized, hindering seamless incorporation into research workflows. This paper introduces UltraEval, a user-friendly evaluation framework characterized by its lightweight nature, comprehensiveness, modularity, and efficiency. We identify and reimplement three core components of model evaluation (models, data, and metrics). The resulting composability allows for the free combination of different models, tasks, prompts, benchmarks, and metrics within a unified evaluation workflow. Additionally, UltraEval supports diverse models owing to a unified HTTP service and provides sufficient inference acceleration.

While many real-world applications still require fine-tuning to reach satisfactory levels of performance, many of them are in the low-data regime, making fine-tuning challenging. To address this, we propose LLM2LLM, a targeted and iterative data augmentation strategy that uses a teacher LLM to enhance a small seed dataset by augmenting additional data that can be used for fine-tuning on a specific task. LLM2LLM (1) fine-tunes a baseline student LLM on the initial seed data, (2) evaluates and extracts data points that the model gets wrong, and (3) uses a teacher LLM to generate synthetic data based on these incorrect data points, which are then added back into the training data. This approach amplifies the signal from incorrectly predicted data points by the LLM during training and reintegrates them into the dataset to focus on more challenging examples for the LLM. Our results show that LLM2LLM significantly enhances the performance of LLMs in the low-data regime, outperforming both traditional fine-tuning and other data augmentation baselines. LLM2LLM reduces the dependence on labor-intensive data curation and paves the way for more scalable and performant LLM solutions, allowing us to tackle data-constrained domains and tasks. We achieve improvements up to 24.2% on the GSM8K dataset, 32.6% on CaseHOLD, 32.0% on SNIPS, 52.6% on TREC and 39.8% on SST-2 over regular fine-tuning in the low-data regime using a Llama-2-7B student model.

However, this task can be challenging as the audience often lacks specific knowledge about the presented research. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that integrates three LLMs mimicking the real-world writing-reading-feedback-revision workflow, with one LLM acting as the journalist, a smaller LLM as the general public reader, and the third LLM as an editor. The journalist's writing is iteratively refined by feedback from the reader and suggestions from the editor. Our experiments demonstrate that by leveraging the collaboration of two 7B and one 1.8B open-source LLMs, we can generate articles that are more accessible than those generated by existing methods, including advanced models such as GPT-4.</p></details> | Under review |

We introduce CloudAPIBench, a new benchmark designed to measure API hallucination occurrences. CloudAPIBench also provides annotations for frequencies of API occurrences in the public domain, allowing us to study API hallucinations at various frequency levels. Our findings reveal that Code LLMs struggle with low frequency APIs: for e.g., GPT-4o achieves only 38.58% valid low frequency API invocations. We demonstrate that Documentation Augmented Generation (DAG) significantly improves performance for low frequency APIs (increase to 47.94% with DAG) but negatively impacts high frequency APIs when using sub-optimal retrievers (a 39.02% absolute drop). To mitigate this, we propose to intelligently trigger DAG where we check against an API index or leverage Code LLMs' confidence scores to retrieve only when needed. We demonstrate that our proposed methods enhance the balance between low and high frequency API performance, resulting in more reliable API invocations (8.20% absolute improvement on CloudAPIBench for GPT-4o).</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from seminal works in psycholinguistics, particularly the study of gender's influence on language perception, we leverage multilingual LLMs to revisit and expand upon the foundational experiments of Boroditsky (2003). Employing LLMs as a novel method for examining psycholinguistic biases related to grammatical gender, we prompt a model to describe nouns with adjectives in various languages, focusing specifically on languages with grammatical gender. In particular, we look at adjective co-occurrences across gender and languages, and train a binary classifier to predict grammatical gender given adjectives an LLM uses to describe a noun. Surprisingly, we find that a simple classifier can not only predict noun gender above chance but also exhibit cross-language transferability. We show that while LLMs may describe words differently in different languages, they are biased similarly.</p></details> |  |

The Puzzling Lack of Language Policy in China's LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09652v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary language models are increasingly multilingual, but Chinese LLM developers must navigate complex political and business considerations of language diversity. Language policy in China aims at influencing the public discourse and governing a multi-ethnic society, and has gradually transitioned from a pluralist to a more assimilationist approach since 1949. We explore the impact of these influences on current language technology. We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs pre-trained by Chinese companies on 18 languages, spanning a wide range of Chinese, Asian, and Anglo-European languages. Our experiments show Chinese LLMs performance on diverse languages is indistinguishable from international LLMs. Similarly, the models' technical reports also show lack of consideration for pretraining data language coverage except for English and Mandarin Chinese. Examining Chinese AI policy, model experiments, and technical reports, we find no sign of any consistent policy, either for or against, language diversity in China's LLM development. This leaves a puzzling fact that while China regulates both the languages people use daily as well as language model development, they do not seem to have any policy on the languages in language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Wen-Y...</summary><p>Wen-Yi and Jo contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Our goal is to present the methodologies employed in developing these systems, utilizing large language models such as LLama and Gemma. In the field of ASR, we explore the utilization of the Whisper model for code-switched Egyptian Arabic recognition, detailing our experimental procedures including data preprocessing and training techniques. Through the implementation of a consecutive speech-to-text translation system that integrates ASR with MT, we aim to overcome challenges posed by limited resources and the unique characteristics of the Egyptian Arabic dialect. Evaluation against established metrics showcases promising results, with our methodologies yielding a significant improvement of $56\%$ in English translation over the state-of-the-art and $9.3\%$ in Arabic translation. Since code-switching is deeply inherent in spoken languages, it is crucial that ASR systems can effectively handle this phenomenon. This capability is crucial for enabling seamless interaction in various domains, including business negotiations, cultural exchanges, and academic discourse.

However, the majority of these works focus on producing short video clips of a single event (i.e., single-scene videos). Meanwhile, recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capability in generating layouts and programs to control downstream visual modules. This prompts an important question: can we leverage the knowledge embedded in these LLMs for temporally consistent long video generation? In this paper, we propose VideoDirectorGPT, a novel framework for consistent multi-scene video generation that uses the knowledge of LLMs for video content planning and grounded video generation. Specifically, given a single text prompt, we first ask our video planner LLM (GPT-4) to expand it into a 'video plan', which includes the scene descriptions, the entities with their respective layouts, the background for each scene, and consistency groupings of the entities. Next, guided by this video plan, our video generator, named Layout2Vid, has explicit control over spatial layouts and can maintain temporal consistency of entities across multiple scenes, while being trained only with image-level annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed VideoDirectorGPT framework substantially improves layout and movement control in both single- and multi-scene video generation and can generate multi-scene videos with consistency, while achieving competitive performance with SOTAs in open-domain single-scene T2V generation. Detailed ablation studies, including dynamic adjustment of layout control strength with an LLM and video generation with user-provided images, confirm the effectiveness of each component of our framework and its future potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2024; Project page: https://videodirectorgpt.github.io</p></details> |

Due to their world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, LLM agents achieve stronger performance than previous smaller agents based on reinforcement learning (RL); however, frequently calling LLMs is slow and expensive. Instead of directly employing LLMs as agents, can we use LLMs' reasoning capabilities to adaptively create training environments to help smaller RL agents learn useful skills that they are weak at? We propose EnvGen, a novel framework to address this question. We first prompt an LLM to generate training environments by giving it the task description and simulator objectives that the agents should learn and then asking it to generate a set of environment configurations (e.g., different terrains, items initially given to agents, etc.). Next, we train a small RL agent in a mixture of the original and LLM-generated environments. Then, we enable the LLM to continuously adapt the generated environments to progressively improve the skills that the agent is weak at, by providing feedback to the LLM in the form of the agent's performance. We demonstrate the usefulness of EnvGen with comprehensive experiments in Crafter and Heist environments. We find that a small RL agent trained with EnvGen can outperform SOTA methods, including a GPT-4 agent, and learns long-horizon tasks significantly faster. We also show that using an LLM to adapt environments dynamically outperforms curriculum learning approaches and how the environments are adapted to help improve RL agents' weaker skills over time. Additionally, EnvGen is substantially more efficient as it only uses a small number of LLM calls (e.g., 4 in total), whereas LLM agents require thousands of calls. Lastly, we present detailed ablation studies for EnvGen design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2024; First two authors contributed equally; Project website: https://envgen-llm.github.io/</p></details> |

In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an on-line fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench dataset demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art InfLLM model with an overall relative improvement of 4.3% across various tasks, including a 33% improvement on the PassageRetrieval task. Furthermore, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart. This work not only advances LLM capabilities in processing extended contexts but also provides a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms, opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research in AI and cognitive science.</p></details> |  |

When updating models, developers often focus on increasing overall performance metrics with less emphasis on being compatible with previous model versions. However, users often build a mental model of the functionality and capabilities of a particular machine learning model they are interacting with. They have to adapt their mental model with every update -- a draining task that can lead to user dissatisfaction. In practice, fine-tuned downstream task adapters rely on pretrained LLM base models. When these base models are updated, these user-facing downstream task models experience instance regression or negative flips -- previously correct instances are now predicted incorrectly. This happens even when the downstream task training procedures remain identical. Our work aims to provide seamless model updates to a user in two ways. First, we provide evaluation metrics for a notion of compatibility to prior model versions, specifically for generative tasks but also applicable for discriminative tasks. We observe regression and inconsistencies between different model versions on a diverse set of tasks and model updates. Second, we propose a training strategy to minimize the number of inconsistencies in model updates, involving training of a compatibility model that can enhance task fine-tuned language models. We reduce negative flips -- instances where a prior model version was correct, but a new model incorrect -- by up to 40% from Llama 1 to Llama 2.</p></details> |  |

This issue is especially concerning in healthcare, as clinicians are unlikely to be experienced prompt engineers and the potential consequences of inaccurate outputs are heightened in this domain. This raises a practical question: How robust are instruction-tuned LLMs to natural variations in the instructions provided for clinical NLP tasks? We collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the sensitivity of seven LLMs -- some general, others specialized -- to natural (i.e., non-adversarial) instruction phrasings. We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that -- perhaps surprisingly -- domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts. Further, arbitrary phrasing differences can affect fairness, e.g., valid but distinct instructions for mortality prediction yield a range both in overall performance, and in terms of differences between demographic groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at BioNLP, ACL 2024</p></details> |

In this paper we study debate, where two AI's compete to convince a judge; consultancy, where a single AI tries to convince a judge that asks questions; and compare to a baseline of direct question-answering, where the judge just answers outright without the AI. We use large language models (LLMs) as both AI agents and as stand-ins for human judges, taking the judge models to be weaker than agent models. We benchmark on a diverse range of asymmetries between judges and agents, extending previous work on a single extractive QA task with information asymmetry, to also include mathematics, coding, logic and multimodal reasoning asymmetries. We find that debate outperforms consultancy across all tasks when the consultant is randomly assigned to argue for the correct/incorrect answer. Comparing debate to direct question answering, the results depend on the type of task: in extractive QA tasks with information asymmetry debate outperforms direct question answering, but in other tasks without information asymmetry the results are mixed. Previous work assigned debaters/consultants an answer to argue for. When we allow them to instead choose which answer to argue for, we find judges are less frequently convinced by the wrong answer in debate than in consultancy. Further, we find that stronger debater models increase judge accuracy, though more modestly than in previous studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages (53 including appendices).

| **[Beyond static AI evaluations: advancing human interaction evaluations for LLM harms and risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10632v5)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model evaluations are central to understanding the safety, risks, and societal impacts of AI systems. While most real-world AI applications involve human-AI interaction, most current evaluations (e.g., common benchmarks) of AI models do not. Instead, they incorporate human factors in limited ways, assessing the safety of models in isolation, thereby falling short of capturing the complexity of human-model interactions. In this paper, we discuss and operationalize a definition of an emerging category of evaluations -- "human interaction evaluations" (HIEs) -- which focus on the assessment of human-model interactions or the process and the outcomes of humans using models. First, we argue that HIEs can be used to increase the validity of safety evaluations, assess direct human impact and interaction-specific harms, and guide future assessments of models' societal impact. Second, we propose a safety-focused HIE design framework -- containing a human-LLM interaction taxonomy -- with three stages: (1) identifying the risk or harm area, (2) characterizing the use context, and (3) choosing the evaluation parameters. Third, we apply our framework to two potential evaluations for overreliance and persuasion risks. Finally, we conclude with tangible recommendations for addressing concerns over costs, replicability, and unrepresentativeness of HIEs.</p></details> | revised figure |

They can also be used to introduce a diverse group discussion step in chatbot pipelines, enhancing the cultural sensitivity of the chatbot's responses. These applications, however, are predicated on the ability of AI agents to reliably adopt assigned personas and mimic human interactions. To evaluate the ability of LLM agents to satisfy these requirements, we examine AI agent ensembles engaged in cultural collaboration and debate by analyzing their private responses and chat transcripts. Our findings suggest that multi-agent discussions can encourage collective decisions that reflect diverse perspectives, yet this benefit is tempered by the agents' susceptibility to conformity due to perceived peer pressure and challenges in maintaining consistent personas and opinions. Instructions that encourage debate in support of one's opinions rather than collaboration increase the rate of inconstancy. Without addressing the factors we identify, the full potential of multi-agent frameworks for producing more culturally diverse AI outputs or more realistic simulations of group decision-making will remain untapped.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, online catalogues merely offer descriptive metadata for these documents, relegating discussions about their authenticity to free-text formats, making it difficult to study these assessments at scale. This study explores the generation of structured data about documents' authenticity assessment from natural language texts. Our pipeline exploits Large Language Models (LLMs) to select, extract and classify relevant claims about the topic without the need for training, and Semantic Web technologies to structure and type-validate the LLM's results. The final output is a catalogue of documents whose authenticity has been debated, along with scholars' opinions on their authenticity. This process can serve as a valuable resource for integration into catalogues, allowing room for more intricate queries and analyses on the evolution of these debates over centuries.</p></details> |  |

Previous machine learning approaches to PPI prediction mainly focus on direct physical interactions, ignoring the broader context of nonphysical connections through intermediate proteins, thus limiting their effectiveness. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a new opportunity for addressing this complex biological challenge. By transforming structured data into natural language prompts, we can map the relationships between proteins into texts. This approach allows LLMs to identify indirect connections between proteins, tracing the path from upstream to downstream. Therefore, we propose a novel framework ProLLM that employs an LLM tailored for PPI for the first time. Specifically, we propose Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT), which replicates the biological mechanism of signaling pathways as natural language prompts. ProCoT considers a signaling pathway as a protein reasoning process, which starts from upstream proteins and passes through several intermediate proteins to transmit biological signals to downstream proteins. Thus, we can use ProCoT to predict the interaction between upstream proteins and downstream proteins. The training of ProLLM employs the ProCoT format, which enhances the model's understanding of complex biological problems. In addition to ProCoT, this paper also contributes to the exploration of embedding replacement of protein sites in natural language prompts, and instruction fine-tuning in protein knowledge datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of ProLLM through rigorous validation against benchmark datasets, showing significant improvement over existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalizability.

Prior systems used to reserve KV-cache memory ahead-of-time that resulted in wasted capacity due to internal fragmentation. Inspired by demand paging, vLLM proposed PagedAttention to enable dynamic memory allocation for KV-cache. This approach eliminates fragmentation and improves serving throughout. However, to be able to allocate physical memory dynamically, PagedAttention changes the layout of KV-cache from contiguous virtual memory to non-contiguous virtual memory. As a consequence, one needs to rewrite the attention kernels to support paging, and implement a memory manager in the serving framework. This results in both performance and programming overheads, as well as portability challenges in adopting state-of-the-art attention kernels. In this paper, we propose vAttention, a new approach for dynamic KV-cache memory management. In contrast to PagedAttention, vAttention stores KV-cache in contiguous virtual memory and leverages OS support for on-demand allocation of physical memory. vAttention thus enables one to use state-of-the art attention kernels out-of-the-box by adding support for dynamic allocation of physical memory without having to re-write their code. We implement vAttention in the vLLM serving stack to show that it also helps improve decode throughput by up to 1.99x over vLLM, and the end-to-end serving throughput by up to 1.22x and 1.29x, compared to using the state-of-the-art PagedAttention based kernels of FlashAttention and FlashInfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 13 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

We introduce a novel approach, Decoupled Refusal Training (DeRTa), designed to empower LLMs to refuse compliance to harmful prompts at any response position, significantly enhancing their safety capabilities. DeRTa incorporates two novel components: (1) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Harmful Response Prefix, which trains models to recognize and avoid unsafe content by appending a segment of harmful response to the beginning of a safe response, and (2) Reinforced Transition Optimization (RTO), which equips models with the ability to transition from potential harm to safety refusal consistently throughout the harmful response sequence. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using LLaMA3 and Mistral model families across six attack scenarios, demonstrates that our method not only improves model safety without compromising performance but also surpasses well-known models such as GPT-4 in defending against attacks. Importantly, our approach successfully defends recent advanced attack methods (e.g., CodeAttack) that have jailbroken GPT-4 and LLaMA3-70B-Instruct. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/RobustNLP/DeRTa.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their development in understanding spatial-temporal data has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-LLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{LLM}s, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-LLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers as well as virtual nodes. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for LLMs to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data. Additionally, to capture the non-pairwise and higher-order correlations, we design a hypergraph learning module for LLMs, which can enhance the overall performance and improve efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-LLM exhibits strong performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-LLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

The prediction of deep neural networks must contain errors, it is required to update the trained model to correspond to the real environment to generate robot motion adaptively. This study proposes an integration method that connects the robot-motion learning model and LLM using shared latent variables. When generating robot motion, the proposed method updates shared parameters based on prediction errors from both sensorimotor attention points and task language instructions given to the robot. This allows the model to search for latent parameters appropriate for the robot task efficiently. Through simulator experiments on multiple robot tasks, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method from two perspectives: position generalization and language instruction generalization abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, accepted at IROS 2024</p></details> |

Studies indicate that assigning LLMs the roles of experts, a strategy known as role-play prompting, can enhance their performance in the corresponding domains. However, the prompt needs to be manually designed for the given problem, requiring certain expertise and iterative modifications. To this end, we propose self-prompt tuning, making LLMs themselves generate role-play prompts through fine-tuning. Leveraging the LIMA dataset as our foundational corpus, we employ GPT-4 to annotate role-play prompts for each data points, resulting in the creation of the LIMA-Role dataset. We then fine-tune LLMs like Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B on LIMA-Role. Consequently, the self-prompt tuned LLMs can automatically generate expert role prompts for any given question. We extensively evaluate self-prompt tuned LLMs on widely used NLP benchmarks and open-ended question test. Our empirical results illustrate that self-prompt tuned LLMs outperform standard instruction tuned baselines across most datasets. This highlights the great potential of utilizing fine-tuning to enable LLMs to self-prompt, thereby automating complex prompting strategies. We release the dataset, models, and code at this \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Self-Prompt-Tuning-739E/}{url}.</p></details> |  |

However, properly written text is rarely found in real-world scenarios and hence, oftentimes invalidates the aforementioned foundational assumption. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance, but can they handle the inevitable noise in real-world data? This work tackles this critical question by investigating LLMs' resilience against morphological variations in text. To that end, we artificially introduce varying levels of noise into a diverse set of datasets and systematically evaluate LLMs' robustness against the corrupt variations of the original text. Our findings show that contrary to popular beliefs, generative LLMs are quiet robust to noisy perturbations in text. This is a departure from pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa whose performance has been shown to be sensitive to deteriorating noisy text. Additionally, we test LLMs' resilience on multiple real-world benchmarks that closely mimic commonly found errors in the wild. With minimal prompting, LLMs achieve a new state-of-the-art on the benchmark tasks of Grammar Error Correction (GEC) and Lexical Semantic Change (LSC). To empower future research, we also release a dataset annotated by humans stating their preference for LLM vs. human-corrected outputs along with the code to reproduce our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 6 tables, updated with results also from GPT-4, LLaMa-3</p></details> |
| **[Towards More Trustworthy and Interpretable LLMs for Code through Syntax-Grounded Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08983v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness and interpretability are inextricably linked concepts for LLMs. The more interpretable an LLM is, the more trustworthy it becomes. However, current techniques for interpreting LLMs when applied to code-related tasks largely focus on accuracy measurements, measures of how models react to change, or individual task performance instead of the fine-grained explanations needed at prediction time for greater interpretability, and hence trust. To improve upon this status quo, this paper introduces ASTrust, an interpretability method for LLMs of code that generates explanations grounded in the relationship between model confidence and syntactic structures of programming languages. ASTrust explains generated code in the context of syntax categories based on Abstract Syntax Trees and aids practitioners in understanding model predictions at both local (individual code snippets) and global (larger datasets of code) levels. By distributing and assigning model confidence scores to well-known syntactic structures that exist within ASTs, our approach moves beyond prior techniques that perform token-level confidence mapping by offering a view of model confidence that directly aligns with programming language concepts with which developers are familiar. To put ASTrust into practice, we developed an automated visualization that illustrates the aggregated model confidence scores superimposed on sequence, heat-map, and graph-based visuals of syntactic structures from ASTs. We examine both the practical benefit that ASTrust can provide through a data science study on 12 popular LLMs on a curated set of GitHub repos and the usefulness of ASTrust through a human study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review to appear in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

However, they encounter difficulties in understanding and working with code produced by LLMs. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel workflow into computational notebooks that augments LLM-based code generation with an additional ephemeral UI step, offering users UI scaffolds as an intermediate stage between user prompts and code generation. We present this workflow in BISCUIT, an extension for JupyterLab that provides users with ephemeral UIs generated by LLMs based on the context of their code and intentions, scaffolding users to understand, guide, and explore with LLM-generated code. Through a user study where 10 novices used BISCUIT for machine learning tutorials, we found that BISCUIT offers users representations of code to aid their understanding, reduces the complexity of prompt engineering, and creates a playground for users to explore different variables and iterate on their ideas.</p></details> |  |

This task has garnered increased attention due to the widespread dissemination and harmful impact of fake news on social media. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated competitive performance with the help of their rich prior knowledge and excellent in-context learning abilities. However, existing methods face significant limitations, such as the Understanding Ambiguity and Information Scarcity, which significantly undermine the potential of LLMs. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Dual-perspective Augmented Fake News Detection (DAFND) model, designed to enhance LLMs from both inside and outside perspectives. Specifically, DAFND first identifies the keywords of each news article through a Detection Module. Subsequently, DAFND creatively designs an Investigation Module to retrieve inside and outside valuable information concerning to the current news, followed by another Judge Module to derive its respective two prediction results. Finally, a Determination Module further integrates these two predictions and derives the final result. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets show the efficacy of our proposed method, particularly in low-resource settings.</p></details> |  |

Extensive work has been done to deal with the OVD for 2D RGB images, but the exploration of 3D OVD is still limited. Intuitively, lidar point clouds provide 3D information, both object level and scene level, to generate trustful detection results. However, previous lidar-based OVD methods only focus on the usage of object-level features, ignoring the essence of scene-level information. In this paper, we propose a Global-Local Collaborative Scheme (GLIS) for the lidar-based OVD task, which contains a local branch to generate object-level detection result and a global branch to obtain scene-level global feature. With the global-local information, a Large Language Model (LLM) is applied for chain-of-thought inference, and the detection result can be refined accordingly. We further propose Reflected Pseudo Labels Generation (RPLG) to generate high-quality pseudo labels for supervision and Background-Aware Object Localization (BAOL) to select precise object proposals.

Existing solutions rely on heuristics or leverage machine learning techniques, but only achieve limited successes. Fundamentally, such obfuscation cannot be defeated without in-depth understanding of the binary executable's semantics, which is made possible by the emergence of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present DisasLLM, a novel LLM-driven dissembler to overcome the challenge in analyzing obfuscated executables. DisasLLM consists of two components: an LLM-based classifier that determines whether an instruction in an assembly code snippet is correctly decoded, and a disassembly strategy that leverages this model to disassemble obfuscated executables end-to-end. We evaluated DisasLLM on a set of heavily obfuscated executables, which is shown to significantly outperform other state-of-the-art disassembly solutions.</p></details> |  |

To deploy LLMs as AI assistants, it is crucial that these models exhibit desirable behavioral traits, such as non-toxicity and resilience against jailbreak attempts. Current methods for detoxification or preventing jailbreaking usually involve Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which requires finetuning billions of parameters through gradient descent with substantial computation cost. Furthermore, models modified through SFT and RLHF may deviate from the pretrained models, potentially leading to a degradation in foundational LLM capabilities. In this paper, we observe that surprisingly, directly editing a small subset of parameters can effectively modulate specific behaviors of LLMs, such as detoxification and resistance to jailbreaking. Specifically, for a behavior that we aim to avoid, we employ a linear classifier, which we term the behavior probe, to classify binary behavior labels within the hidden state space of the LLM. Using this probe, we introduce an algorithm to identify a critical subset of LLM parameters that significantly influence this targeted behavior. Then we directly edit these selected parameters by shifting them towards the behavior probe. Such a direct parameter editing method necessitates only inference-level computational resources. Experiments demonstrate that in the representative detoxification task, our approach achieves reductions of up to 90.0\% in toxicity on the RealToxicityPrompts dataset and 49.2\% on ToxiGen, while maintaining the LLM's general capabilities in areas such as common sense, question answering, and mathematics.

Recent studies have explored hallucinations through the lens of internal representations, proposing mechanisms to decipher LLMs' adherence to facts. However, these approaches often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, leading to concerns about whether internal representation patterns reflect fundamental factual awareness, or only overfit spurious correlations on the specific datasets. In this work, we investigate whether a universal truthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model's factually correct and incorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number of training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation -- we train the truthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine its cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results indicate that increasing the diversity of the training datasets significantly enhances the performance in all scenarios, while the volume of data samples plays a less critical role. This finding supports the optimistic hypothesis that a universal truthfulness hyperplane may indeed exist within the model, offering promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are also prone to generate nonfactual content. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is pivotal in enhancing our understanding of a model's confidence on its generation, thereby aiding in the mitigation of nonfactual outputs. Existing research on UQ predominantly targets short text generation, typically yielding brief, word-limited responses. However, real-world applications frequently necessitate much longer responses. Our study first highlights the limitations of current UQ methods in handling long text generation. We then introduce \textsc{Luq} and its two variations, a series of novel sampling-based UQ approaches specifically designed for long text. Our findings reveal that \textsc{Luq} outperforms existing baseline methods in correlating with the model's factuality scores (negative coefficient of -0.85 observed for Gemini Pro). To further improve the factuality of LLM responses, we propose \textsc{Luq-Ensemble}, a method that ensembles responses from multiple models and selects the response with the lowest uncertainty. The ensembling method greatly improves the response factuality upon the best standalone LLM.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally considered distinct paradigms, connectionist AI focuses on neural networks, while symbolic AI emphasizes symbolic representation and logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, highlight the potential of connectionist architectures in handling human language as a form of symbols.

Recent work has been exploring political biases and political reasoning capabilities in LLMs, mainly scoped in the US context. In light of the recent 2024 European Parliament elections, we are investigating if LLMs can be used as Voting Advice Applications (VAAs). We audit MISTRAL and MIXTRAL models and evaluate their accuracy in predicting the stance of political parties based on the latest "EU and I" voting assistance questionnaire. Furthermore, we explore alternatives to improve models' performance by augmenting the input context via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) relying on web search, and Self-Reflection using staged conversations that aim to re-collect relevant content from the model's internal memory. We find that MIXTRAL is highly accurate with an 82% accuracy on average. Augmenting the input context with expert-curated information can lead to a significant boost of approx. 9%, which remains an open challenge for automated approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Tells You Where to Merge: Adaptive KV Cache Merging for LLMs on Long-Context Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08454v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to efficiently serve Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a pressing issue because of their huge computational cost in their autoregressive generation process. To mitigate computational costs, LLMs often employ the KV Cache technique to improve the generation speed. While improving the computational efficiency, the storage requirements of the KV cache are substantial, particularly in long-context scenarios, leading to significant memory consumption. Existing KV cache eviction methods often degrade the performance of LLMs in long-context scenarios due to the information loss introduced by eviction. In this paper, we propose a novel KV cache merging approach, called KVMerger, to achieve adaptive KV cache compression for long-context tasks without significant performance degradation under constrained memory budgets. Our approach is inspired by the intriguing observation that key states exhibit high similarity at the token level within a single sequence. To facilitate merging, we develop an effective yet straightforward merging set identification algorithm to identify suitable KV states for merging. Our merging set identification algorithm stimulates the second observation that KV cache sparsity, from similarity perspective, is independent of the dataset and remains persistent at the model level. Subsequently, we propose a Gaussian kernel weighted merging algorithm to selectively merge all states within each merging set. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of KVMerger for long-context tasks under constrained memory budgets, applying it to models including Llama2-7B-chat and Llama2-13B-chat. Using the LongBench and ZeroScroll benchmarks, we compare our method with other KV cache compression techniques, including H2O and CaM, showing that our method achieves superior performance across tasks with both 50% and 35% KV cache budgets.</p></details> |  |

However, this expansion raises security concerns. In this study, we propose a three-layer concern framework to identify the potential security risks of LLM apps, i.e., LLM apps with abusive potential, LLM apps with malicious intent, and LLM apps with exploitable vulnerabilities. Over five months, we collected 786,036 LLM apps from six major app stores: GPT Store, FlowGPT, Poe, Coze, Cici, and Character.AI. Our research integrates static and dynamic analysis, the development of a large-scale toxic word dictionary (i.e., ToxicDict) comprising over 31,783 entries, and automated monitoring tools to identify and mitigate threats. We uncovered that 15,146 apps had misleading descriptions, 1,366 collected sensitive personal information against their privacy policies, and 15,996 generated harmful content such as hate speech, self-harm, extremism, etc. Additionally, we evaluated the potential for LLM apps to facilitate malicious activities, finding that 616 apps could be used for malware generation, phishing, etc. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks and enhanced enforcement mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

This work aims to shed light on the issue by evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs in a task of morphological analysis of complex Finnish noun forms. We generate the forms using an FST tool, and they are unlikely to have occurred in the training sets of the LLMs, therefore requiring morphological generalisation capacity. We find that GPT-4-turbo has some difficulties in the task while GPT-3.5-turbo struggles and smaller models Llama2-70B and Poro-34B fail nearly completely.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the CMCL Workshop at ACL 2024</p></details> |

Most research on network engineering automation has concentrated on configuration synthesis, often overlooking changes in the physical network topology. This paper introduces GeNet, a multimodal co-pilot for enterprise network engineers. GeNet is a novel framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) to streamline network design workflows. It uses visual and textual modalities to interpret and update network topologies and device configurations based on user intents. GeNet was evaluated on enterprise network scenarios adapted from Cisco certification exercises. Our results demonstrate GeNet's ability to interpret network topology images accurately, potentially reducing network engineers' efforts and accelerating network design processes in enterprise environments. Furthermore, we show the importance of precise topology understanding when handling intents that require modifications to the network's topology.</p></details> |  |

An active research area, digital phenotyping, involves collecting and analysing data from personal digital devices such as smartphones (usage and sensors) and wearables to infer behaviours and mental health. Whilst this data is standardly analysed using statistical and machine learning approaches, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a new approach to make sense of smartphone sensing data. Despite their effectiveness across various domains, LLMs remain relatively unexplored in digital mental health, particularly in integrating mobile sensor data. Our study aims to bridge this gap by employing LLMs to predict affect outcomes based on smartphone sensing data from university students. We demonstrate the efficacy of zero-shot and few-shot embedding LLMs in inferring general wellbeing. Our findings reveal that LLMs can make promising predictions of affect measures using solely smartphone sensing data. This research sheds light on the potential of LLMs for affective state prediction, emphasizing the intricate link between smartphone behavioral patterns and affective states. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage LLMs for affective state prediction and digital phenotyping tasks.</p></details> |  |

Radiologists often find chest X-rays insufficient for diagnosing underlying diseases, necessitating comprehensive clinical features and data integration. We present a novel technique to enhance the clinical context through augmentation techniques with clinical tabular data, thereby improving its applicability and reliability in AI medical diagnostics. To address this, we introduce a pioneering approach to clinical data augmentation that employs large language models (LLMs) to generate patient contextual synthetic data. This methodology is crucial for training more robust deep learning models in healthcare. It preserves the integrity of real patient data while enriching the dataset with contextually relevant synthetic features, significantly enhancing model performance. DALL-M uses a three-phase feature generation process: (i) clinical context storage, (ii) expert query generation, and (iii) context-aware feature augmentation. DALL-M generates new, clinically relevant features by synthesizing chest X-ray images and reports. Applied to 799 cases using nine features from the MIMIC-IV dataset, it created an augmented set of 91 features. This is the first work to generate contextual values for existing and new features based on patients' X-ray reports, gender, and age and to produce new contextual knowledge during data augmentation. Empirical validation with machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and TabNET, showed significant performance improvements. Incorporating augmented features increased the F1 score by 16.5% and Precision and Recall by approximately 25%. DALL-M addresses a critical gap in clinical data augmentation, offering a robust framework for generating contextually enriched datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>we in...</summary><p>we introduce a pioneering approach to clinical data augmentation that employs large language models (LLMs) to generate patient contextual synthetic data.

| **[Constructing Benchmarks and Interventions for Combating Hallucinations in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09971v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, which sparked a widespread effort to detect and prevent them. Recent work attempts to mitigate hallucinations by intervening in the model's generation, typically computing representative vectors of hallucinations vs. grounded generations, for steering the model's hidden states away from a hallucinatory state. However, common studies employ different setups and do not properly separate different possible causes of hallucinations, making interventions misguided. In this work, we introduce a method for categorizing examples based on the model's prior knowledge, named WACK. We construct WACK benchmarks that support interventions in two settings: open-book and closed-book question answering. Using the benchmarks, we perform an extensive investigation of the effect of different choices for intervention, such as the intervened components, and how often and how strongly to intervene. We find that intervention success varies depending on the component, with the attention blocks performing well and the residual stream proving detrimental to language modeling capabilities. We also show that interventions can benefit from representative vectors collected before, rather than after, a hallucination occurs. Finally, we introduce a new dynamic intervention, which intervenes only if needed, and thus is more robust than standard static interventions. The code is available at https://github.com/technion-cs-nlp/hallucination-mitigation .</p></details> |  |

This poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long input sequences during inference. In this work, we argue that LLMs themselves have inherent capabilities to handle long contexts without fine-tuning. To achieve this goal, we propose SelfExtend to extend the context window of LLMs by constructing bi-level attention information: the grouped attention and the neighbor attention. The grouped attention captures the dependencies among tokens that are far apart, while neighbor attention captures dependencies among adjacent tokens within a specified range. The two-level attentions are computed based on the original model's self-attention mechanism during inference. With minor code modification, our SelfExtend can effortlessly extend existing LLMs' context window without any fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and the results show that our SelfExtend can effectively extend existing LLMs' context window length.

| **[RATT: A Thought Structure for Coherent and Correct LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02746v3)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) gain substantial reasoning and decision-making capabilities from thought structures. However, existing methods such as Tree of Thought and Retrieval Augmented Thoughts often fall short in complex tasks due to the limitations of insufficient local retrieval of factual knowledge and inadequate global selection of strategies. These limitations make it challenging for these methods to balance factual accuracy and comprehensive logical optimization effectively. To address these limitations, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Thought Tree (RATT), a novel thought structure that considers both overall logical soundness and factual correctness at each step of the thinking process. Specifically, at every point of a thought branch, RATT performs planning and lookahead to explore and evaluate multiple potential reasoning steps, and integrate the fact-checking ability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLM's ability to assess overall strategy. Through this combination of factual knowledge and strategic feasibility, the RATT adjusts and integrates the thought tree structure to search for the most promising branches within the search space. This thought structure significantly enhances the model's coherence in logical inference and efficiency in decision-making, and thus increases the limit of the capacity of LLM to generate reliable inferences and decisions based on thought structures. A broad range of experiments on different types of tasks showcases that the RATT structure significantly outperforms existing methods in factual correctness and logical coherence.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates LLMs application in the biomedical domain by exploring strategies to enhance their performance for the NER task. Our study reveals the importance of meticulously designed prompts in the biomedical. Strategic selection of in-context examples yields a marked improvement, offering ~15-20\% increase in F1 score across all benchmark datasets for biomedical few-shot NER. Additionally, our results indicate that integrating external biomedical knowledge via prompting strategies can enhance the proficiency of general-purpose LLMs to meet the specialized needs of biomedical NER. Leveraging a medical knowledge base, our proposed method, DiRAG, inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can boost the zero-shot F1 score of LLMs for biomedical NER.

| **[A Closer Look at Logical Reasoning with LLMs: The Choice of Tool Matters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00284v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated promising progress in solving logical reasoning tasks effectively. Several recent approaches have proposed to change the role of the LLM from the reasoner into a translator between natural language statements and symbolic representations which are then sent to external symbolic solvers to resolve. This paradigm has established the current state-of-the-art result in logical reasoning (i.e., deductive reasoning). However, it remains unclear whether the variance in performance of these approaches stems from the methodologies employed or the specific symbolic solvers utilized. There is a lack of consistent comparison between symbolic solvers and how they influence the overall reported performance. This is important, as each symbolic solver also has its own input symbolic language, presenting varying degrees of challenge in the translation process. To address this gap, we perform experiments on 3 deductive reasoning benchmarks with LLMs augmented with widely used symbolic solvers: Z3, Pyke, and Prover9. The tool-executable rates of symbolic translation generated by different LLMs exhibit a near 50% performance variation. This highlights a significant difference in performance rooted in very basic choices of tools. The almost linear correlation between the executable rate of translations and the accuracy of the outcomes from Prover9 highlight a strong alignment between LLMs ability to translate into Prover9 symbolic language, and the correctness of those translations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/Mattylam/Logic_Symbolic_Solvers_Experiment</p></details> |

The open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, allows LLMs to compete and generates detailed data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formats for leaderboard rankings and further analysis. We present the results of games among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta. We also encourage submissions of results from other LLMs. In total, we simulated 2,310 matches (5 sessions for each pair among 7 LLMs and a random player) across three types of games, using three distinct prompt types: list, illustration, and image. The results revealed significant variations in LLM performance across different games and prompt types, with analysis covering win and disqualification rates, missed opportunity analysis, and invalid move analysis. The details of the leaderboard and result matrix data are available as open-access data on GitHub. This study enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in playing games they were not specifically trained for, helping to assess their rule comprehension and strategic thinking. On the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this study lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complex decision-making scenarios, illuminating their strategic thinking abilities and offering directions for further inquiry into the limits of LLMs within game-based frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Explainers: Harnessing LLMs for Explaining Black Box Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05797v4)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in complex tasks like machine translation, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding. One of the primary reasons for the adaptability of LLMs in such diverse tasks is their in-context learning (ICL) capability, which allows them to perform well on new tasks by simply using a few task samples in the prompt. Despite their effectiveness in enhancing the performance of LLMs on diverse language and tabular tasks, these methods have not been thoroughly explored for their potential to generate post hoc explanations. In this work, we carry out one of the first explorations to analyze the effectiveness of LLMs in explaining other complex predictive models using ICL. To this end, we propose a novel framework, In-Context Explainers, comprising of three novel approaches that exploit the ICL capabilities of LLMs to explain the predictions made by other predictive models. We conduct extensive analysis with these approaches on real-world tabular and text datasets and demonstrate that LLMs are capable of explaining other predictive models similar to state-of-the-art post hoc explainers, opening up promising avenues for future research into LLM-based post hoc explanations of complex predictive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy Law: The Story Behind Data Compression and LLM Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06645v3)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data is the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs), but not all data is useful for model learning. Carefully selected data can better elicit the capabilities of LLMs with much less computational overhead. Most methods concentrate on evaluating the quality of individual samples in data selection, while the combinatorial effects among samples are neglected. Even if each sample is of perfect quality, their combinations may be suboptimal in teaching LLMs due to their intrinsic homogeneity or contradiction. In this paper, we aim to uncover the underlying relationships between LLM performance and data selection. Inspired by the information compression nature of LLMs, we uncover an ``entropy law'' that connects LLM performance with data compression ratio and first-epoch training loss, which reflect the information redundancy of a dataset and the mastery of inherent knowledge encoded in this dataset, respectively. Through both theoretical deduction and empirical evaluation, we find that model performance is negatively correlated to the compression ratio of training data, which usually yields a lower training loss. Based on the findings of the entropy law, we propose a quite efficient and universal data selection method named \textbf{ZIP} for training LLMs, which aim to prioritize data subsets exhibiting a low compression ratio. Based on a multi-stage algorithm that selects diverse data in a greedy manner, we can obtain a good data subset with satisfactory diversity. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the entropy law and the superiority of ZIP across different LLM backbones and alignment stages. We also present an interesting application of entropy law that can detect potential performance risks at the beginning of model training.</p></details> |  |

With the growing ability for modern large language models (LLMs) to role-play, one can apply LLMs as Wizards in WoZ experiments with better scalability and lower cost than the traditional approach. However, methodological guidance on responsibly applying LLMs in WoZ experiments and a systematic evaluation of LLMs' role-playing ability are lacking. Through two LLM-powered WoZ studies, we take the first step towards identifying an experiment lifecycle for researchers to safely integrate LLMs into WoZ experiments and interpret data generated from settings that involve Wizards role-played by LLMs. We also contribute a heuristic-based evaluation framework that allows the estimation of LLMs' role-playing ability in WoZ experiments and reveals LLMs' behavior patterns at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ACM IVA 2024</p></details> |

Such momentum towards local deployment means the use of compressed LLMs will widely impact a large population. However, prior analysis works often prioritize on preserving perplexity which is a direct analogy to training loss. The impact of compression method on other critical aspects of model behavior, particularly safety, still calls for a systematic assessment. To this end, we investigate the impact of model compression on four dimensions: (1) degeneration harm, i.e., bias and toxicity in generation; (2) representational harm, i.e., biases in discriminative tasks; (3) dialect bias; (4) language modeling and downstream task performance. We cover a wide spectrum of LLM compression techniques, including unstructured pruning, semi-structured pruning and quantization. Our analysis reveals that compression can lead to unexpected consequences. Although compression may unintentionally remedy LLMs' degeneration harm, it can still exacerbate on the representational harm axis. Although compression may unintentionally remedy LLMs' degeneration harm, it can still exacerbate on the representational harm axis. Moreover, there is a divergent impact on different protected groups as the compression rate grows. Finally, different compression methods have drastically different safety impacts, e.g., quantization mostly preserves bias while pruning degrades quickly. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating safety assessments into the development of compressed LLMs to ensure their reliability across real-world applications.

Recently, weight-only quantization techniques have also been applied to LoRA methods to reduce the memory footprint of fine-tuning. However, applying weight-activation quantization to the LoRA pipeline is under-explored, and we observe substantial performance degradation primarily due to the presence of activation outliers. In this work, we propose RoLoRA, the first LoRA-based scheme for effective weight-activation quantization. RoLoRA utilizes rotation for outlier elimination and proposes rotation-aware fine-tuning to preserve the outlier-free characteristics in rotated LLMs. Experimental results show RoLoRA consistently improves low-bit LoRA convergence and post-training quantization robustness in weight-activation settings. We evaluate RoLoRA across LLaMA2-7B/13B, LLaMA3-8B models, achieving up to 29.5% absolute accuracy gain of 4-bit weight-activation quantized LLaMA2- 13B on commonsense reasoning tasks compared to LoRA baseline. We further demonstrate its effectiveness on Large Multimodal Models (LLaVA-1.5-7B). Codes are available at https://github.com/HuangOwen/RoLoRA</p></details> |  |

| **[In-Loop Filtering via Trained Look-Up Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10926v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology for removing the artifacts in image/video coding standards. Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

This intends to handle two pivotal challenges in the existing CIR methods: (i) lacking adaptability and universality for different image codecs, e.g., JPEG and WebP; (ii) poor texture generation capability, particularly at low bitrates. Specifically, our MoE-DiffIR develops the powerful mixture-of-experts (MoE) prompt module, where some basic prompts cooperate to excavate the task-customized diffusion priors from Stable Diffusion (SD) for each compression task. Moreover, the degradation-aware routing mechanism is proposed to enable the flexible assignment of basic prompts. To activate and reuse the cross-modality generation prior of SD, we design the visual-to-text adapter for MoE-DiffIR, which aims to adapt the embedding of low-quality images from the visual domain to the textual domain as the textual guidance for SD, enabling more consistent and reasonable texture generation. We also construct one comprehensive benchmark dataset for universal CIR, covering 21 types of degradations from 7 popular traditional and learned codecs. Extensive experiments on universal CIR have demonstrated the excellent robustness and texture restoration capability of our proposed MoE-DiffIR.

Among them, the blind spot network based methods are the most typical type and have attracted the attentions of a large number of researchers. Although the introduction of blind spot operations can prevent identity mapping from noise to noise, it imposes stringent requirements on the receptive fields in the network design, thereby limiting overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a single mask scheme for self-supervised denoising training, which eliminates the need for blind spot operation and thereby removes constraints on the network structure design. Furthermore, to achieve denoising across entire image during inference, we propose a multi-mask scheme. Our method, featuring the asymmetric mask scheme in training and inference, achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing real noisy image datasets. All the source code will be made available to the public.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restoring Images in Adverse Weather Conditions via Histogram Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10172v1)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based image restoration methods in adverse weather have achieved significant progress. Most of them use self-attention along the channel dimension or within spatially fixed-range blocks to reduce computational load. However, such a compromise results in limitations in capturing long-range spatial features. Inspired by the observation that the weather-induced degradation factors mainly cause similar occlusion and brightness, in this work, we propose an efficient Histogram Transformer (Histoformer) for restoring images affected by adverse weather. It is powered by a mechanism dubbed histogram self-attention, which sorts and segments spatial features into intensity-based bins. Self-attention is then applied across bins or within each bin to selectively focus on spatial features of dynamic range and process similar degraded pixels of the long range together. To boost histogram self-attention, we present a dynamic-range convolution enabling conventional convolution to conduct operation over similar pixels rather than neighbor pixels. We also observe that the common pixel-wise losses neglect linear association and correlation between output and ground-truth. Thus, we propose to leverage the Pearson correlation coefficient as a loss function to enforce the recovered pixels following the identical order as ground-truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our proposed method. We have released the codes in Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 10MB</p></details> |
| **[Improving Feature Stability during Upsampling -- Spectral Artifacts and the Importance of Spatial Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17524v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixel-wise predictions are required in a wide variety of tasks such as image restoration, image segmentation, or disparity estimation. Common models involve several stages of data resampling, in which the resolution of feature maps is first reduced to aggregate information and then increased to generate a high-resolution output. Previous works have shown that resampling operations are subject to artifacts such as aliasing. During downsampling, aliases have been shown to compromise the prediction stability of image classifiers. During upsampling, they have been leveraged to detect generated content. Yet, the effect of aliases during upsampling has not yet been discussed w.r.t. the stability and robustness of pixel-wise predictions. While falling under the same term (aliasing), the challenges for correct upsampling in neural networks differ significantly from those during downsampling: when downsampling, some high frequencies can not be correctly represented and have to be removed to avoid aliases. However, when upsampling for pixel-wise predictions, we actually require the model to restore such high frequencies that can not be encoded in lower resolutions. The application of findings from signal processing is therefore a necessary but not a sufficient condition to achieve the desirable output. In contrast, we find that the availability of large spatial context during upsampling allows to provide stable, high-quality pixel-wise predictions, even when fully learning all filter weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Motion-Guided Latent Diffusion for Temporally Consistent Real-world Video Super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00853v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world low-resolution (LR) videos have diverse and complex degradations, imposing great challenges on video super-resolution (VSR) algorithms to reproduce their high-resolution (HR) counterparts with high quality. Recently, the diffusion models have shown compelling performance in generating realistic details for image restoration tasks. However, the diffusion process has randomness, making it hard to control the contents of restored images. This issue becomes more serious when applying diffusion models to VSR tasks because temporal consistency is crucial to the perceptual quality of videos. In this paper, we propose an effective real-world VSR algorithm by leveraging the strength of pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure the content consistency among adjacent frames, we exploit the temporal dynamics in LR videos to guide the diffusion process by optimizing the latent sampling path with a motion-guided loss, ensuring that the generated HR video maintains a coherent and continuous visual flow. To further mitigate the discontinuity of generated details, we insert temporal module to the decoder and fine-tune it with an innovative sequence-oriented loss. The proposed motion-guided latent diffusion (MGLD) based VSR algorithm achieves significantly better perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Region Attention Transformer for Medical Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09268v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in medical image restoration, attributed to the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism in the spatial dimension. However, the majority of existing Transformers conduct attention within fixed and coarsely partitioned regions (\text{e.g.} the entire image or fixed patches), resulting in interference from irrelevant regions and fragmentation of continuous image content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Region Attention Transformer (RAT) that utilizes a region-based multi-head self-attention mechanism (R-MSA). The R-MSA dynamically partitions the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions using the robust Segment Anything Model (SAM) and then performs self-attention within these regions. This region partitioning is more flexible and interpretable, ensuring that only pixels from similar semantic regions complement each other, thereby eliminating interference from irrelevant regions. Moreover, we introduce a focal region loss to guide our model to adaptively focus on recovering high-difficulty regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RAT in various medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, and pathological image super-resolution.

However, most existing restoration approaches are limited in their applicability to specific weather conditions in training data and struggle to generalize to unseen weather types, including real-world weather conditions. To address this issue, we introduce MetaWeather, a universal approach that can handle diverse and novel weather conditions with a single unified model. Extending a powerful meta-learning framework, MetaWeather formulates the task of weather-degraded image restoration as a few-shot adaptation problem that predicts the degradation pattern of a query image, and learns to adapt to unseen weather conditions through a novel spatial-channel matching algorithm. Experimental results on the BID Task II.A, SPA-Data, and RealSnow datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can adapt to unseen weather conditions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-weather image restoration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

Many existing methods primarily focus on the spatial domain, neglecting the understanding of frequency variations and ignoring the impact of implicit noise in skip connections. In this paper, we introduce a multi-scale frequency selection network (MSFSNet) that seamlessly integrates spatial and frequency domain knowledge, selectively recovering richer and more accurate information. Specifically, we initially capture spatial features and input them into dynamic filter selection modules (DFS) at different scales to integrate frequency knowledge. DFS utilizes learnable filters to generate high and low-frequency information and employs a frequency cross-attention mechanism (FCAM) to determine the most information to recover. To learn a multi-scale and accurate set of hybrid features, we develop a skip feature fusion block (SFF) that leverages contextual features to discriminatively determine which information should be propagated in skip-connections. It is worth noting that our DFS and SFF are generic plug-in modules that can be directly employed in existing networks without any adjustments, leading to performance improvements. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that our MSFSNet achieves performance that is either superior or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.20106</p></details> |

Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking. In this paper, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from technical details to applications. We highlight the major advancements in deep learning-based single-image shadow removal methods, thoroughly review previous research across various categories, and provide insights into the historical progression of these developments. Additionally, we summarize performance comparisons both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond the technical aspects of shadow removal methods, we also explore potential future directions for this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>url: ...</summary><p>url: https://github.com/GuoLanqing/Awesome-Shadow-Removal</p></details> |

To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, based on our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method, known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants.

Nevertheless, this solution poses several key challenges: i) increasing the carrier frequency and bandwidth leads to greater channel frequency selectivity in time and frequency domains, and ii) the greater the number of antennas the greater the the pilot overhead for channel estimation and the more prohibitively complex it becomes to determine the optimal precoding matrix. This paper presents two deep-learning frameworks to solve these issues. Firstly, we propose a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that is based on image super-resolution and captures the correlations between the transmitting and receiving antennas and the frequency domains to combat frequency selectivity. Secondly, we devise a deep learning-based framework to combat the time selectivity of the channel that treats channel aging as a distortion that can be mitigated through deep learning-based image restoration techniques. Simulation results show that combining both frameworks leads to a significant improvement in performance compared to existing techniques with little increase in complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In particular, the pre-trained text-to-image stable diffusion models provide a potential solution to the challenging realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) and image stylization problems with their strong generative priors. However, the existing methods along this line often fail to keep faithful pixel-wise image structures. If extra skip connections between the encoder and the decoder of a VAE are used to reproduce details, additional training in image space will be required, limiting the application to tasks in latent space such as image stylization. In this work, we propose a pixel-aware stable diffusion (PASD) network to achieve robust Real-ISR and personalized image stylization. Specifically, a pixel-aware cross attention module is introduced to enable diffusion models perceiving image local structures in pixel-wise level, while a degradation removal module is used to extract degradation insensitive features to guide the diffusion process together with image high level information. An adjustable noise schedule is introduced to further improve the image restoration results. By simply replacing the base diffusion model with a stylized one, PASD can generate diverse stylized images without collecting pairwise training data, and by shifting the base model with an aesthetic one, PASD can bring old photos back to life. Extensive experiments in a variety of image enhancement and stylization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PASD approach.

In this research, we introduce a multi-scale generative model that enhances conditional image restoration through a novel exploitation of the Brownian Bridge process within wavelet domain. By initiating the Brownian Bridge diffusion process specifically at the lowest-frequency subband and applying generative adversarial networks at subsequent multi-scale high-frequency subbands in the wavelet domain, our method provides significant acceleration during training and sampling while sustaining a high image generation quality and diversity on par with SOTA diffusion models. Experimental results on various computational microscopy and imaging tasks confirm our method's robust performance and its considerable reduction in its sampling steps and time. This pioneering technique offers an efficient image restoration framework that harmonizes efficiency with quality, signifying a major stride in incorporating cutting-edge generative models into computational microscopy workflows.</p></details> |  |

Adversarial attacks such as the seminal projected gradient descent (PGD) offer an effective means to evaluate a model's robustness and dedicated solutions have been proposed for attacks on semantic segmentation or optical flow estimation. While they attempt to increase the attack's efficiency, a further objective is to balance its effect, so that it acts on the entire image domain instead of isolated point-wise predictions. This often comes at the cost of optimization stability and thus efficiency. Here, we propose CosPGD, an attack that encourages more balanced errors over the entire image domain while increasing the attack's overall efficiency. To this end, CosPGD leverages a simple alignment score computed from any pixel-wise prediction and its target to scale the loss in a smooth and fully differentiable way. It leads to efficient evaluations of a model's robustness for semantic segmentation as well as regression models (such as optical flow, disparity estimation, or image restoration), and it allows it to outperform the previous SotA attack on semantic segmentation. We provide code for the CosPGD algorithm and example usage at https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/cospgd.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2024</p></details> |

Moreover, existing methods often suffer from over-smoothing and lack of realism in the restored results. To address these issues, we propose Diff-Restorer, a universal image restoration method based on the diffusion model, aiming to leverage the prior knowledge of Stable Diffusion to remove degradation while generating high perceptual quality restoration results. Specifically, we utilize the pre-trained visual language model to extract visual prompts from degraded images, including semantic and degradation embeddings. The semantic embeddings serve as content prompts to guide the diffusion model for generation. In contrast, the degradation embeddings modulate the Image-guided Control Module to generate spatial priors for controlling the spatial structure of the diffusion process, ensuring faithfulness to the original image. Additionally, we design a Degradation-aware Decoder to perform structural correction and convert the latent code to the pixel domain. We conducted comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis on restoration tasks with different degradations, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of the generated images is still a significant challenge due to the severity of image degradation and the uncontrollability of the diffusion model. In this work, we delve into the potential of utilizing pre-trained stable diffusion for image restoration and propose MRIR, a diffusion-based restoration method with multimodal insights. Specifically, we explore the problem from two perspectives: textual level and visual level. For the textual level, we harness the power of the pre-trained multimodal large language model to infer meaningful semantic information from low-quality images. Furthermore, we employ the CLIP image encoder with a designed Refine Layer to capture image details as a supplement. For the visual level, we mainly focus on the pixel level control. Thus, we utilize a Pixel-level Processor and ControlNet to control spatial structures. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned control information into the denoising U-Net using multi-level attention mechanisms and realize controllable image restoration with multimodal insights. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate our method's superiority over other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on a pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the self-attention layer with the proposed cross-previous-frame attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between neighboring frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy for better temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in producing temporally consistent videos with better fidelity.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems. For example, we achieve a PSNR of 30.72dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for phase retrieval, which is an improvement of 9.12dB compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

| **[Blind Inversion using Latent Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01027v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for solving inverse problems due to their exceptional ability to model complex prior distributions. However, existing methods predominantly assume known forward operators (i.e., non-blind), limiting their applicability in practical settings where acquiring such operators is costly. Additionally, many current approaches rely on pixel-space diffusion models, leaving the potential of more powerful latent diffusion models (LDMs) underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LatentDEM, an innovative technique that addresses more challenging blind inverse problems using latent diffusion priors. At the core of our method is solving blind inverse problems within an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework: (1) the E-step recovers clean images from corrupted observations using LDM priors and a known forward model, and (2) the M-step estimates the forward operator based on the recovered images. Additionally, we propose two novel optimization techniques tailored for LDM priors and EM frameworks, yielding more accurate and efficient blind inversion results. As a general framework, LatentDEM supports both linear and non-linear inverse problems. Beyond common 2D image restoration tasks, it enables new capabilities in non-linear 3D inverse rendering problems. We validate LatentDEM's performance on representative 2D blind deblurring and 3D sparse-view reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its superior efficacy over prior arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Frequency-Aware Dynamic Transformers for All-In-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01636v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to tackle the all-in-one image restoration task, which seeks to handle multiple types of degradation with a single model. The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Recognizing that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new all-in-one image restoration approach from a frequency perspective, leveraging advanced vision transformers. Our method consists of two main components: a frequency-aware Degradation prior learning transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing inputs into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods on four representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing and deblurring. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling spatially variant degradations and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. Rather than popular feature adaptation methods, we propose weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we figure out task-sensitive weights via a toy experiment and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs.

In this paper, we focus on the task of all-in-one medical image restoration, aiming to address multiple distinct MedIR tasks with a single universal model. Nonetheless, due to significant differences between different MedIR tasks, training a universal model often encounters task interference issues, where different tasks with shared parameters may conflict with each other in the gradient update direction. This task interference leads to deviation of the model update direction from the optimal path, thereby affecting the model's performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a task-adaptive routing strategy, allowing conflicting tasks to select different network paths in spatial and channel dimensions, thereby mitigating task interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed \textbf{A}ll-in-one \textbf{M}edical \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration (\textbf{AMIR}) network achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis, both in single-task and all-in-one settings.

| **[Using diffusion model as constraint: Empower Image Restoration Network Training with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19030v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration has made marvelous progress with the advent of deep learning. Previous methods usually rely on designing powerful network architecture to elevate performance, however, the natural visual effect of the restored results is limited by color and texture distortions. Besides the visual perceptual quality, the semantic perception recovery is an important but often overlooked perspective of restored image, which is crucial for the deployment in high-level tasks. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to resort these issues by introducing a naturalness-oriented and semantic-aware optimization mechanism, dubbed DiffLoss. Specifically, inspired by the powerful distribution coverage capability of the diffusion model for natural image generation, we exploit the Markov chain sampling property of diffusion model and project the restored results of existing networks into the sampling space. Besides, we reveal that the bottleneck feature of diffusion models, also dubbed h-space feature, is a natural high-level semantic space. We delve into this property and propose a semantic-aware loss to further unlock its potential of semantic perception recovery, which paves the way to connect image restoration task and downstream high-level recognition task. With these two strategies, the DiffLoss can endow existing restoration methods with both more natural and semantic-aware results. We verify the effectiveness of our method on substantial common image restoration tasks and benchmarks. Code will be available at https://github.com/JosephTiTan/DiffLoss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denoising as Adaptation: Noise-Space Domain Adaptation for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18516v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although deep learning-based image restoration methods have made significant progress, they still struggle with limited generalization to real-world scenarios due to the substantial domain gap caused by training on synthetic data. Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise-space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how the multi-step denoising process is influenced by auxiliary conditional inputs, we obtain meaningful gradients from noise prediction to gradually align the restored results of both synthetic and real-world data to a common clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during training, we present useful techniques such as channel shuffling and residual-swapping contrastive learning. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The joint training process of IRConStyle, an Image Restoration framework consisting of ConStyle and a general restoration network, is divided into two stages: first, pre-training ConStyle alone, and then freezing its weights to guide the training of the general restoration network. Three improvements are proposed in the pre-training stage to train ConStyle: unsupervised pre-training, adding a pretext task (i.e. classification), and adopting knowledge distillation. Without bells and whistles, we can get ConStyle v2, a strong prompter for all-in-one Image Restoration, in less than two GPU days and doesn't require any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on Restormer (transformer-based), NAFNet (CNN-based), MAXIM-1S (MLP-based), and a vanilla CNN network demonstrate that ConStyle v2 can enhance any U-Net style Image Restoration models to all-in-one Image Restoration models. Furthermore, models guided by the well-trained ConStyle v2 exhibit superior performance in some specific degradation compared to ConStyle.</p></details> |  |
| **[MFDNet: Multi-Frequency Deflare Network for Efficient Nighttime Flare Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18079v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When light is scattered or reflected accidentally in the lens, flare artifacts may appear in the captured photos, affecting the photos' visual quality. The main challenge in flare removal is to eliminate various flare artifacts while preserving the original content of the image. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight Multi-Frequency Deflare Network (MFDNet) based on the Laplacian Pyramid. Our network decomposes the flare-corrupted image into low and high-frequency bands, effectively separating the illumination and content information in the image. The low-frequency part typically contains illumination information, while the high-frequency part contains detailed content information. So our MFDNet consists of two main modules: the Low-Frequency Flare Perception Module (LFFPM) to remove flare in the low-frequency part and the Hierarchical Fusion Reconstruction Module (HFRM) to reconstruct the flare-free image. Specifically, to perceive flare from a global perspective while retaining detailed information for image restoration, LFFPM utilizes Transformer to extract global information while utilizing a convolutional neural network to capture detailed local features. Then HFRM gradually fuses the outputs of LFFPM with the high-frequency component of the image through feature aggregation. Moreover, our MFDNet can reduce the computational cost by processing in multiple frequency bands instead of directly removing the flare on the input image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in removing nighttime flare on real-world and synthetic images from the Flare7K dataset. Furthermore, the computational complexity of our model is remarkably low.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Visual Computer journal</p></details> |
| **[Graph Image Prior for Unsupervised Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15770v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can be a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> |  |
| **[DaLPSR: Leverage Degradation-Aligned Language Prompt for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16477v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level, especially in real-world cases based on reference-free metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIR: A Lightweight Baseline for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01368v3)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been significant advancements in Image Restoration based on CNN and transformer. However, the inherent characteristics of the Image Restoration task are often overlooked in many works. They, instead, tend to focus on the basic block design and stack numerous such blocks to the model, leading to parameters redundant and computations unnecessary. Thus, the efficiency of the image restoration is hindered. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Baseline network for Image Restoration called LIR to efficiently restore the image and remove degradations. First of all, through an ingenious structural design, LIR removes the degradations existing in the local and global residual connections that are ignored by modern networks. Then, a Lightweight Adaptive Attention (LAA) Block is introduced which is mainly composed of proposed Adaptive Filters and Attention Blocks. The proposed Adaptive Filter is used to adaptively extract high-frequency information and enhance object contours in various IR tasks, and Attention Block involves a novel Patch Attention module to approximate the self-attention part of the transformer. On the deraining task, our LIR achieves the state-of-the-art Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). For denoising, dehazing, and deblurring tasks, LIR also achieves a comparable performance to state-of-the-art models with a parameter size of about 30\%. In addition, it is worth noting that our LIR produces better visual results that are more in line with the human aesthetic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultra-High-Definition Restoration: New Benchmarks and A Dual Interaction Prior-Driven Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13607v2)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration has acquired remarkable attention due to its practical demand. In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, UHD image desonwing, and UHD image deraining.

| **[Image Restoration Using Deep Regulated Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08853v2)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the depth of convolutional neural networks has attracted substantial attention in the deep learning research, the width of these networks has recently received greater interest. The width of networks, defined as the size of the receptive fields and the density of the channels, has demonstrated crucial importance in low-level vision tasks such as image denoising and restoration. However, the limited generalization ability, due to the increased width of networks, creates a bottleneck in designing wider networks. In this paper, we propose the Deep Regulated Convolutional Network (RC-Net), a deep network composed of regulated sub-network blocks cascaded by skip-connections, to overcome this bottleneck. Specifically, the Regulated Convolution block (RC-block), featured by a combination of large and small convolution filters, balances the effectiveness of prominent feature extraction and the generalization ability of the network. RC-Nets have several compelling advantages: they embrace diversified features through large-small filter combinations, alleviate the hazy boundary and blurred details in image denoising and super-resolution problems, and stabilize the learning process. Our proposed RC-Nets outperform state-of-the-art approaches with significant performance gains in various image restoration tasks while demonstrating promising generalization ability.

However, these methods often struggle with overfitting and lack interpretability. In this paper, we explore an alternative clustering approach based on deep unfolding. By unfolding iterative optimization methods into neural networks, this approach offers enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to data-driven deep learning methods, and greater adaptability and generalization than model-based approaches. Hence, unfolding has become widely used in inverse imaging problems, such as image restoration, reconstruction, and super-resolution, but has not been sufficiently explored yet in the context of clustering. In this work, we introduce an innovative clustering architecture for hyperspectral images (HSI) by unfolding an iterative solver based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for sparse subspace clustering. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply unfolding ADMM for computing the self-representation matrix in subspace clustering. Moreover, our approach captures well the structural characteristics of HSI data by employing the K nearest neighbors algorithm as part of a structure preservation module. Experimental evaluation of three established HSI datasets shows clearly the potential of the unfolding approach in HSI clustering and even demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based framework called GridFormer which serves as a backbone for image restoration under adverse weather conditions. GridFormer is designed in a grid structure using a residual dense transformer block, and it introduces two core designs. First, it uses an enhanced attention mechanism in the transformer layer. The mechanism includes stages of the sampler and compact self-attention to improve efficiency, and a local enhancement stage to strengthen local information. Second, we introduce a residual dense transformer block (RDTB) as the final GridFormer layer. This design further improves the network's ability to learn effective features from both preceding and current local features. The GridFormer framework achieves state-of-the-art results on five diverse image restoration tasks in adverse weather conditions, including image deraining, dehazing, deraining \& dehazing, desnowing, and multi-weather restoration.

| **[Diffusion Model-based FOD Restoration from High Distortion in dMRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13209v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fiber orientation distributions (FODs) is a popular model to represent the diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. However, imaging artifacts such as susceptibility-induced distortion in dMRI can cause signal loss and lead to the corrupted reconstruction of FODs, which prohibits successful fiber tracking and connectivity analysis in affected brain regions such as the brain stem. Generative models, such as the diffusion models, have been successfully applied in various image restoration tasks. However, their application on FOD images poses unique challenges since FODs are 4-dimensional data represented by spherical harmonics (SPHARM) with the 4-th dimension exhibiting order-related dependency. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model for FOD restoration that can recover the signal loss caused by distortion artifacts. We use volume-order encoding to enhance the ability of the diffusion model to generate individual FOD volumes at all SPHARM orders. Moreover, we add cross-attention features extracted across all SPHARM orders in generating every individual FOD volume to capture the order-related dependency across FOD volumes. We also condition the diffusion model with low-distortion FODs surrounding high-distortion areas to maintain the geometric coherence of the generated FODs. We trained and tested our model using data from the UK Biobank (n = 1315). On a test set with ground truth (n = 43), we demonstrate the high accuracy of the generated FODs in terms of root mean square errors of FOD volumes and angular errors of FOD peaks. We also apply our method to a test set with large distortion in the brain stem area (n = 1172) and demonstrate the efficacy of our method in restoring the FOD integrity and, hence, greatly improving tractography performance in affected brain regions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Restorer: Solving Multiple Image Restoration Tasks with One Set of Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12587v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although there are many excellent solutions in image restoration, the fact that they are specifically designed for a single image restoration task may prevent them from being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in other types of image restoration tasks. While some approaches require considering multiple image restoration tasks, they are still not sufficient for the requirements of the real world and may suffer from the task confusion issue. In this work, we focus on designing a unified and effective solution for multiple image restoration tasks including deraining, desnowing, defogging, deblurring, denoising, and low-light enhancement. Based on the above purpose, we propose a Transformer network Restorer with U-Net architecture. In order to effectively deal with degraded information in multiple image restoration tasks, we need a more comprehensive attention mechanism. Thus, we design all-axis attention (AAA) through stereo embedding and 3D convolution, which can simultaneously model the long-range dependencies in both spatial and channel dimensions, capturing potential correlations among all axis. Moreover, we propose a Restorer based on textual prompts. Compared to previous methods that employ learnable queries, textual prompts bring explicit task priors to solve the task confusion issue arising from learnable queries and introduce interactivity. Based on these designs, Restorer demonstrates SOTA or comparable performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to universal image restoration frameworks and methods specifically designed for these individual tasks. Meanwhile, Restorer is faster during inference. The above results along with the real-world test results show that Restorer has the potential to serve as a backbone for multiple real-world image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real- ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real- ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source codes will be released at https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel transformer-based method for GFIQA, which is aided by two unique mechanisms. First, a Dual-Set Degradation Representation Learning (DSL) mechanism uses facial images with both synthetic and real degradations to decouple degradation from content, ensuring generalizability to real-world scenarios. This self-supervised method learns degradation features on a global scale, providing a robust alternative to conventional methods that use local patch information in degradation learning. Second, our transformer leverages facial landmarks to emphasize visually salient parts of a face image in evaluating its perceptual quality. We also introduce a balanced and diverse Comprehensive Generic Face IQA (CGFIQA-40k) dataset of 40K images carefully designed to overcome the biases, in particular the imbalances in skin tone and gender representation, in existing datasets. Extensive analysis and evaluation demonstrate the robustness of our method, marking a significant improvement over prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024, Project Page: https://dsl-fiqa.github.io/</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a Meta-learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based SISR approach to learn kernel priors from organized randomness. In concrete, a lightweight network is adopted as kernel generator, and is optimized via learning from the MCMC simulation on random Gaussian distributions. This procedure provides an approximation for the rational blur kernel, and introduces a network-level Langevin dynamics into SISR optimization processes, which contributes to preventing bad local optimal solutions for kernel estimation. Meanwhile, a meta-learning-based alternating optimization procedure is proposed to optimize the kernel generator and image restorer, respectively. In contrast to the conventional alternating minimization strategy, a meta-learning-based framework is applied to learn an adaptive optimization strategy, which is less-greedy and results in better convergence performance. These two procedures are iteratively processed in a plug-and-play fashion, for the first time, realizing a learning-based but plug-and-play blind SISR solution in unsupervised inference. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance and generalization ability of the proposed approach when comparing with state-of-the-arts on synthesis and real-world datasets.

We propose LayeredDoc, which utilizes two layers of information: the first targets coarse-grained graphic components, while the second refines machine-printed textual content. This hierarchical DIR framework dynamically adjusts to the characteristics of the input document, facilitating effective domain adaptation. We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively using a new real-world dataset, LayeredDocDB, developed for this study.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate the versatility of DDR as an image descriptor, with strong correlations observed with key image attributes such as complexity, colorfulness, sharpness, and overall quality. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of DDR across a spectrum of applications. It excels as a blind image quality assessment metric, outperforming existing methodologies across multiple datasets. Additionally, DDR serves as an effective unsupervised learning objective in image restoration tasks, yielding notable advancements in image deblurring and single-image super-resolution.

Improvement in Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) reconstruction has been achieved by integrating Swin Image Restoration (SwinIR) based sinogram and image enhancement modules. The proposed methodology uses Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent (NAG) to solve the least squares (NAG-LS) problem in CT image reconstruction. The integration of sinogram and image enhancement modules aims to enhance image clarity and preserve fine details, offering a promising solution for both low dose and clinical dose CBCT reconstruction. The averaged mean squared error (MSE) over the validation dataset has decreased significantly, in the case of low dose by one-fifth and clinical dose by one-tenth.

Despite its potential, the lack of Image signal processing (ISP) pipeline specifically designed for HybridEVS poses a significant challenge. To address this challenge, in this study, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework named DemosaicFormer which comprises coarse demosaicing and pixel correction. Coarse demosaicing network is designed to produce a preliminary high-quality estimate of the RGB image from the HybridEVS raw data while the pixel correction network enhances the performance of image restoration and mitigates the impact of defective pixels. Our key innovation is the design of a Multi-Scale Gating Module (MSGM) applying the integration of cross-scale features, which allows feature information to flow between different scales. Additionally, the adoption of progressive training and data augmentation strategies further improves model's robustness and effectiveness. Experimental results show superior performance against the existing methods both qualitatively and visually, and our DemosaicFormer achieves the best performance in terms of all the evaluation metrics in the MIPI 2024 challenge on Demosaic for Hybridevs Camera.

Data aggregation as well as high-resolution image generation both usually come at the risk of involving aliases, i.e.~standard architectures put their ability to reconstruct the model input in jeopardy to reach high PSNR values on validation data. The price to be paid is low model robustness. In this work, we show that simply providing alias-free paths in state-of-the-art reconstruction transformers supports improved model robustness at low costs on the restoration performance. We do so by proposing BOA-Restormer, a transformer-based image restoration model that executes downsampling and upsampling operations partly in the frequency domain to ensure alias-free paths along the entire model while potentially preserving all relevant high-frequency information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tags:...</summary><p>Tags: Adversarial attack, image restoration, image deblurring, frequency sampling</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Denoising Capability of Diffusion Prior for Solving Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06959v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent emergence of diffusion models has significantly advanced the precision of learnable priors, presenting innovative avenues for addressing inverse problems. Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

| **[The Perception-Robustness Tradeoff in Deterministic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09253v4)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the behavior of deterministic methods for solving inverse problems in imaging. These methods are commonly designed to achieve two goals: (1) attaining high perceptual quality, and (2) generating reconstructions that are consistent with the measurements. We provide a rigorous proof that the better a predictor satisfies these two requirements, the larger its Lipschitz constant must be, regardless of the nature of the degradation involved. In particular, to approach perfect perceptual quality and perfect consistency, the Lipschitz constant of the model must grow to infinity. This implies that such methods are necessarily more susceptible to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our theory on single image super-resolution algorithms, addressing both noisy and noiseless settings. We also show how this undesired behavior can be leveraged to explore the posterior distribution, thereby allowing the deterministic model to imitate stochastic methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Eye Surgeon: Finding Image Priors through Sparse Generators at Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05288v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Optimal Eye Surgeon (OES), a framework for pruning and training deep image generator networks. Typically, untrained deep convolutional networks, which include image sampling operations, serve as effective image priors (Ulyanov et al., 2018). However, they tend to overfit to noise in image restoration tasks due to being overparameterized. OES addresses this by adaptively pruning networks at random initialization to a level of underparameterization. This process effectively captures low-frequency image components even without training, by just masking. When trained to fit noisy images, these pruned subnetworks, which we term Sparse-DIP, resist overfitting to noise. This benefit arises from underparameterization and the regularization effect of masking, constraining them in the manifold of image priors. We demonstrate that subnetworks pruned through OES surpass other leading pruning methods, such as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which is known to be suboptimal for image recovery tasks (Wu et al., 2023). Our extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of OES-masks and the characteristics of sparse-subnetworks for image generation.

However, they require large amounts of computational power for training and inference. In this paper, we propose lightweight diffusion models for image inpainting that can be trained on a single image, or a few images. We show that our approach competes with large state-of-the-art models in specific cases. We also show that training a model on a single image is particularly relevant for image acquisition modality that differ from the RGB images of standard learning databases. We show results in three different contexts: texture images, line drawing images, and materials BRDF, for which we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of realism, with a computational load that is greatly reduced compared to concurrent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Test-Time Degradation Adaptation for Open-Set Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02197v4)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contrast to close-set scenarios that restore images from a predefined set of degradations, open-set image restoration aims to handle the unknown degradations that were unforeseen during the pretraining phase, which is less-touched as far as we know. This work study this challenging problem and reveal its essence as unidentified distribution shifts between the test and training data. Recently, test-time adaptation has emerged as a fundamental method to address this inherent disparities. Inspired by it, we propose a test-time degradation adaptation framework for open-set image restoration, which consists of three components, \textit{i.e.}, i) a pre-trained and degradation-agnostic diffusion model for generating clean images, ii) a test-time degradation adapter adapts the unknown degradations based on the input image during the testing phase, and iii) the adapter-guided image restoration guides the model through the adapter to produce the corresponding clean image. Through experiments on multiple degradations, we show that our method achieves comparable even better performance than those task-specific methods.

We first propose an extrapolated DYS method to effectively solve a class of structural nonconvex optimization problems that involve minimizing the sum of three possible nonconvex functions. Our approach provides an algorithmic framework that encompasses both extrapolated forward-backward splitting and extrapolated Douglas-Rachford splitting methods. To establish the convergence of the proposed method, we rigorously analyze its behavior based on the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property, subject to some tight parameter conditions. Moreover, we introduce two extrapolated PnP-DYS methods with convergence guarantee, where the traditional regularization prior is replaced by a gradient step-based denoiser. This denoiser is designed using a differentiable neural network and can be reformulated as the proximal operator of a specific nonconvex functional. We conduct extensive experiments on image deblurring and image super-resolution problems, where our results showcase the advantage of the extrapolation strategy and the superior performance of the learning-based model that incorporates the PnP denoiser in terms of achieving high-quality recovery images.</p></details> | 37 Pages |
| **[Deep Block Proximal Linearised Minimisation Algorithm for Non-convex Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02458v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is typically addressed through non-convex inverse problems, which are often solved using first-order block-wise splitting methods. In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 6 tables |
| **[Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application. In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms. Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlation Matching Transformation Transformers for UHD Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00629v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes UHDformer, a general Transformer for Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration. UHDformer contains two learning spaces: (a) learning in high-resolution space and (b) learning in low-resolution space. The former learns multi-level high-resolution features and fuses low-high features and reconstructs the residual images, while the latter explores more representative features learning from the high-resolution ones to facilitate better restoration. To better improve feature representation in low-resolution space, we propose to build feature transformation from the high-resolution space to the low-resolution one. To that end, we propose two new modules: Dual-path Correlation Matching Transformation module (DualCMT) and Adaptive Channel Modulator (ACM). The DualCMT selects top C/r (r is greater or equal to 1 which controls the squeezing level) correlation channels from the max-pooling/mean-pooling high-resolution features to replace low-resolution ones in Transformers, which can effectively squeeze useless content to improve the feature representation in low-resolution space to facilitate better recovery. The ACM is exploited to adaptively modulate multi-level high-resolution features, enabling to provide more useful features to low-resolution space for better learning. Experimental results show that our UHDformer reduces about ninety-seven percent model sizes compared with most state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving performance under different training sets on 3 UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring.

| **[Efficient Degradation-aware Any Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15475v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing missing details from degraded low-quality inputs poses a significant challenge. Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the efficacy of learning large models capable of addressing various degradations simultaneously. Nonetheless, these approaches introduce considerable computational overhead and complex learning paradigms, limiting their practical utility. In response, we propose \textit{DaAIR}, an efficient All-in-One image restorer employing a Degradation-aware Learner (DaLe) in the low-rank regime to collaboratively mine shared aspects and subtle nuances across diverse degradations, generating a degradation-aware embedding. By dynamically allocating model capacity to input degradations, we realize an efficient restorer integrating holistic and specific learning within a unified model. Furthermore, DaAIR introduces a cost-efficient parameter update mechanism that enhances degradation awareness while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive comparisons across five image degradations demonstrate that our DaAIR outperforms both state-of-the-art All-in-One models and degradation-specific counterparts, affirming our efficacy and practicality.

| **[Restoration by Generation with Constrained Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17161v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent generative power of denoising diffusion models makes them well-suited for image restoration tasks where the objective is to find the optimal high-quality image within the generative space that closely resembles the input image. We propose a method to adapt a pretrained diffusion model for image restoration by simply adding noise to the input image to be restored and then denoise. Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space, we can then leverage the sampling strategy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration, where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space. This approach allows us to produce results that accurately preserve high-frequency details, which previous works are unable to do.

| **[Exposure Bracketing is All You Need for Unifying Image Restoration and Enhancement Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00766v4)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is highly desired but challenging to acquire high-quality photos with clear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus on specific restoration or enhancement problems, and do not fully explore the potential of utilizing multiple images. Motivated by the fact that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize exposure bracketing photography to unify image restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art multi-image processing ones.

| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the Vision Transformers (ViTs) emergence has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (i.e., SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, various methods have been proposed to solve Image Restoration (IR) tasks using a pre-trained diffusion model leading to state-of-the-art performance. However, most of these methods assume that the degradation operator in the IR task is completely known. Furthermore, a common characteristic among these approaches is that they alter the diffusion sampling process in order to satisfy the consistency with the degraded input image. This choice has recently been shown to be sub-optimal and to cause the restored image to deviate from the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e., not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/hamadichihaoui/BIRD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serpent: Scalable and Efficient Image Restoration via Multi-scale Structured State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17902v2)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054v5)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p></details> |  |

We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4$\times$ super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps.

Valuable insights into these feasible solutions and their associated probabilities are embedded in the posterior distribution. However, when confronted with data of high dimensionality (such as images), visualizing this distribution becomes a formidable challenge, necessitating the application of effective summarization techniques before user examination. In this work, we introduce a new approach for visualizing posteriors across multiple levels of granularity using tree-valued predictions. Our method predicts a tree-valued hierarchical summarization of the posterior distribution for any input measurement, in a single forward pass of a neural network. We showcase the efficacy of our approach across diverse datasets and image restoration challenges, highlighting its prowess in uncertainty quantification and visualization. Our findings reveal that our method performs comparably to a baseline that hierarchically clusters samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, yet achieves this with orders of magnitude greater speed.</p></details> | 32 pages, 21 figures |

However, the curse of dimensionality in 3D medical data leads mainstream volume-wise methods to suffer from high resource consumption and challenges models to successfully capture the natural distribution, resulting in inevitable volume inconsistency and artifacts. Some recent works attempt to simplify generation in the latent space but lack the capability to efficiently model intricate image details. To address these limitations, we present Blaze3DM, a novel approach that enables fast and high-fidelity generation by integrating compact triplane neural field and powerful diffusion model. In technique, Blaze3DM begins by optimizing data-dependent triplane embeddings and a shared decoder simultaneously, reconstructing each triplane back to the corresponding 3D volume. To further enhance 3D consistency, we introduce a lightweight 3D aware module to model the correlation of three vertical planes. Then, diffusion model is trained on latent triplane embeddings and achieves both unconditional and conditional triplane generation, which is finally decoded to arbitrary size volume. Extensive experiments on zero-shot 3D medical inverse problem solving, including sparse-view CT, limited-angle CT, compressed-sensing MRI, and MRI isotropic super-resolution, demonstrate that Blaze3DM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also markedly improves computational efficiency over existing methods (22~40x faster than previous work).</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Visual State Space Model for Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14343v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance in image restoration. ViTs typically yield superior results in image restoration compared to CNNs due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and input-dependent characteristics. However, the computational complexity of Transformer-based models grows quadratically with the image resolution, limiting their practical appeal in high-resolution image restoration tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) to visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on benchmark datasets and real-captured images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image super-resolution algorithms.</p></details> |  |

This results in significantly improved image clarity and color fidelity, while avoiding over-enhancement and unnatural color shifts.

Performance evaluations confirm that our model not only surpasses existing methods in enhancing low-light images but also maintains a minimal computational footprint.</p></details> |  |

Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color infection in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a sweet balance of regularization functionals on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color infection reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and manoeuvrability of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,10figures |
| **[Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emphasizing Crucial Features for Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11468v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a challenging ill-posed problem which estimates latent sharp image from its degraded counterpart. Although the existing methods have achieved promising performance by designing novelty architecture of module, they ignore the fact that different regions in a corrupted image undergo varying degrees of degradation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective framework to adapt to varying degrees of degradation across different regions for image restoration. Specifically, we design a spatial and frequency attention mechanism (SFAM) to emphasize crucial features for restoration. SFAM consists of two modules: the spatial domain attention module (SDAM) and the frequency domain attention module (FDAM). The SFAM discerns the degradation location through spatial selective attention and channel selective attention in the spatial domain, while the FDAM enhances high-frequency signals to amplify the disparities between sharp and degraded image pairs in the spectral domain. Additionally, to capture global range information, we introduce a multi-scale block (MSBlock) that consists of three scale branches, each containing multiple simplified channel attention blocks (SCABlocks) and a multi-scale feed-forward block (MSFBlock). Finally, we propose our ECFNet, which integrates the aforementioned components into a U-shaped backbone for recovering high-quality images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ECFNet, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Restoration Through Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Bridge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10299v2)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models exhibit powerful generative capabilities enabling noise mapping to data via reverse stochastic differential equations. However, in image restoration, the focus is on the mapping relationship from low-quality to high-quality images. Regarding this issue, we introduce the Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Bridge (GOUB) model. By leveraging the natural mean-reverting property of the generalized OU process and further eliminating the variance of its steady-state distribution through the Doob's h-transform, we achieve diffusion mappings from point to point enabling the recovery of high-quality images from low-quality ones. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence shared by various bridge models, all of which are special instances of GOUB and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Additionally, we present the corresponding Mean-ODE model adept at capturing both pixel-level details and structural perceptions. Experimental outcomes showcase the state-of-the-art performance achieved by both models across diverse tasks, including inpainting, deraining, and super-resolution.

| **[A Versatile Framework for Analyzing Galaxy Image Data by Implanting Human-in-the-loop on a Large Vision Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10890v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of astronomical datasets provides an unprecedented opportunity for humans to gain insight into the Universe. However, effectively analyzing this vast amount of data poses a significant challenge. Astronomers are turning to deep learning techniques to address this, but the methods are limited by their specific training sets, leading to considerable duplicate workloads too. Hence, as an example to present how to overcome the issue, we built a framework for general analysis of galaxy images, based on a large vision model (LVM) plus downstream tasks (DST), including galaxy morphological classification, image restoration, object detection, parameter extraction, and more. Considering the low signal-to-noise ratio of galaxy images and the imbalanced distribution of galaxy categories, we have incorporated a Human-in-the-loop (HITL) module into our large vision model, which leverages human knowledge to enhance the reliability and interpretability of processing galaxy images interactively. The proposed framework exhibits notable few-shot learning capabilities and versatile adaptability to all the abovementioned tasks on galaxy images in the DESI legacy imaging surveys. Expressly, for object detection, trained by 1000 data points, our DST upon the LVM achieves an accuracy of 96.7%, while ResNet50 plus Mask R-CNN gives an accuracy of 93.1%; for morphology classification, to obtain AUC ~0.9, LVM plus DST and HITL only requests 1/50 training sets compared to ResNet18. Expectedly, multimodal data can be integrated similarly, which opens up possibilities for conducting joint analyses with datasets spanning diverse domains in the era of multi-message astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 figures, to be published on Chinese Physics C</p></details> |
| **[Step-Calibrated Diffusion for Biomedical Optical Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13680v3)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality, high-resolution medical imaging is essential for clinical care. Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired image restoration method that views the image restoration problem as completing the finishing steps of a diffusion-based image generation task. RSCD uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the severity of image degradation and the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

| **[RSDehamba: Lightweight Vision Mamba for Remote Sensing Satellite Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10030v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image dehazing (RSID) aims to remove nonuniform and physically irregular haze factors for high-quality image restoration. The emergence of CNNs and Transformers has taken extraordinary strides in the RSID arena. However, these methods often struggle to demonstrate the balance of adequate long-range dependency modeling and maintaining computational efficiency. To this end, we propose the first lightweight network on the mamba-based model called RSDhamba in the field of RSID. Greatly inspired by the recent rise of Selective State Space Model (SSM) for its superior performance in modeling linear complexity and remote dependencies, our designed RSDehamba integrates the SSM framework into the U-Net architecture. Specifically, we propose the Vision Dehamba Block (VDB) as the core component of the overall network, which utilizes the linear complexity of SSM to achieve the capability of global context encoding. Simultaneously, the Direction-aware Scan Module (DSM) is designed to dynamically aggregate feature exchanges over different directional domains to effectively enhance the flexibility of sensing the spatially varying distribution of haze. In this way, our RSDhamba fully demonstrates the superiority of spatial distance capture dependencies and channel information exchange for better extraction of haze features. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks validate the surpassing performance of our RSDehamba against existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The RAIM challenge constructed a benchmark for image restoration in the wild, including real-world images with/without reference ground truth in various scenarios from real applications. The participants were required to restore the real-captured images from complex and unknown degradation, where generative perceptual quality and fidelity are desired in the restoration result.

Task two used unpaired images, and a comprehensive user study was conducted. The challenge attracted more than 200 registrations, where 39 of them submitted results with more than 400 submissions. Top-ranked methods improved the state-of-the-art restoration performance and obtained unanimous recognition from all 18 judges.

| **[FRRffusion: Unveiling Authenticity with Diffusion-Based Face Retouching Reversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07582v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unveiling the real appearance of retouched faces to prevent malicious users from deceptive advertising and economic fraud has been an increasing concern in the era of digital economics. This article makes the first attempt to investigate the face retouching reversal (FRR) problem. We first collect an FRR dataset, named deepFRR, which contains 50,000 StyleGAN-generated high-resolution (1024*1024) facial images and their corresponding retouched ones by a commercial online API. To our best knowledge, deepFRR is the first FRR dataset tailored for training the deep FRR models. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-based FRR approach (FRRffusion) for the FRR task. Our FRRffusion consists of a coarse-to-fine two-stage network: A diffusion-based Facial Morpho-Architectonic Restorer (FMAR) is constructed to generate the basic contours of low-resolution faces in the first stage, while a Transformer-based Hyperrealistic Facial Detail Generator (HFDG) is designed to create high-resolution facial details in the second stage. Tested on deepFRR, our FRRffusion surpasses the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods by a large margin in four widespread quantitative metrics. Especially, the de-retouched images by our FRRffusion are visually much closer to the raw face images than both the retouched face images and those restored by the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods in terms of qualitative evaluation with 85 subjects. These results sufficiently validate the efficacy of our work, bridging the recently-standing gap between the FRR and generic image restoration tasks. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/GZHU-DVL/FRRffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Visualization via Low-Dimensional Posterior Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07804v2)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In ill-posed inverse problems, it is commonly desirable to obtain insight into the full spectrum of plausible solutions, rather than extracting only a single reconstruction. Information about the plausible solutions and their likelihoods is encoded in the posterior distribution. However, for high-dimensional data, this distribution is challenging to visualize. In this work, we introduce a new approach for estimating and visualizing posteriors by employing energy-based models (EBMs) over low-dimensional subspaces. Specifically, we train a conditional EBM that receives an input measurement and a set of directions that span some low-dimensional subspace of solutions, and outputs the probability density function of the posterior within that space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across a diverse range of datasets and image restoration problems, showcasing its strength in uncertainty quantification and visualization. As we show, our method outperforms a baseline that projects samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, while being orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, it is more accurate than a baseline that assumes a Gaussian posterior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport: Towards Structure-Preserving Unpaired and Paired Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02843v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based image restoration methods generally struggle with faithfully preserving the structures of the original image. In this work, we propose a novel Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (RCOT) approach, which models image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for both unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a unique degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we first formalize a Fourier residual-guided OT objective by incorporating the degradation-specific information of the residual into the transport cost. We further design the transport map as a two-pass RCOT map that comprises a base model and a refinement process, in which the transport residual is computed by the base model in the first pass and then encoded as a degradation-specific embedding to condition the second-pass restoration. By duality, the RCOT problem is transformed into a minimax optimization problem, which can be solved by adversarially training neural networks. Extensive experiments on multiple restoration tasks show that RCOT achieves competitive performance in terms of both distortion measures and perceptual quality, restoring images with more faithful structures as compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

However, given the local nature of the convolutional operator, they struggle to capture global information. The promise of attention mechanisms in Transformers is to circumvent this problem, but it comes at the cost of intensive computational overhead. Many recent studies in image restoration have focused on solving the challenge of balancing performance and computational cost via Transformer variants. In this paper, we present CascadedGaze Network (CGNet), an encoder-decoder architecture that employs Global Context Extractor (GCE), a novel and efficient way to capture global information for image restoration. The GCE module leverages small kernels across convolutional layers to learn global dependencies, without requiring self-attention. Extensive experimental results show that our computationally efficient approach performs competitively to a range of state-of-the-art methods on synthetic image denoising and single image deblurring tasks, and pushes the performance boundary further on the real image denoising task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2024. 20 pages</p></details> |

Prevailing methods address distinct restoration tasks independently, leading to intricate systems and the incapability to harness the potential synergies of multi-task learning. To overcome this challenge, we propose DocRes, a generalist model that unifies five document image restoration tasks including dewarping, deshadowing, appearance enhancement, deblurring, and binarization. To instruct DocRes to perform various restoration tasks, we propose a novel visual prompt approach called Dynamic Task-Specific Prompt (DTSPrompt). The DTSPrompt for different tasks comprises distinct prior features, which are additional characteristics extracted from the input image. Beyond its role as a cue for task-specific execution, DTSPrompt can also serve as supplementary information to enhance the model's performance. Moreover, DTSPrompt is more flexible than prior visual prompt approaches as it can be seamlessly applied and adapted to inputs with high and variable resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that DocRes achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art task-specific models. This underscores the potential of DocRes across a broader spectrum of document image restoration tasks.

Among these methods, semantic segmentation algorithms have demonstrated promising results in pixel-wise crack detection tasks. However, training such networks requires a large amount of human-annotated datasets with pixel-level annotations, which is a highly labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Moreover, supervised learning-based methods often struggle with poor generalizability in unseen datasets. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised pixel-wise road crack detection network, known as UP-CrackNet. Our approach first generates multi-scale square masks and randomly selects them to corrupt undamaged road images by removing certain regions. Subsequently, a generative adversarial network is trained to restore the corrupted regions by leveraging the semantic context learned from surrounding uncorrupted regions. During the testing phase, an error map is generated by calculating the difference between the input and restored images, which allows for pixel-wise crack detection. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UP-CrackNet outperforms other general-purpose unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, and exhibits satisfactory performance and superior generalizability when compared with state-of-the-art supervised crack segmentation algorithms. Our source code is publicly available at mias.group/UP-CrackNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Image Restoration For Image Anti-Forensics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02751v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While image forensics is concerned with whether an image has been tampered with, image anti-forensics attempts to prevent image forensics methods from detecting tampered images. The competition between these two fields started long before the advancement of deep learning. JPEG compression, blurring and noising, which are simple methods by today's standards, have long been used for anti-forensics and have been the subject of much research in both forensics and anti-forensics. Although these traditional methods are old, they make it difficult to detect fake images and are used for data augmentation in training deep image forgery detection models. In addition to making the image difficult to detect, these methods leave traces on the image and consequently degrade the image quality. Separate image forensics methods have also been developed to detect these traces. In this study, we go one step further and improve the image quality after these methods with deep image restoration models and make it harder to detect the forged image. We evaluate the impact of these methods on image quality. We then test both our proposed methods with deep learning and methods without deep learning on the two best existing image manipulation detection models. In the obtained results, we show how existing image forgery detection models fail against the proposed methods. Code implementation will be publicly available at https://github.com/99eren99/DIRFIAF .</p></details> |  |

The video data obtained from these telescopes differ significantly from data for standard 3D reconstruction tasks, characterized by intense motion blur, atmospheric turbulence, pervasive background light pollution, extended focal length and constrained observational perspectives. To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We proceed with the application of an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm for reconstructing the 3D model. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach using both synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.</p></details> |  |

Classical model-based methods and recent deep learning (DL)-based methods represent two different methodologies for this problem, each with their own merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image restoration method, aiming to integrate both the advantages of them. Specifically, we construct a general Bayesian generative model for the blind IR, which explicitly depicts the degradation process. In this proposed model, a pixel-wise non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution is employed to fit the image noise. It is with more flexibility than the simple i.i.d. Gaussian or Laplacian distributions as adopted in most of conventional methods, so as to handle more complicated noise types contained in the image degradation. To solve the model, we design a variational inference algorithm where all the expected posteriori distributions are parameterized as deep neural networks to increase their model capability. Notably, such an inference algorithm induces a unified framework to jointly deal with the tasks of degradation estimation and image restoration. Further, the degradation information estimated in the former task is utilized to guide the latter IR process. Experiments on two typical blind IR tasks, namely image denoising and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI@2024.

It aims to mitigate compression artifacts caused by unknown quality factors, particularly with JPEG codecs. Existing works on blind CIR often seek assistance from a quality factor prediction network to facilitate their network to restore compressed images. However, the predicted numerical quality factor lacks spatial information, preventing network adaptability toward image contents. Recent studies in prompt-learning-based image restoration have showcased the potential of prompts to generalize across varied degradation types and degrees. This motivated us to design a prompt-learning-based compressed image restoration network, dubbed PromptCIR, which can effectively restore images from various compress levels. Specifically, PromptCIR exploits prompts to encode compression information implicitly, where prompts directly interact with soft weights generated from image features, thus providing dynamic content-aware and distortion-aware guidance for the restoration process. The light-weight prompts enable our method to adapt to different compression levels, while introducing minimal parameter overhead. Overall, PromptCIR leverages the powerful transformer-based backbone with the dynamic prompt module to proficiently handle blind CIR tasks, winning first place in the NTIRE 2024 challenge of blind compressed image enhancement track. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our proposed PromptCIR.

In recent years supervised learning approaches have become a popular strategy attempting to tackle this task. Unfortunately, most supervised learning-based methods are highly demanding in terms of computational resources and training data (sample complexity). In addition, trained models are sensitive to domain changes, such as varying acquisition systems, signal sampling rates, resolution and contrast. In this work, we try to answer a fundamental question: Can supervised learning models generalize well solely by learning from one image or even part of an image? If so, then what is the minimal amount of patches required to achieve acceptable generalization? To this end, we focus on an efficient patch-based learning framework that requires a single image input-output pair for training. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach for supervised image deblurring and super-resolution. Our results showcase significant improvement of learning models' sample efficiency, generalization and time complexity, that can hopefully be leveraged for future real-time applications, and applied to other signals and modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.14267</p></details> |

In this paper, we present Make-An-Agent, a novel policy parameter generator that leverages the power of conditional diffusion models for behavior-to-policy generation. Guided by behavior embeddings that encode trajectory information, our policy generator synthesizes latent parameter representations, which can then be decoded into policy networks. Trained on policy network checkpoints and their corresponding trajectories, our generation model demonstrates remarkable versatility and scalability on multiple tasks and has a strong generalization ability on unseen tasks to output well-performed policies with only few-shot demonstrations as inputs. We showcase its efficacy and efficiency on various domains and tasks, including varying objectives, behaviors, and even across different robot manipulators. Beyond simulation, we directly deploy policies generated by Make-An-Agent onto real-world robots on locomotion tasks.</p></details> |  |

InVi targets controlled manipulation of objects and blending them seamlessly into a background video unlike existing video editing methods that focus on comprehensive re-styling or entire scene alterations. To achieve this goal, we tackle two key challenges. Firstly, for high quality control and blending, we employ a two-step process involving inpainting and matching. This process begins with inserting the object into a single frame using a ControlNet-based inpainting diffusion model, and then generating subsequent frames conditioned on features from an inpainted frame as an anchor to minimize the domain gap between the background and the object. Secondly, to ensure temporal coherence, we replace the diffusion model's self-attention layers with extended-attention layers. The anchor frame features serve as the keys and values for these layers, enhancing consistency across frames. Our approach removes the need for video-specific fine-tuning, presenting an efficient and adaptable solution. Experimental results demonstrate that InVi achieves realistic object insertion with consistent blending and coherence across frames, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Previous work has proposed to generate data for image classifier training given limited real data access. However, these methods struggle to generate in-distribution images or depict fine-grained features, thereby hindering the generalization of classification models trained on synthetic datasets. We propose DataDream, a framework for synthesizing classification datasets that more faithfully represents the real data distribution when guided by few-shot examples of the target classes. DataDream fine-tunes LoRA weights for the image generation model on the few real images before generating the training data using the adapted model. We then fine-tune LoRA weights for CLIP using the synthetic data to improve downstream image classification over previous approaches on a large variety of datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of DataDream through extensive experiments, surpassing state-of-the-art classification accuracy with few-shot data across 7 out of 10 datasets, while being competitive on the other 3.

| **[Optical Diffusion Models for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10897v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models generate new samples by progressively decreasing the noise from the initially provided random distribution. This inference procedure generally utilizes a trained neural network numerous times to obtain the final output, creating significant latency and energy consumption on digital electronic hardware such as GPUs. In this study, we demonstrate that the propagation of a light beam through a semi-transparent medium can be programmed to implement a denoising diffusion model on image samples. This framework projects noisy image patterns through passive diffractive optical layers, which collectively only transmit the predicted noise term in the image. The optical transparent layers, which are trained with an online training approach, backpropagating the error to the analytical model of the system, are passive and kept the same across different steps of denoising. Hence this method enables high-speed image generation with minimal power consumption, benefiting from the bandwidth and energy efficiency of optical information processing.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[R3D-AD: Reconstruction via Diffusion for 3D Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10862v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D anomaly detection plays a crucial role in monitoring parts for localized inherent defects in precision manufacturing. Embedding-based and reconstruction-based approaches are among the most popular and successful methods. However, there are two major challenges to the practical application of the current approaches: 1) the embedded models suffer the prohibitive computational and storage due to the memory bank structure; 2) the reconstructive models based on the MAE mechanism fail to detect anomalies in the unmasked regions. In this paper, we propose R3D-AD, reconstructing anomalous point clouds by diffusion model for precise 3D anomaly detection. Our approach capitalizes on the data distribution conversion of the diffusion process to entirely obscure the input's anomalous geometry. It step-wisely learns a strict point-level displacement behavior, which methodically corrects the aberrant points. To increase the generalization of the model, we further present a novel 3D anomaly simulation strategy named Patch-Gen to generate realistic and diverse defect shapes, which narrows the domain gap between training and testing. Our R3D-AD ensures a uniform spatial transformation, which allows straightforwardly generating anomaly results by distance comparison. Extensive experiments show that our R3D-AD outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 73.4% Image-level AUROC on the Real3D-AD dataset and 74.9% Image-level AUROC on the Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset with an exceptional efficiency.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

| **[Animate Your Motion: Turning Still Images into Dynamic Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10179v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, diffusion models have made remarkable strides in text-to-video generation, sparking a quest for enhanced control over video outputs to more accurately reflect user intentions. Traditional efforts predominantly focus on employing either semantic cues, like images or depth maps, or motion-based conditions, like moving sketches or object bounding boxes. Semantic inputs offer a rich scene context but lack detailed motion specificity; conversely, motion inputs provide precise trajectory information but miss the broader semantic narrative. For the first time, we integrate both semantic and motion cues within a diffusion model for video generation, as demonstrated in Fig 1. To this end, we introduce the Scene and Motion Conditional Diffusion (SMCD), a novel methodology for managing multimodal inputs. It incorporates a recognized motion conditioning module and investigates various approaches to integrate scene conditions, promoting synergy between different modalities. For model training, we separate the conditions for the two modalities, introducing a two-stage training pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that our design significantly enhances video quality, motion precision, and semantic coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2024)</p></details> |

Spanning Tree-based Graph Generation (STGG) is a promising approach to ensure the generation of valid molecules, outperforming state-of-the-art SMILES and graph diffusion models for unconditional generation. In the real world, we want to be able to generate molecules conditional on one or multiple desired properties rather than unconditionally. Thus, in this work, we extend STGG to multi-property-conditional generation. Our approach, STGG+, incorporates a modern Transformer architecture, random masking of properties during training (enabling conditioning on any subset of properties and classifier-free guidance), an auxiliary property-prediction loss (allowing the model to self-criticize molecules and select the best ones), and other improvements. We show that STGG+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution conditional generation, and reward maximization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/AnyMolGenCritic</p></details> |

Despite extensive research on denoising across various timesteps and noise levels, a conflict persists regarding the relative difficulties of the denoising tasks. While various studies argue that lower timesteps present more challenging tasks, others contend that higher timesteps are more difficult. To address this conflict, our study undertakes a comprehensive examination of task difficulties, focusing on convergence behavior and changes in relative entropy between consecutive probability distributions across timesteps. Our observational study reveals that denoising at earlier timesteps poses challenges characterized by slower convergence and higher relative entropy, indicating increased task difficulty at these lower timesteps. Building on these observations, we introduce an easy-to-hard learning scheme, drawing from curriculum learning, to enhance the training process of diffusion models. By organizing timesteps or noise levels into clusters and training models with ascending orders of difficulty, we facilitate an order-aware training regime, progressing from easier to harder denoising tasks, thereby deviating from the conventional approach of training diffusion models simultaneously across all timesteps. Our approach leads to improved performance and faster convergence by leveraging benefits of curriculum learning, while maintaining orthogonality with existing improvements in diffusion training techniques. We validate these advantages through comprehensive experiments in image generation tasks, including unconditional, class-conditional, and text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often generate factually inconsistent images, failing to accurately reflect the factual information and common sense conveyed by the input text prompts. We refer to this issue as Image hallucination. Drawing from studies on hallucinations in language models, we classify this problem into three types and propose a methodology that uses factual images retrieved from external sources to generate realistic images. Depending on the nature of the hallucination, we employ off-the-shelf image editing tools, either InstructPix2Pix or IP-Adapter, to leverage factual information from the retrieved image. This approach enables the generation of images that accurately reflect the facts and common sense.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for oral presentation at the IJCAI 2024 Workshop on Trustworthy Interactive Decision-Making with Foundation Models</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Residual Guided Diffusion Framework for Event-Driven Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10636v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based video reconstruction has garnered increasing attention due to its advantages, such as high dynamic range and rapid motion capture capabilities. However, current methods often prioritize the extraction of temporal information from continuous event flow, leading to an overemphasis on low-frequency texture features in the scene, resulting in over-smoothing and blurry artifacts. Addressing this challenge necessitates the integration of conditional information, encompassing temporal features, low-frequency texture, and high-frequency events, to guide the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) in producing accurate and natural outputs. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel approach, the Temporal Residual Guided Diffusion Framework, which effectively leverages both temporal and frequency-based event priors. Our framework incorporates three key conditioning modules: a pre-trained low-frequency intensity estimation module, a temporal recurrent encoder module, and an attention-based high-frequency prior enhancement module. In order to capture temporal scene variations from the events at the current moment, we employ a temporal-domain residual image as the target for the diffusion model. Through the combination of these three conditioning paths and the temporal residual framework, our framework excels in reconstructing high-quality videos from event flow, mitigating issues such as artifacts and over-smoothing commonly observed in previous approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of our framework compared to prior event-based reconstruction methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |
| **[WildVidFit: Video Virtual Try-On in the Wild via Image-Based Controlled Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10625v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video virtual try-on aims to generate realistic sequences that maintain garment identity and adapt to a person's pose and body shape in source videos. Traditional image-based methods, relying on warping and blending, struggle with complex human movements and occlusions, limiting their effectiveness in video try-on applications. Moreover, video-based models require extensive, high-quality data and substantial computational resources. To tackle these issues, we reconceptualize video try-on as a process of generating videos conditioned on garment descriptions and human motion. Our solution, WildVidFit, employs image-based controlled diffusion models for a streamlined, one-stage approach. This model, conditioned on specific garments and individuals, is trained on still images rather than videos. It leverages diffusion guidance from pre-trained models including a video masked autoencoder for segment smoothness improvement and a self-supervised model for feature alignment of adjacent frame in the latent space. This integration markedly boosts the model's ability to maintain temporal coherence, enabling more effective video try-on within an image-based framework. Our experiments on the VITON-HD and DressCode datasets, along with tests on the VVT and TikTok datasets, demonstrate WildVidFit's capability to generate fluid and coherent videos.

Yet, integrating realistic object visualizations seamlessly into new or existing backgrounds without extensive training remains a challenge. This paper introduces InsertDiffusion, a novel, training-free diffusion architecture that efficiently embeds objects into images while preserving their structural and identity characteristics. Our approach utilizes off-the-shelf generative models and eliminates the need for fine-tuning, making it ideal for rapid and adaptable visualizations in product design and marketing. We demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in terms of image realism and alignment with input conditions. By decomposing the generation task into independent steps, InsertDiffusion offers a scalable solution that extends the capabilities of diffusion models for practical applications, achieving high-quality visualizations that maintain the authenticity of the original objects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Audio Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09821v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of audio playback devices and fast data transmission, the demand for high sound quality is rising for both entertainment and communications. In this quest for better sound quality, challenges emerge from distortions and interferences originating at the recording side or caused by an imperfect transmission pipeline. To address this problem, audio restoration methods aim to recover clean sound signals from the corrupted input data. We present here audio restoration algorithms based on diffusion models, with a focus on speech enhancement and music restoration tasks. Traditional approaches, often grounded in handcrafted rules and statistical heuristics, have shaped our understanding of audio signals. In the past decades, there has been a notable shift towards data-driven methods that exploit the modeling capabilities of DNNs. Deep generative models, and among them diffusion models, have emerged as powerful techniques for learning complex data distributions. However, relying solely on DNN-based learning approaches carries the risk of reducing interpretability, particularly when employing end-to-end models. Nonetheless, data-driven approaches allow more flexibility in comparison to statistical model-based frameworks, whose performance depends on distributional and statistical assumptions that can be difficult to guarantee. Here, we aim to show that diffusion models can combine the best of both worlds and offer the opportunity to design audio restoration algorithms with a good degree of interpretability and a remarkable performance in terms of sound quality. We explain the diffusion formalism and its application to the conditional generation of clean audio signals. We believe that diffusion models open an exciting field of research with the potential to spawn new audio restoration algorithms that are natural-sounding and remain robust in difficult acoustic situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently in revision for IEEE Signal Processing Magazine Special Issue "Model-based and Data-Driven Audio Signal Processing"</p></details> |

In this work, we propose Diffusion-of-Thought (DoT), a novel approach that integrates diffusion models with Chain-of-Thought, a well-established technique for improving the reasoning ability of autoregressive language models. In contrast to autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT allows reasoning steps to diffuse over time through a diffusion language model and offers greater flexibility in trading-off computation for reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication, boolean logic, and grade school math problems, with a small diffusion model outperforming a much larger autoregressive model in both efficiency and accuracy. In addition to that, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding. Our findings contribute to the understanding and development of reasoning with diffusion language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Multi...</summary><p>Multiple updates (add boolean logic dataset, add DoT based on SEDD model and add detailed mathematical formulation in Appendix)</p></details> |

Notably, we demonstrate the manipulation of curvature properties, achieving diverse visual effects, such as fish-eye, panoramic views, and spherical texturing using a single diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://anylens-diffusion.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Unconditional Latent Diffusion Models Memorize Patient Imaging Data: Implications for Openly Sharing Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01054v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI models present a wide range of applications in the field of medicine. However, achieving optimal performance requires access to extensive healthcare data, which is often not readily available. Furthermore, the imperative to preserve patient privacy restricts patient data sharing with third parties and even within institutes. Recently, generative AI models have been gaining traction for facilitating open-data sharing by proposing synthetic data as surrogates of real patient data. Despite the promise, these models are susceptible to patient data memorization, where models generate patient data copies instead of novel synthetic samples. Considering the importance of the problem, it has received little attention in the medical imaging community. To this end, we assess memorization in unconditional latent diffusion models. We train 2D and 3D latent diffusion models on CT, MR, and X-ray datasets for synthetic data generation. Afterwards, we detect the amount of training data memorized utilizing our self-supervised approach and further investigate various factors that can influence memorization. Our findings show a surprisingly high degree of patient data memorization across all datasets, with approximately 40.9% of patient data being memorized and 78.5% of synthetic samples identified as patient data copies on average in our experiments. Further analyses reveal that using augmentation strategies during training can reduce memorization while over-training the models can enhance it. Although increasing the dataset size does not reduce memorization and might even enhance it, it does lower the probability of a synthetic sample being a patient data copy. Collectively, our results emphasize the importance of carefully training generative models on private medical imaging datasets, and examining the synthetic data to ensure patient privacy before sharing it for medical research and applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MagDiff: Multi-Alignment Diffusion for High-Fidelity Video Generation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17338v3)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion model is widely leveraged for either video generation or video editing. As each field has its task-specific problems, it is difficult to merely develop a single diffusion for completing both tasks simultaneously. Video diffusion sorely relying on the text prompt can be adapted to unify the two tasks. However, it lacks a high capability of aligning heterogeneous modalities between text and image, leading to various misalignment problems. In this work, we are the first to propose a unified Multi-alignment Diffusion, dubbed as MagDiff, for both tasks of high-fidelity video generation and editing. The proposed MagDiff introduces three types of alignments, including subject-driven alignment, adaptive prompts alignment, and high-fidelity alignment. Particularly, the subject-driven alignment is put forward to trade off the image and text prompts, serving as a unified foundation generative model for both tasks. The adaptive prompts alignment is introduced to emphasize different strengths of homogeneous and heterogeneous alignments by assigning different values of weights to the image and the text prompts. The high-fidelity alignment is developed to further enhance the fidelity of both video generation and editing by taking the subject image as an additional model input. Experimental results on four benchmarks suggest that our method outperforms the previous method on each task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eta Inversion: Designing an Optimal Eta Function for Diffusion-based Real Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09468v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in the domain of text-guided image generation and, more recently, in text-guided image editing. A commonly adopted strategy for editing real images involves inverting the diffusion process to obtain a noisy representation of the original image, which is then denoised to achieve the desired edits. However, current methods for diffusion inversion often struggle to produce edits that are both faithful to the specified text prompt and closely resemble the source image. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel and adaptable diffusion inversion technique for real image editing, which is grounded in a theoretical analysis of the role of $\eta$ in the DDIM sampling equation for enhanced editability. By designing a universal diffusion inversion method with a time- and region-dependent $\eta$ function, we enable flexible control over the editing extent. Through a comprehensive series of quantitative and qualitative assessments, involving a comparison with a broad array of recent methods, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our method not only sets a new benchmark in the field but also significantly outperforms existing strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

However, existing motion generation methods primarily focus on the direct synthesis of global motions while neglecting the importance of generating and controlling local actions. In this paper, we propose the local action-guided motion diffusion model, which facilitates global motion generation by utilizing local actions as fine-grained control signals. Specifically, we provide an automated method for reference local action sampling and leverage graph attention networks to assess the guiding weight of each local action in the overall motion synthesis. During the diffusion process for synthesizing global motion, we calculate the local-action gradient to provide conditional guidance. This local-to-global paradigm reduces the complexity associated with direct global motion generation and promotes motion diversity via sampling diverse actions as conditions. Extensive experiments on two human motion datasets, i.e., HumanML3D and KIT, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, our method provides flexibility in seamlessly combining various local actions and continuous guiding weight adjustment, accommodating diverse user preferences, which may hold potential significance for the community.

Traditional FL approaches typically assume homogeneous hardware resources across FL clients, implying that clients can train a global model within a comparable time frame. However, in practical FL systems, clients often have heterogeneous resources, which impacts their training capacity. This discrepancy underscores the importance of exploring model-heterogeneous FL, a paradigm allowing clients to train different models based on their resource capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce FedTSA, a cluster-based two-stage aggregation method tailored for system heterogeneity in FL. FedTSA begins by clustering clients based on their capabilities, then performs a two-stage aggregation: conventional weight averaging for homogeneous models in Stage 1, and deep mutual learning with a diffusion model for aggregating heterogeneous models in Stage 2. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTSA not only outperforms the baselines but also explores various factors influencing model performance, validating FedTSA as a promising approach for model-heterogeneous FL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, current simulation-based amortized inference methods are simulation-hungry and inflexible: They require the specification of a fixed parametric prior, simulator, and inference tasks ahead of time. Here, we present a new amortized inference method -- the Simformer -- which overcomes these limitations. By training a probabilistic diffusion model with transformer architectures, the Simformer outperforms current state-of-the-art amortized inference approaches on benchmark tasks and is substantially more flexible: It can be applied to models with function-valued parameters, it can handle inference scenarios with missing or unstructured data, and it can sample arbitrary conditionals of the joint distribution of parameters and data, including both posterior and likelihood. We showcase the performance and flexibility of the Simformer on simulators from ecology, epidemiology, and neuroscience, and demonstrate that it opens up new possibilities and application domains for amortized Bayesian inference on simulation-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024), Vienna, Austria.

We draw on recent advances in guided video diffusion models to achieve visually-pleasing text appearances. To do this, we first construct a kinetic typography dataset, comprising about 600K videos. Our dataset is made from a variety of combinations in 584 templates designed by professional motion graphics designers and involves changing each letter's position, glyph, and size (i.e., flying, glitches, chromatic aberration, reflecting effects, etc.). Next, we propose a video diffusion model for kinetic typography. For this, there are three requirements: aesthetic appearances, motion effects, and readable letters. This paper identifies the requirements. For this, we present static and dynamic captions used as spatial and temporal guidance of a video diffusion model, respectively. The static caption describes the overall appearance of the video, such as colors, texture and glyph which represent a shape of each letter. The dynamic caption accounts for the movements of letters and backgrounds. We add one more guidance with zero convolution to determine which text content should be visible in the video. We apply the zero convolution to the text content, and impose it on the diffusion model. Lastly, our glyph loss, only minimizing a difference between the predicted word and its ground-truth, is proposed to make the prediction letters readable. Experiments show that our model generates kinetic typography videos with legible and artistic letter motions based on text prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024, Project page: https://seonmip.github.io/kinety</p></details> |

Deepfake detection offers a viable solution to combat this challenge. Yet, this defensive measure unintentionally fuels the continued refinement of generative models. Watermarking emerges as a proactive and sustainable tactic, preemptively regulating the creation and dissemination of synthesized content. Thus, this paper, as a pioneer, proposes the generative robust audio watermarking method (Groot), presenting a paradigm for proactively supervising the synthesized audio and its source diffusion models. In this paradigm, the processes of watermark generation and audio synthesis occur simultaneously, facilitated by parameter-fixed diffusion models equipped with a dedicated encoder. The watermark embedded within the audio can subsequently be retrieved by a lightweight decoder. The experimental results highlight Groot's outstanding performance, particularly in terms of robustness, surpassing that of the leading state-of-the-art methods. Beyond its impressive resilience against individual post-processing attacks, Groot exhibits exceptional robustness when facing compound attacks, maintaining an average watermark extraction accuracy of around 95%.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiteFocus: Accelerated Diffusion Inference for Long Audio Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10468v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have shown promising results in audio generation, making notable advancements over traditional methods. However, their performance, while impressive with short audio clips, faces challenges when extended to longer audio sequences. These challenges are due to model's self-attention mechanism and training predominantly on 10-second clips, which complicates the extension to longer audio without adaptation. In response to these issues, we introduce a novel approach, LiteFocus that enhances the inference of existing audio latent diffusion models in long audio synthesis. Observed the attention pattern in self-attention, we employ a dual sparse form for attention calculation, designated as same-frequency focus and cross-frequency compensation, which curtails the attention computation under same-frequency constraints, while enhancing audio quality through cross-frequency refillment. LiteFocus demonstrates substantial reduction on inference time with diffusion-based TTA model by 1.99x in synthesizing 80-second audio clips while also obtaining improved audio quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>Interspeech 2024; Code: https://github.com/Yuanshi9815/LiteFocus</p></details> |

Model distillation is one of the most effective directions to accelerate these models. However, previous distillation methods fail to retain the generation quality while requiring a significant amount of images for training, either from real data or synthetically generated by the teacher model. In response to this limitation, we present a novel image-free distillation scheme named $\textbf{SwiftBrush}$. Drawing inspiration from text-to-3D synthesis, in which a 3D neural radiance field that aligns with the input prompt can be obtained from a 2D text-to-image diffusion prior via a specialized loss without the use of any 3D data ground-truth, our approach re-purposes that same loss for distilling a pretrained multi-step text-to-image model to a student network that can generate high-fidelity images with just a single inference step. In spite of its simplicity, our model stands as one of the first one-step text-to-image generators that can produce images of comparable quality to Stable Diffusion without reliance on any training image data. Remarkably, SwiftBrush achieves an FID score of $\textbf{16.67}$ and a CLIP score of $\textbf{0.29}$ on the COCO-30K benchmark, achieving competitive results or even substantially surpassing existing state-of-the-art distillation techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024; Github: https://github.com/VinAIResearch/SwiftBrush</p></details> |

Coverless image steganography (CIS) enhances imperceptibility by not using any cover image. Recent works have utilized text prompts as keys in CIS through diffusion models. However, this approach faces three challenges: invalidated when private prompt is guessed, crafting public prompts for semantic diversity, and the risk of prompt leakage during frequent transmission. To address these issues, we propose DiffStega, an innovative training-free diffusion-based CIS strategy for universal application. DiffStega uses a password-dependent reference image as an image prompt alongside the text, ensuring that only authorized parties can retrieve the hidden information. Furthermore, we develop Noise Flip technique to further secure the steganography against unauthorized decryption.

Along with the temporal and feature correlations, the heterogeneous nature of the feature in the table has been one of the main obstacles in time series tabular data modeling. We tackle this problem by combining the ideas of the variational auto-encoder (VAE) and the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Our model named as \texttt{TimeAutoDiff} has several key advantages including (1) Generality: the ability to handle the broad spectrum of time series tabular data from single to multi-sequence datasets; (2) Good fidelity and utility guarantees: numerical experiments on six publicly available datasets demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in generating time series tabular data, across four metrics measuring fidelity and utility; (3) Fast sampling speed: entire time series data generation as opposed to the sequential data sampling schemes implemented in the existing diffusion-based models, eventually leading to significant improvements in sampling speed, (4) Entity conditional generation: the first implementation of conditional generation of multi-sequence time series tabular data with heterogenous features in the literature, enabling scenario exploration across multiple scientific and engineering domains.

We introduce Deceptive-NeRF/3DGS to enhance sparse-view reconstruction with only a limited set of input images, by leveraging a diffusion model pre-trained from multiview datasets. Different from using diffusion priors to regularize representation optimization, our method directly uses diffusion-generated images to train NeRF/3DGS as if they were real input views. Specifically, we propose a deceptive diffusion model turning noisy images rendered from few-view reconstructions into high-quality photorealistic pseudo-observations. To resolve consistency among pseudo-observations and real input views, we develop an uncertainty measure to guide the diffusion model's generation. Our system progressively incorporates diffusion-generated pseudo-observations into the training image sets, ultimately densifying the sparse input observations by 5 to 10 times. Extensive experiments across diverse and challenging datasets validate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is capable of synthesizing novel views with super-resolution in the few-view setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[Removing Undesirable Concepts in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Learnable Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12326v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable capability in generating visually impressive content from textual descriptions. However, these models are trained on vast internet data, much of which contains undesirable elements such as sensitive content, copyrighted material, and unethical or harmful concepts. Therefore, beyond generating high-quality content, it is crucial to ensure these models do not propagate these undesirable elements. To address this issue, we propose a novel method to remove undesirable concepts from text-to-image diffusion models by incorporating a learnable prompt into the cross-attention module. This learnable prompt acts as additional memory, capturing the knowledge of undesirable concepts and reducing their dependency on the model parameters and corresponding textual inputs. By transferring this knowledge to the prompt, erasing undesirable concepts becomes more stable and has minimal negative impact on other concepts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the Stable Diffusion model, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art erasure methods in removing undesirable content while preserving unrelated elements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mutual Learning for Acoustic Matching and Dereverberation via Visual Scene-driven Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10373v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual acoustic matching (VAM) is pivotal for enhancing the immersive experience, and the task of dereverberation is effective in improving audio intelligibility. Existing methods treat each task independently, overlooking the inherent reciprocity between them. Moreover, these methods depend on paired training data, which is challenging to acquire, impeding the utilization of extensive unpaired data. In this paper, we introduce MVSD, a mutual learning framework based on diffusion models. MVSD considers the two tasks symmetrically, exploiting the reciprocal relationship to facilitate learning from inverse tasks and overcome data scarcity. Furthermore, we employ the diffusion model as foundational conditional converters to circumvent the training instability and over-smoothing drawbacks of conventional GAN architectures. Specifically, MVSD employs two converters: one for VAM called reverberator and one for dereverberation called dereverberator. The dereverberator judges whether the reverberation audio generated by reverberator sounds like being in the conditional visual scenario, and vice versa. By forming a closed loop, these two converters can generate informative feedback signals to optimize the inverse tasks, even with easily acquired one-way unpaired data. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, i.e., SoundSpaces-Speech and Acoustic AVSpeech, exhibit that our framework can improve the performance of the reverberator and dereverberator and better match specified visual scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024; Project page: https://hechang25.github.io/MVSD</p></details> |

In this work, we address the challenging problem of generating synchronized object motion and human motion guided by language descriptions in 3D scenes. We propose Controllable Human-Object Interaction Synthesis (CHOIS), an approach that generates object motion and human motion simultaneously using a conditional diffusion model given a language description, initial object and human states, and sparse object waypoints. Here, language descriptions inform style and intent, and waypoints, which can be effectively extracted from high-level planning, ground the motion in the scene. Naively applying a diffusion model fails to predict object motion aligned with the input waypoints; it also cannot ensure the realism of interactions that require precise hand-object and human-floor contact. To overcome these problems, we introduce an object geometry loss as additional supervision to improve the matching between generated object motion and input object waypoints; we also design guidance terms to enforce contact constraints during the sampling process of the trained diffusion model. We demonstrate that our learned interaction module can synthesize realistic human-object interactions, adhering to provided textual descriptions and sparse waypoint conditions. Additionally, our module seamlessly integrates with a path planning module, enabling the generation of long-term interactions in 3D environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024, project webpage: https://lijiaman.github.io/projects/chois/</p></details> |

The effectiveness of existing ML-based approaches in this context is largely limited by the scarcity of data, as the production of real semiconductor wafer data for training these models involves high financial and time costs. Moreover, the existing simulation methods fall short of replicating images with identical noise characteristics, surface roughness and stochastic variations at advanced nodes. We propose a method for generating synthetic semiconductor SEM images using a diffusion model within a limited data regime. In contrast to images generated through conventional simulation methods, SEM images generated through our proposed DL method closely resemble real SEM images, replicating their noise characteristics and surface roughness adaptively. Our main contributions, which are validated on three different real semiconductor datasets, are: i) proposing a patch-based generative framework utilizing DDPM to create SEM images with intended defect classes, addressing challenges related to class-imbalance and data insufficiency, ii) demonstrating generated synthetic images closely resemble real SEM images acquired from the tool, preserving all imaging conditions and metrology characteristics without any metadata supervision, iii) demonstrating a defect detector trained on generated defect dataset, either independently or combined with a limited real dataset, can achieve similar or improved performance on real wafer SEM images during validation/testing compared to exclusive training on a real defect dataset, iv) demonstrating the ability of the proposed approach to transfer defect types, critical dimensions, and imaging conditions from one specified CD/Pitch and metrology specifications to another, thereby highlighting its versatility.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures, to be presented at 2024 International Symposium ELMAR, and published by IEEE in the conference proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Text-Anchored Score Composition: Tackling Condition Misalignment in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14408v3)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have advanced towards more controllable generation via supporting various additional conditions (e.g.,depth map, bounding box) beyond text. However, these models are learned based on the premise of perfect alignment between the text and extra conditions. If this alignment is not satisfied, the final output could be either dominated by one condition, or ambiguity may arise, failing to meet user expectations. To address this issue, we present a training free approach called Text-Anchored Score Composition (TASC) to further improve the controllability of existing models when provided with partially aligned conditions. The TASC firstly separates conditions based on pair relationships, computing the result individually for each pair. This ensures that each pair no longer has conflicting conditions. Then we propose an attention realignment operation to realign these independently calculated results via a cross-attention mechanism to avoid new conflicts when combining them back. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling unaligned conditions, which performs favorably against recent methods and more importantly adds flexibility to the controllable image generation process.

However, generating high-resolution images with diffusion models is still challenging due to the enormous computational costs, resulting in a prohibitive latency for interactive applications. In this paper, we propose DistriFusion to tackle this problem by leveraging parallelism across multiple GPUs. Our method splits the model input into multiple patches and assigns each patch to a GPU. However, naively implementing such an algorithm breaks the interaction between patches and loses fidelity, while incorporating such an interaction will incur tremendous communication overhead. To overcome this dilemma, we observe the high similarity between the input from adjacent diffusion steps and propose displaced patch parallelism, which takes advantage of the sequential nature of the diffusion process by reusing the pre-computed feature maps from the previous timestep to provide context for the current step. Therefore, our method supports asynchronous communication, which can be pipelined by computation. Extensive experiments show that our method can be applied to recent Stable Diffusion XL with no quality degradation and achieve up to a 6.1$\times$ speedup on eight NVIDIA A100s compared to one.

Our method distills the scores of two tree-adapted diffusion models by utilizing text prompts to specify a tree genus, thus facilitating shape reconstruction. This process involves reconstructing a 3D tree envelope filled with point markers, which are subsequently utilized to estimate the tree's branching structure using the space colonization algorithm conditioned on a specified genus.</p></details> | Accepted to ECCV24 |

As AI-generated media, including video, audio and text, become more realistic, the risk of misuse to spread misinformation and commit identity fraud increases. Focused on face-centric deepfakes, this work traces the evolution from traditional single-modality methods to sophisticated multi-modal approaches that handle audio-visual and text-visual scenarios. We provide comprehensive taxonomies of detection techniques, discuss the evolution of generative methods from auto-encoders and GANs to diffusion models, and categorize these technologies by their unique attributes. To our knowledge, this is the first survey of its kind. We also explore the challenges of adapting detection methods to new generative models and enhancing the reliability and robustness of deepfake detectors, proposing directions for future research.

Despite the significant training costs, maintaining consistency of content between the original and enhanced videos remains a major challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel formulation that considers both visual quality and consistency of content. Consistency of content is ensured by a proposed loss function that maintains the structure of the input, while visual quality is improved by utilizing the denoising process of pretrained diffusion models. To address the formulated optimization problem, we have developed a plug-and-play noise optimization strategy, referred to as Noise Calibration. By refining the initial random noise through a few iterations, the content of original video can be largely preserved, and the enhancement effect demonstrates a notable improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024, Project Page: https://yangqy1110.github.io/NC-SDEdit/, Code Repo: https://github.com/yangqy1110/NC-SDEdit/</p></details> |
| **[Disrupting Diffusion-based Inpainters with Semantic Digression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10277v1)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fabrication of visual misinformation on the web and social media has increased exponentially with the advent of foundational text-to-image diffusion models. Namely, Stable Diffusion inpainters allow the synthesis of maliciously inpainted images of personal and private figures, and copyrighted contents, also known as deepfakes. To combat such generations, a disruption framework, namely Photoguard, has been proposed, where it adds adversarial noise to the context image to disrupt their inpainting synthesis. While their framework suggested a diffusion-friendly approach, the disruption is not sufficiently strong and it requires a significant amount of GPU and time to immunize the context image. In our work, we re-examine both the minimal and favorable conditions for a successful inpainting disruption, proposing DDD, a "Digression guided Diffusion Disruption" framework. First, we identify the most adversarially vulnerable diffusion timestep range with respect to the hidden space. Within this scope of noised manifold, we pose the problem as a semantic digression optimization. We maximize the distance between the inpainting instance's hidden states and a semantic-aware hidden state centroid, calibrated both by Monte Carlo sampling of hidden states and a discretely projected optimization in the token space. Effectively, our approach achieves stronger disruption and a higher success rate than Photoguard while lowering the GPU memory requirement, and speeding the optimization up to three times faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures, IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis in Denoising: Towards Semantic-Driven Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08872v3)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models allow users control over the content of generated images. Still, text-to-image generation occasionally leads to generation failure requiring users to generate dozens of images under the same text prompt before they obtain a satisfying result. We formulate the lottery ticket hypothesis in denoising: randomly initialized Gaussian noise images contain special pixel blocks (winning tickets) that naturally tend to be denoised into specific content independently. The generation failure in standard text-to-image synthesis is caused by the gap between optimal and actual spatial distribution of winning tickets in initial noisy images. To this end, we implement semantic-driven initial image construction creating initial noise from known winning tickets for each concept mentioned in the prompt. We conduct a series of experiments that verify the properties of winning tickets and demonstrate their generalizability across images and prompts. Our results show that aggregating winning tickets into the initial noise image effectively induce the model to generate the specified object at the corresponding location.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 Accepted |

Our method first renders a collection of images by using the 3DGS and edits them by using a pre-trained 2D diffusion model (ControlNet) based on the input prompt, which is then used to optimise the 3D model. Our key contribution is multi-view consistent editing, which enables editing all images together instead of iteratively editing one image while updating the 3D model as in previous works. It leads to faster editing as well as higher visual quality. This is achieved by the two terms: (a) depth-conditioned editing that enforces geometric consistency across multi-view images by leveraging naturally consistent depth maps. (b) attention-based latent code alignment that unifies the appearance of edited images by conditioning their editing to several reference views through self and cross-view attention between images' latent representations. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster editing and better visual results than previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024, Project Website: https://gaussctrl.active.vision/</p></details> |

Conventional methods construct a text-conditioned 3D scene through a three-stage process, involving pose estimation using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) libraries like COLMAP, initializing the 3D model with unedited images, and iteratively updating the dataset with edited images to achieve a 3D scene with text fidelity. Our framework streamlines the conventional multi-stage 3D editing process into a single-stage workflow by overcoming the reliance on COLMAP and eliminating the cost of model initialization. We apply a diffusion model to edit video frames prior to 3D scene creation by incorporating our designed noise blender module for enhancing multi-view editing consistency, a step that does not require additional training or fine-tuning of T2I diffusion models. 3DEgo utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to create 3D scenes from the multi-view consistent edited frames, capitalizing on the inherent temporal continuity and explicit point cloud data. 3DEgo demonstrates remarkable editing precision, speed, and adaptability across a variety of video sources, as validated by extensive evaluations on six datasets, including our own prepared GS25 dataset.

| **[A Watermark-Conditioned Diffusion Model for IP Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10893v2)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ethical need to protect AI-generated content has been a significant concern in recent years. While existing watermarking strategies have demonstrated success in detecting synthetic content (detection), there has been limited exploration in identifying the users responsible for generating these outputs from a single model (owner identification). In this paper, we focus on both practical scenarios and propose a unified watermarking framework for content copyright protection within the context of diffusion models. Specifically, we consider two parties: the model provider, who grants public access to a diffusion model via an API, and the users, who can solely query the model API and generate images in a black-box manner. Our task is to embed hidden information into the generated contents, which facilitates further detection and owner identification. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Watermark-conditioned Diffusion model called WaDiff, which manipulates the watermark as a conditioned input and incorporates fingerprinting into the generation process. All the generative outputs from our WaDiff carry user-specific information, which can be recovered by an image extractor and further facilitate forensic identification. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular diffusion models, and we demonstrate that our method is effective and robust in both the detection and owner identification tasks. Meanwhile, our watermarking framework only exerts a negligible impact on the original generation and is more stealthy and efficient in comparison to existing watermarking strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffBP: Generative Diffusion of 3D Molecules for Target Protein Binding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11214v4)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecules that bind to specific proteins is an important but challenging task in drug discovery. Previous works usually generate atoms in an auto-regressive way, where element types and 3D coordinates of atoms are generated one by one. However, in real-world molecular systems, the interactions among atoms in an entire molecule are global, leading to the energy function pair-coupled among atoms. With such energy-based consideration, the modeling of probability should be based on joint distributions, rather than sequentially conditional ones. Thus, the unnatural sequentially auto-regressive modeling of molecule generation is likely to violate the physical rules, thus resulting in poor properties of the generated molecules. In this work, a generative diffusion model for molecular 3D structures based on target proteins as contextual constraints is established, at a full-atom level in a non-autoregressive way. Given a designated 3D protein binding site, our model learns the generative process that denoises both element types and 3D coordinates of an entire molecule, with an equivariant network. Experimentally, the proposed method shows competitive performance compared with prevailing works in terms of high affinity with proteins and appropriate molecule sizes as well as other drug properties such as drug-likeness of the generated molecules.</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, their robustness against adversarial attacks has not been thoroughly explored. Existing attack methods primarily focus on white-box scenarios and struggle to transfer to recently proposed 3D deep-learning models. Even worse, these attacks introduce perturbations to 3D coordinates, generating unrealistic adversarial examples and resulting in poor performance against 3D adversarial defenses. In this paper, we generate high-quality adversarial point clouds using diffusion models. By using partial points as prior knowledge, we generate realistic adversarial examples through shape completion with adversarial guidance. The proposed adversarial shape completion allows for a more reliable generation of adversarial point clouds. To enhance attack transferability, we delve into the characteristics of 3D point clouds and employ model uncertainty for better inference of model classification through random down-sampling of point clouds. We adopt ensemble adversarial guidance for improved transferability across different network architectures. To maintain the generation quality, we limit our adversarial guidance solely to the critical points of the point clouds by calculating saliency scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods against both black-box models and defenses. Our black-box attack establishes a new baseline for evaluating the robustness of various 3D point cloud classification models.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

They pose severe security problems for deep learning applications because they can effectively bypass defense mechanisms. However, previous attack methods often directly inject Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) gradients into the sampling of generative models, which are not theoretically provable and thus generate unrealistic examples by incorporating adversarial objectives, especially for GAN-based methods on large-scale datasets like ImageNet. In this paper, we propose a new method, called AdvDiff, to generate unrestricted adversarial examples with diffusion models. We design two novel adversarial guidance techniques to conduct adversarial sampling in the reverse generation process of diffusion models. These two techniques are effective and stable in generating high-quality, realistic adversarial examples by integrating gradients of the target classifier interpretably. Experimental results on MNIST and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that AdvDiff is effective in generating unrestricted adversarial examples, which outperforms state-of-the-art unrestricted adversarial attack methods in terms of attack performance and generation quality.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[Free-Editor: Zero-shot Text-driven 3D Scene Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13663v2)** | 2024-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have recently gained traction for their versatility and user-friendliness in 2D content generation and editing. However, training a diffusion model specifically for 3D scene editing is challenging due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets. Currently, editing 3D scenes necessitates either retraining the model to accommodate various 3D edits or developing specific methods tailored to each unique editing type. Moreover, state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques require multiple synchronized edited images from the same scene to enable effective scene editing. Given the current limitations of T2I models, achieving consistent editing effects across multiple images remains difficult, leading to multi-view inconsistency in editing. This inconsistency undermines the performance of 3D scene editing when these images are utilized. In this study, we introduce a novel, training-free 3D scene editing technique called \textsc{Free-Editor}, which enables users to edit 3D scenes without the need for model retraining during the testing phase. Our method effectively addresses the issue of multi-view style inconsistency found in state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods through the implementation of a single-view editing scheme. Specifically, we demonstrate that editing a particular 3D scene can be achieved by modifying only a single view. To facilitate this, we present an Edit Transformer that ensures intra-view consistency and inter-view style transfer using self-view and cross-view attention mechanisms, respectively. By eliminating the need for model retraining and multi-view editing, our approach significantly reduces editing time and memory resource requirements, achieving runtimes approximately 20 times faster than SOTA methods. We have performed extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, showcasing the diverse editing capabilities of our proposed technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

This enables semantic communications at extremely low data rates in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop a latency-aware semantic communications framework with pre-trained generative models. The transmitter performs multi-modal semantic decomposition on the input signal and transmits each semantic stream with the appropriate coding and communication schemes based on the intent. For the prompt, we adopt a re-transmission-based scheme to ensure reliable transmission, and for the other semantic modalities we use an adaptive modulation/coding scheme to achieve robustness to the changing wireless channel. Furthermore, we design a semantic and latency-aware scheme to allocate transmission power to different semantic modalities based on their importance subjected to semantic quality constraints. At the receiver, a pre-trained generative model synthesizes a high fidelity signal using the received multi-stream semantics. Simulation results demonstrate ultra-low-rate, low-latency, and channel-adaptive semantic communications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Wireless Communication Letters</p></details> |

Despite these developments, a prevalent limitation arises from the use of RGB data in diffusion or reconstruction models, which often results in models with inherent lighting and shadows effects that detract from their realism, thereby limiting their usability in applications that demand accurate relighting capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present UniDream, a text-to-3D generation framework by incorporating unified diffusion priors. Our approach consists of three main components: (1) a dual-phase training process to get albedo-normal aligned multi-view diffusion and reconstruction models, (2) a progressive generation procedure for geometry and albedo-textures based on Score Distillation Sample (SDS) using the trained reconstruction and diffusion models, and (3) an innovative application of SDS for finalizing PBR generation while keeping a fixed albedo based on Stable Diffusion model. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniDream surpasses existing methods in generating 3D objects with clearer albedo textures, smoother surfaces, enhanced realism, and superior relighting capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce \textsc{LatentEditor}, an innovative framework designed to empower users with the ability to perform precise and locally controlled editing of neural fields using text prompts. Leveraging denoising diffusion models, we successfully embed real-world scenes into the latent space, resulting in a faster and more adaptable NeRF backbone for editing compared to traditional methods. To enhance editing precision, we introduce a delta score to calculate the 2D mask in the latent space that serves as a guide for local modifications while preserving irrelevant regions. Our novel pixel-level scoring approach harnesses the power of InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) to discern the disparity between IP2P conditional and unconditional noise predictions in the latent space. The edited latents conditioned on the 2D masks are then iteratively updated in the training set to achieve 3D local editing. Our approach achieves faster editing speeds and superior output quality compared to existing 3D editing models, bridging the gap between textual instructions and high-quality 3D scene editing in latent space. We show the superiority of our approach on four benchmark 3D datasets, LLFF, IN2N, NeRFStudio and NeRF-Art.

Although these methods can successfully synthesize from views similar to training camera trajectory, directing the novel view outside the training camera distribution does not guarantee on-par performance. In this paper, we tackle the Extrapolated View Synthesis (EVS) problem by evaluating the reconstructions on views such as looking left, right or downwards with respect to training camera distributions. To improve rendering quality for EVS, we initialize our model by constructing dense LiDAR map, and propose to leverage prior scene knowledge such as surface normal estimator and large-scale diffusion model. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on EVS. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the EVS problem in urban scene reconstruction.

While significant strides have been made in dexterous grasp generation, current research endeavors pivot towards optimizing object manipulation while ensuring functional integrity, emphasizing the synthesis of functional grasps following desired affordance instructions. This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing functional grasps tailored to diverse dexterous robotic hands by proposing DexGrasp-Diffusion, an end-to-end modularized diffusion-based pipeline. DexGrasp-Diffusion integrates MultiHandDiffuser, a novel unified data-driven diffusion model for multi-dexterous hands grasp estimation, with DexDiscriminator, which employs a Physics Discriminator and a Functional Discriminator with open-vocabulary setting to filter physically plausible functional grasps based on object affordances. The experimental evaluation conducted on the MultiDex dataset provides substantiating evidence supporting the superior performance of MultiHandDiffuser over the baseline model in terms of success rate, grasp diversity, and collision depth. Moreover, we demonstrate the capacity of DexGrasp-Diffusion to reliably generate functional grasps for household objects aligned with specific affordance instructions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Image Compression with Diffusion-Based Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09896v1)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models dominate the field of image generation, however they have yet to make major breakthroughs in the field of image compression. Indeed, while pre-trained diffusion models have been successfully adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks, existing work in diffusion-based image compression require task specific model training, which can be both cumbersome and limiting. This work addresses this gap by harnessing the image prior learned by existing pre-trained diffusion models for solving the task of lossy image compression. This enables the use of the wide variety of publicly-available models, and avoids the need for training or fine-tuning. Our method, PSC (Posterior Sampling-based Compression), utilizes zero-shot diffusion-based posterior samplers. It does so through a novel sequential process inspired by the active acquisition technique "Adasense" to accumulate informative measurements of the image. This strategy minimizes uncertainty in the reconstructed image and allows for construction of an image-adaptive transform coordinated between both the encoder and decoder. PSC offers a progressive compression scheme that is both practical and simple to implement. Despite minimal tuning, and a simple quantization and entropy coding, PSC achieves competitive results compared to established methods, paving the way for further exploration of pre-trained diffusion models and posterior samplers for image compression.</p></details> |  |

Existing 3D-aware image editing approaches typically rely on synthetic multi-view datasets for training specialized models, thus constraining their effectiveness on open-domain images featuring significantly more varied layouts and styles. In contrast, our method directly leverages powerful image diffusion models trained on a broad spectrum of text-image pairs and thus retain their exceptional generalization abilities. This objective is realized through the development of an iterative novel view synthesis and geometry alignment algorithm. The algorithm harnesses diffusion models for dual purposes: they provide appearance prior by predicting novel views of the selected object using estimated depth maps, and they act as a geometry critic by correcting misalignments in 3D shapes across the sampled views. Our method can generate high-quality 3D-aware image edits with large viewpoint transformations and high appearance and shape consistency with the input image, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with single-image 3D-aware editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wangrc.site/Diff3DEdit/</p></details> |

The success of diffusion models for image synthesis has led to the use of these models for motion synthesis. However, the majority of these motion diffusion models are primarily designed for offline applications, where space-time models are used to synthesize an entire sequence of frames simultaneously with a pre-specified length. To enable real-time motion synthesis with diffusion model that allows time-varying controls, we propose A-MDM (Auto-regressive Motion Diffusion Model). Our conditional diffusion model takes an initial pose as input, and auto-regressively generates successive motion frames conditioned on the previous frame. Despite its streamlined network architecture, which uses simple MLPs, our framework is capable of generating diverse, long-horizon, and high-fidelity motion sequences. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of techniques for incorporating interactive controls into A-MDM, such as task-oriented sampling, in-painting, and hierarchical reinforcement learning. These techniques enable a pre-trained A-MDM to be efficiently adapted for a variety of new downstream tasks. We conduct a comprehensive suite of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of A-MDM, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art auto-regressive methods.</p></details> |  |

Posterior sampling from the conditional score function enable the precious data consistency certified by the measurement-based likelihood term. However, most prevailing approaches confined to the deterministic deterioration process of the measurement model, regardless of capricious unpredictable disturbance in real-world sceneries. To address this obstacle, we show that the measurement-based likelihood can be renovated with restoration-based likelihood via the opposite probabilistic graphic direction, licencing the patronage of various off-the-shelf restoration models and extending the strictly deterministic deterioration process to adaptable clustered processes with the supposed prototype, in what we call restorer guidance. Particularly, assembled with versatile prototypes optionally, we can resolve inverse problems with bunch of choices for assorted sample quality and realize the proficient deterioration control with assured realistic. We show that our work can be formally analogous to the transition from classifier guidance to classifier-free guidance in the field of inverse problem solver. Experiments on multifarious inverse problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, including image dehazing, rain streak removal, and motion deblurring.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

However, as is common with many Deep Learning (DL) models, DMs are subject to a lack of robustness. While there are attempts to evaluate the robustness of T2I DMs as a binary or worst-case problem, they cannot answer how robust in general the model is whenever an adversarial example (AE) can be found. In this study, we first introduce a probabilistic notion of T2I DMs' robustness; and then establish an efficient framework, ProTIP, to evaluate it with statistical guarantees. The main challenges stem from: i) the high computational cost of the generation process; and ii) determining if a perturbed input is an AE involves comparing two output distributions, which is fundamentally harder compared to other DL tasks like classification where an AE is identified upon misprediction of labels. To tackle the challenges, we employ sequential analysis with efficacy and futility early stopping rules in the statistical testing for identifying AEs, and adaptive concentration inequalities to dynamically determine the "just-right" number of stochastic perturbations whenever the verification target is met. Empirical experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ProTIP over common T2I DMs. Finally, we demonstrate an application of ProTIP to rank commonly used defence methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV24 |

With the challenges in poor soft tissue contrast and a scarcity of well-annotated databases for clinical brain CTs, we introduce a novel uncertainty-aware ventricle segmentation technique without the need of CT segmentation ground truths by leveraging diffusion-model-based domain adaptation. Specifically, our method employs the diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge and an attention recurrent residual U-Net to capitalize on unpaired CT and MRI scans to derive automatic CT segmentation from those of the MRIs, which are more accessible. Importantly, we propose an end-to-end, joint training framework of image translation and segmentation tasks, and demonstrate its benefit over training individual tasks separately. By comparing the proposed method against similar setups using two different GAN models for domain adaptation (CycleGAN and CUT), we also reveal the advantage of diffusion models towards improved segmentation and image translation quality. With a Dice score of 0.78$\pm$0.27, our proposed method outperformed the compared methods, including SynSeg-Net, while providing intuitive uncertainty measures to further facilitate quality control of the automatic segmentation outcomes.

To ensure a safe deployment of such systems, it is crucial to accurately evaluate and improve their anomaly segmentation capabilities. However, acquiring and labelling semantic segmentation data is expensive and unanticipated conditions are long-tail and potentially hazardous. Indeed, existing anomaly segmentation datasets capture a limited number of anomalies, lack realism or have strong domain shifts. In this paper, we propose the Placing Objects in Context (POC) pipeline to realistically add any object into any image via diffusion models. POC can be used to easily extend any dataset with an arbitrary number of objects. In our experiments, we present different anomaly segmentation datasets based on POC-generated data and show that POC can improve the performance of recent state-of-the-art anomaly fine-tuning methods across several standardized benchmarks. POC is also effective for learning new classes. For example, we utilize it to augment Cityscapes samples by incorporating a subset of Pascal classes and demonstrate that models trained on such data achieve comparable performance to the Pascal-trained baseline. This corroborates the low synth2real gap of models trained on POC-generated images.

However, most existing image translation methods treat infrared images as a stylistic variation, neglecting the underlying physical laws, which limits their practical application. To address these issues, we propose a Physics-Informed Diffusion (PID) model for translating RGB images to infrared images that adhere to physical laws. Our method leverages the iterative optimization of the diffusion model and incorporates strong physical constraints based on prior knowledge of infrared laws during training. This approach enhances the similarity between translated infrared images and the real infrared domain without increasing extra training parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that PID significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/fangyuanmao/PID.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion-Guided Latent Diffusion for Temporally Consistent Real-world Video Super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00853v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world low-resolution (LR) videos have diverse and complex degradations, imposing great challenges on video super-resolution (VSR) algorithms to reproduce their high-resolution (HR) counterparts with high quality. Recently, the diffusion models have shown compelling performance in generating realistic details for image restoration tasks. However, the diffusion process has randomness, making it hard to control the contents of restored images. This issue becomes more serious when applying diffusion models to VSR tasks because temporal consistency is crucial to the perceptual quality of videos. In this paper, we propose an effective real-world VSR algorithm by leveraging the strength of pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure the content consistency among adjacent frames, we exploit the temporal dynamics in LR videos to guide the diffusion process by optimizing the latent sampling path with a motion-guided loss, ensuring that the generated HR video maintains a coherent and continuous visual flow. To further mitigate the discontinuity of generated details, we insert temporal module to the decoder and fine-tune it with an innovative sequence-oriented loss. The proposed motion-guided latent diffusion (MGLD) based VSR algorithm achieves significantly better perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneActor: Consistent Character Generation via Cluster-Conditioned Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10267v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models benefit artists with high-quality image generation. Yet their stochastic nature hinders artists from creating consistent images of the same subject. Existing methods try to tackle this challenge and generate consistent content in various ways. However, they either depend on external restricted data or require expensive tuning of the diffusion model. For this issue, we propose a novel one-shot tuning paradigm, termed as OneActor. It efficiently performs consistent subject generation solely driven by prompts via a learned semantic guidance to bypass the laborious backbone tuning. We lead the way to formalize the objective of consistent subject generation from a clustering perspective, and thus design a cluster-conditioned model. To mitigate the overfitting challenge shared by one-shot tuning pipelines, we augment the tuning with auxiliary samples and devise two inference strategies: semantic interpolation and cluster guidance. These techniques are later verified to significantly enhance the generation quality. Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms a variety of baselines with satisfactory subject consistency, superior prompt conformity as well as high image quality. Our method is capable of multi-subject generation and compatible with popular diffusion extensions. Besides, we achieve a 4 times faster tuning speed than tuning-based baselines and, if desired, avoid increasing inference time. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, we are the first to prove that the semantic space of the diffusion model has the same interpolation property as the latent space does. This property can serve as another promising tool for fine generation control.</p></details> |  |

Each landmark is a single ground truth point labelled by a clinician. A machine learning model predicts the locus of a landmark as a probability region represented by a heatmap. Diffusion models have increased in popularity for generative modelling due to their high quality sampling and mode coverage, leading to their adoption in medical image processing for semantic segmentation. Diffusion modelling can be further adapted to learn a distribution over landmarks. The stochastic nature of diffusion models captures fluctuations in the landmark prediction, which we leverage by blurring into meaningful probability regions. In this paper, we reformulate automatic Anatomical Landmark Detection as a precise generative modelling task, producing a few-hot pixel heatmap. Our method achieves state-of-the-art MRE and comparable SDR performance with existing work.</p></details> |  |

Without directly comparable methods in 3D medical imaging, we benchmarked GenerateCT against cutting-edge methods, demonstrating its superiority across all key metrics. Importantly, we evaluated GenerateCT's clinical applications in a multi-abnormality classification task. First, we established a baseline by training a multi-abnormality classifier on our real dataset. To further assess the model's generalization to external data and performance with unseen prompts in a zero-shot scenario, we employed an external set to train the classifier, setting an additional benchmark. We conducted two experiments in which we doubled the training datasets by synthesizing an equal number of volumes for each set using GenerateCT. The first experiment demonstrated an 11% improvement in the AP score when training the classifier jointly on real and generated volumes. The second experiment showed a 7% improvement when training on both real and generated volumes based on unseen prompts. Moreover, GenerateCT enables the scaling of synthetic training datasets to arbitrary sizes. As an example, we generated 100,000 3D CTs, fivefold the number in our real set, and trained the classifier exclusively on these synthetic CTs. Impressively, this classifier surpassed the performance of the one trained on all available real data by a margin of 8%. Last, domain experts evaluated the generated volumes, confirming a high degree of alignment with the text prompt.

The common theme is the use of diffusion-based image generation networks that are specialized for each particular task, followed by a 3D lifting network. We purposefully decouple the generation from the 3D modeling which allow us to leverage powerful image synthesis priors, trained on billions of text-image pairs. We fine-tune latent diffusion networks with additional image conditioning for image generation and back-view prediction, and to support qualitatively different multiple 3D hypotheses. Our partial fine-tuning approach allows to adapt the networks for each task without inducing catastrophic forgetting. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method produces accurate, high-quality 3D avatars with diverse appearance that respect the multimodal text, image, and body control signals. Our approach can produce a 3D model in as few as 2 seconds, a four orders of magnitude speedup wrt the vast majority of existing methods, most of which solve only a subset of our tasks, and with fewer controls. AvatarPopUp enables applications that require the controlled 3D generation of human avatars at scale.

Due to the distinct imaging paradigm shift, a dominant line of research focuses on event-to-video (E2V) reconstruction to bridge event-based and standard computer vision. However, this task remains challenging due to its inherently ill-posed nature: event cameras only detect the edge and motion information locally. Consequently, the reconstructed videos are often plagued by artifacts and regional blur, primarily caused by the ambiguous semantics of event data. In this paper, we find language naturally conveys abundant semantic information, rendering it stunningly superior in ensuring semantic consistency for E2V reconstruction. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework, called LaSe-E2V, that can achieve semantic-aware high-quality E2V reconstruction from a language-guided perspective, buttressed by the text-conditional diffusion models. However, due to diffusion models' inherent diversity and randomness, it is hardly possible to directly apply them to achieve spatial and temporal consistency for E2V reconstruction. Thus, we first propose an Event-guided Spatiotemporal Attention (ESA) module to condition the event data to the denoising pipeline effectively. We then introduce an event-aware mask loss to ensure temporal coherence and a noise initialization strategy to enhance spatial consistency. Given the absence of event-text-video paired data, we aggregate existing E2V datasets and generate textual descriptions using the tagging models for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on three datasets covering diverse challenging scenarios (e.g., fast motion, low light) demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.04324 by other authors</p></details> |

This strategy allows us to leverage abundant and diverse behavior data to enhance generalization and enable rapid adaptation to downstream tasks using minimal annotations. In particular, we introduce Efficient Diffusion Alignment (EDA) for solving continuous control problems. EDA utilizes diffusion models for behavior modeling. However, unlike previous approaches, we represent diffusion policies as the derivative of a scalar neural network with respect to action inputs. This representation is critical because it enables direct density calculation for diffusion models, making them compatible with existing LLM alignment theories. During policy fine-tuning, we extend preference-based alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align diffusion behaviors with continuous Q-functions. Our evaluation on the D4RL benchmark shows that EDA exceeds all baseline methods in overall performance. Notably, EDA maintains about 95\% of performance and still outperforms several baselines given only 1\% of Q-labelled data during fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Despite the promising results achieved by previous approaches, challenges persist in achieving temporally consistent animation and ensuring robustness with off-the-shelf pose detectors. In this paper, we present TCAN, a pose-driven human image animation method that is robust to erroneous poses and consistent over time. In contrast to previous methods, we utilize the pre-trained ControlNet without fine-tuning to leverage its extensive pre-acquired knowledge from numerous pose-image-caption pairs. To keep the ControlNet frozen, we adapt LoRA to the UNet layers, enabling the network to align the latent space between the pose and appearance features. Additionally, by introducing an additional temporal layer to the ControlNet, we enhance robustness against outliers of the pose detector. Through the analysis of attention maps over the temporal axis, we also designed a novel temperature map leveraging pose information, allowing for a more static background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve promising results in video synthesis tasks encompassing various poses, like chibi.

However, subtle style variations within different reference images can hinder the model from accurately learning the target style. In this paper, we propose InstaStyle, a novel approach that excels in generating high-fidelity stylized images with only a single reference image. Our approach is based on the finding that the inversion noise from a stylized reference image inherently carries the style signal, as evidenced by their non-zero signal-to-noise ratio. We employ DDIM inversion to extract this noise from the reference image and leverage a diffusion model to generate new stylized images from the "style" noise. Additionally, the inherent ambiguity and bias of textual prompts impede the precise conveying of style. To address this, we introduce a learnable style token via prompt refinement, which enhances the accuracy of the style description for the reference image. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that InstaStyle achieves superior performance compared to current benchmarks. Furthermore, our approach also showcases its capability in the creative task of style combination with mixed inversion noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2024).

In this paper, we revisit the diffusion sampling process and identify a fundamental cause of sample quality degradation: the denoiser is poorly estimated in regions that are far Outside Of the training Distribution (OOD), and the sampling process inevitably evaluates in these OOD regions. This can become problematic for all sampling methods, especially when we move to parallel sampling which requires us to initialize and update the entire sample trajectory of dynamics in parallel, leading to many OOD evaluations. To address this problem, we introduce a new self-supervised training objective that differentiates the levels of noise added to a sample, leading to improved OOD denoising performance. The approach is based on our observation that diffusion models implicitly define a log-likelihood ratio that distinguishes distributions with different amounts of noise, and this expression depends on denoiser performance outside the standard training distribution. We show by diverse experiments that the proposed contrastive diffusion training is effective for both sequential and parallel settings, and it improves the performance and speed of parallel samplers significantly.</p></details> |  |

It is fine-tuned through model alignment and instruction tuning using a newly established medical video corpus, which includes paired text-video data from various biomedical fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish such a comprehensive annotated biomedical video dataset. Bora is capable of generating high-quality video data across four distinct biomedical domains, adhering to medical expert standards and demonstrating consistency and diversity. This generalist video generative model holds significant potential for enhancing medical consultation and decision-making, particularly in resource-limited settings. Additionally, Bora could pave the way for immersive medical training and procedure planning. Extensive experiments on distinct medical modalities such as endoscopy, ultrasound, MRI, and cell tracking validate the effectiveness of our model in understanding biomedical instructions and its superior performance across subjects compared to state-of-the-art generation models.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a content-transfer decomposition network that performs Retinex decomposition within the latent space instead of image space as in previous approaches, enabling the encoded features of unpaired low-light and normal-light images to be decomposed into content-rich reflectance maps and content-free illumination maps. Subsequently, the reflectance map of the low-light image and the illumination map of the normal-light image are taken as input to the diffusion model for unsupervised restoration with the guidance of the low-light feature, where a self-constrained consistency loss is further proposed to eliminate the interference of normal-light content on the restored results to improve overall visual quality. Extensive experiments on publicly available real-world benchmarks show that the proposed LightenDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised competitors and is comparable to supervised methods while being more generalizable to various scenes.

While these models are highly adaptable to new tasks, scaling and evaluating their usage presents new challenges not addressed in previous frameworks. In particular, the ability of these models to produce useful outputs with little to no specialized training data ("zero-" or "few-shot" approaches), as well as the open-ended nature of their outputs, necessitate the development of new guidelines for robust reporting of clinical generative model research. In response to gaps in standards and best practices for the development of clinical AI tools identified by US Executive Order 141103 and several emerging national networks for clinical AI evaluation, we begin to formalize some of these guidelines by building on the original MI-CLAIM checklist. The new checklist, MI-CLAIM-GEN (Table 1), aims to address differences in training, evaluation, interpretability, and reproducibility of new generative models compared to non-generative ("predictive") AI models. This MI-CLAIM-GEN checklist also seeks to clarify cohort selection reporting with unstructured clinical data and adds additional items on alignment with ethical standards for clinical AI research.</p></details> |  |

Most of the T2V frameworks usually inherit from the T2I model and add extra-temporal layers of training to generate dynamic videos, which can be viewed as a fine-tuning task. However, the traditional 3D-Unet is a serial mode and the temporal layers follow the spatial layers, which will result in high GPU memory and training time consumption according to its serial feature flow. We believe that this serial mode will bring more training costs with the large diffusion model and massive datasets, which are not environmentally friendly and not suitable for the development of the T2V. Therefore, we propose a highly efficient spatial-temporal parallel training paradigm for T2V tasks, named Mobius. In our 3D-Unet, the temporal layers and spatial layers are parallel, which optimizes the feature flow and backpropagation. The Mobius will save 24% GPU memory and 12% training time, which can greatly improve the T2V fine-tuning task and provide a novel insight for the AIGC community. We will release our codes in the future.</p></details> | Technical report |

Second, capitalizing on the RGNV, we present a novel Reference-Guided State Distillation (RGSD) loss. When incorporated into the optimization-based image-to-3D pipeline, our method significantly improves 3D generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Using Diffusion Trend Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09578v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional anomaly detection techniques based on reconstruction via denoising diffusion model are widely used due to their ability to identify anomaly locations and shapes with high performance. However, there is a limitation in determining appropriate noise parameters that can degrade anomalies while preserving normal characteristics. Also, due to the volatility of the diffusion model, normal regions can fluctuate considerably during reconstruction, resulting in false detection. In this paper, we propose a method to detect anomalies by analysis of reconstruction trend depending on the degree of degradation, effectively solving the both problems of existing methods. The proposed method is validated on an open dataset for industrial anomaly detection, improving the performance of existing methods on a number of evaluation criteria. With the ease of combination with existing anomaly detection methods, it provides a tradeoff between computational cost and performance, allowing it high application potential in manufacturing industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Existing methods face the dilemma of image quality and watermark robustness. Watermarks with superior image quality usually have inferior robustness against attacks such as blurring and JPEG compression, while watermarks with superior robustness usually significantly damage image quality. This dilemma stems from the traditional paradigm where watermarks are injected and detected in pixel space, relying on pixel perturbation for watermark detection and resilience against attacks. In this paper, we highlight that an effective solution to the problem is to both inject and detect watermarks in the latent diffusion space, and propose Latent Watermark with a progressive training strategy. It weakens the direct connection between quality and robustness and thus alleviates their contradiction. We conduct evaluations on two datasets and against 10 watermark attacks. 6 metrics measure the image quality and watermark robustness. Results show that compared to the recently proposed methods such as StegaStamp, StableSignature, RoSteALS, and TreeRing, LW not only surpasses them in terms of robustness but also offers superior image quality.

However, incorporating UAVs into next-generation wireless communication systems poses significant challenges, particularly in sustaining high-rate and long-range secure communications against eavesdropping attacks. In this work, we consider a UAV swarm-enabled secure surveillance network system, where a UAV swarm forms a virtual antenna array to transmit sensitive surveillance data to a remote base station (RBS) via collaborative beamforming (CB) so as to resist mobile eavesdroppers. Specifically, we formulate an aerial secure communication and energy efficiency multi-objective optimization problem (ASCEE-MOP) to maximize the secrecy rate of the system and to minimize the flight energy consumption of the UAV swarm. To address the non-convex, NP-hard and dynamic ASCEE-MOP, we propose a generative diffusion model-enabled twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) method. Specifically, GDMTD3 leverages an innovative application of diffusion models to determine optimal excitation current weights and position decisions of UAVs. The diffusion models can better capture the complex dynamics and the trade-off of the ASCEE-MOP, thereby yielding promising solutions. Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with traditional deployment strategies and some other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) benchmarks. Moreover, performance analysis under various parameter settings of GDMTD3 and different numbers of UAVs verifies the robustness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Certain types of motion that accompany speech can provide this illustrative mode of communication. While Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies (AR/VR) have introduced tools for producing drawings with hand motions (air drawing), they typically require costly hardware and additional digital markers, thereby limiting their accessibility and portability. Furthermore, air drawing demands considerable skill to achieve aesthetic results. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of AirSketch, aimed at generating faithful and visually coherent sketches directly from hand motions, eliminating the need for complicated headsets or markers. We devise a simple augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure, enabling a controllable image diffusion model to learn to translate from highly noisy hand tracking images to clean, aesthetically pleasing sketches, while preserving the essential visual cues from the original tracking data. We present two air drawing datasets to study this problem. Our findings demonstrate that beyond producing photo-realistic images from precise spatial inputs, controllable image diffusion can effectively produce a refined, clear sketch from a noisy input. Our work serves as an initial step towards marker-less air drawing and reveals distinct applications of controllable diffusion models to AirSketch and AR/VR in general.</p></details> |  |

As these models are trained using large-scale unsupervised data, it has become crucial to adapt these models to specific downstream tasks. Adapting these models via supervised fine-tuning requires collecting target datasets of videos, which is challenging and tedious. In this work, we utilize pre-trained reward models that are learned via preferences on top of powerful vision discriminative models to adapt video diffusion models. These models contain dense gradient information with respect to generated RGB pixels, which is critical to efficient learning in complex search spaces, such as videos. We show that backpropagating gradients from these reward models to a video diffusion model can allow for compute and sample efficient alignment of the video diffusion model. We show results across a variety of reward models and video diffusion models, demonstrating that our approach can learn much more efficiently in terms of reward queries and computation than prior gradient-free approaches.

However, video streaming remains much less explored, despite a growing need for live video processing. State-of-the-art video diffusion models leverage bi-directional temporal attention to model the correlations between the current frame and all the surrounding (i.e. including future) frames, which hinders them from processing streaming videos. To address this problem, we present Live2Diff, the first attempt at designing a video diffusion model with uni-directional temporal attention, specifically targeting live streaming video translation. Compared to previous works, our approach ensures temporal consistency and smoothness by correlating the current frame with its predecessors and a few initial warmup frames, without any future frames. Additionally, we use a highly efficient denoising scheme featuring a KV-cache mechanism and pipelining, to facilitate streaming video translation at interactive framerates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attention mechanism and pipeline, outperforming previous methods in terms of temporal smoothness and/or efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://live2diff.github.io/</p></details> |

Our approach involves manipulating the distribution of training and generated data through a novel metric for individual samples, named pseudo density, which is based on the nearest-neighbor information from real samples. Our approach offers three distinct techniques to adjust the fidelity and diversity of deep generative models: 1) Per-sample perturbation, enabling precise adjustments for individual samples towards either more common or more unique characteristics; 2) Importance sampling during model inference to enhance either fidelity or diversity in the generated data; 3) Fine-tuning with importance sampling, which guides the generative model to learn an adjusted distribution, thus controlling fidelity and diversity. Furthermore, our fine-tuning method demonstrates the ability to improve the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for pre-trained generative models with minimal iterations.</p></details> |  |

This is different from previous methods which only can work on a specific motion domain or show weak control abilities with diffusion prior. To achieve our goal, we design several domain-aware motion field adapters (\ie, MOFA-Adapters) to control the generated motions in the video generation pipeline. For MOFA-Adapters, we consider the temporal motion consistency of the video and generate the dense motion flow from the given sparse control conditions first, and then, the multi-scale features of the given image are wrapped as a guided feature for stable video diffusion generation. We naively train two motion adapters for the manual trajectories and the human landmarks individually since they both contain sparse information about the control. After training, the MOFA-Adapters in different domains can also work together for more controllable video generation.

In particular, text-to-image diffusion models have garnered widespread adoption across diverse domain due to their potential for high-fidelity image generation. Nonetheless, existing large-scale diffusion models are confined to generate images of up to 1K resolution, which is far from meeting the demands of contemporary commercial applications. Directly sampling higher-resolution images often yields results marred by artifacts such as object repetition and distorted shapes. Addressing the aforementioned issues typically necessitates training or fine-tuning models on higher resolution datasets. However, this undertaking poses a formidable challenge due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale high-resolution contents and substantial computational resources. While several preceding works have proposed alternatives, they often fail to produce convincing results. In this work, we probe the generative ability of diffusion models at higher resolution beyond its original capability and propose a novel progressive approach that fully utilizes generated low-resolution image to guide the generation of higher resolution image. Our method obviates the need for additional training or fine-tuning which significantly lowers the burden of computational costs. Extensive experiments and results validate the efficiency and efficacy of our method. Project page: https://yhyun225.github.io/DiffuseHigh/</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Latent Diffusion Models for Training-Free In-Distribution Data Augmentation for Surface Defect Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03961v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defect detection is the task of identifying defects in production samples. Usually, defect detection classifiers are trained on ground-truth data formed by normal samples (negative data) and samples with defects (positive data), where the latter are consistently fewer than normal samples. State-of-the-art data augmentation procedures add synthetic defect data by superimposing artifacts to normal samples to mitigate problems related to unbalanced training data. These techniques often produce out-of-distribution images, resulting in systems that learn what is not a normal sample but cannot accurately identify what a defect looks like. In this work, we introduce DIAG, a training-free Diffusion-based In-distribution Anomaly Generation pipeline for data augmentation. Unlike conventional image generation techniques, we implement a human-in-the-loop pipeline, where domain experts provide multimodal guidance to the model through text descriptions and region localization of the possible anomalies. This strategic shift enhances the interpretability of results and fosters a more robust human feedback loop, facilitating iterative improvements of the generated outputs. Remarkably, our approach operates in a zero-shot manner, avoiding time-consuming fine-tuning procedures while achieving superior performance. We demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of DIAG with respect to state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches on the challenging KSDD2 dataset, with an improvement in AP of approximately 18% when positive samples are available and 28% when they are missing.

However, existing CTDG models encounter challenges stemming from noise and limited historical data. Graph Data Augmentation (GDA) emerges as a critical solution, yet current approaches primarily focus on static graphs and struggle to effectively address the dynamics inherent in CTDGs. Moreover, these methods often demand substantial domain expertise for parameter tuning and lack theoretical guarantees for augmentation efficacy. To address these issues, we propose Conda, a novel latent diffusion-based GDA method tailored for CTDGs. Conda features a sandwich-like architecture, incorporating a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and a conditional diffusion model, aimed at generating enhanced historical neighbor embeddings for target nodes. Unlike conventional diffusion models trained on entire graphs via pre-training, Conda requires historical neighbor sequence embeddings of target nodes for training, thus facilitating more targeted augmentation. We integrate Conda into the CTDG model and adopt an alternating training strategy to optimize performance. Extensive experimentation across six widely used real-world datasets showcases the consistent performance improvement of our approach, particularly in scenarios with limited historical data.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

In this work, we introduce MARS, a novel framework for T2I generation that incorporates a specially designed Semantic Vision-Language Integration Expert (SemVIE). This innovative component integrates pre-trained LLMs by independently processing linguistic and visual information, freezing the textual component while fine-tuning the visual component. This methodology preserves the NLP capabilities of LLMs while imbuing them with exceptional visual understanding. Building upon the powerful base of the pre-trained Qwen-7B, MARS stands out with its bilingual generative capabilities corresponding to both English and Chinese language prompts and the capacity for joint image and text generation. The flexibility of this framework lends itself to migration towards any-to-any task adaptability. Furthermore, MARS employs a multi-stage training strategy that first establishes robust image-text alignment through complementary bidirectional tasks and subsequently concentrates on refining the T2I generation process, significantly augmenting text-image synchrony and the granularity of image details. Notably, MARS requires only 9% of the GPU days needed by SD1.5, yet it achieves remarkable results across a variety of benchmarks, illustrating the training efficiency and the potential for swift deployment in various applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

To this end, we design an initial prompt learner to enable the diffusion model to recognize the tracking target by learning a prompt representing the target. Furthermore, to facilitate dynamic adaptation of the prompt to the target's movements, we propose an online prompt updater.

| **[Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03881v3)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning traditionally relies on increasingly larger datasets. Yet, such datasets pose major storage challenges and usually contain non-influential samples, which could be ignored during training without negatively impacting the training quality. In response, the idea of distilling a dataset into a condensed set of synthetic samples, i.e., a distilled dataset, emerged. One key aspect is the selected architecture, usually ConvNet, for linking the original and synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if the employed model architecture differs from that used during distillation. Another challenge is the generation of high-resolution images (128x128 and higher). To address both challenges, this paper proposes Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models (LD3M) that combine diffusion in latent space with dataset distillation. Our novel diffusion process is tailored for this task and significantly improves the gradient flow for distillation. By adjusting the number of diffusion steps, LD3M also offers a convenient way of controlling the trade-off between distillation speed and dataset quality. Overall, LD3M consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 4.8 p.p. and 4.2 p.p. for 1 and 10 images per class, respectively, and on several ImageNet subsets and high resolutions (128x128 and 256x256).</p></details> |  |

In TTA, performance, memory consumption, and time consumption are crucial considerations. A recent diffusion-based TTA approach for restoring corrupted images involves image-level updates. However, using pixel space diffusion significantly increases resource requirements compared to conventional model updating TTA approaches, revealing limitations as a TTA method. To address this, we propose a novel TTA method that leverages an image editing model based on a latent diffusion model (LDM) and fine-tunes it using our newly introduced corruption modeling scheme. This scheme enhances the robustness of the diffusion model against distribution shifts by creating (clean, corrupted) image pairs and fine-tuning the model to edit corrupted images into clean ones. Moreover, we introduce a distilled variant to accelerate the model for corruption editing using only 4 network function evaluations (NFEs). We extensively validated our method across various architectures and datasets including image and video domains. Our model achieves the best performance with a 100 times faster runtime than that of a diffusion-based baseline. Furthermore, it is three times faster than the previous model updating TTA method that utilizes data augmentation, making an image-level updating approach more feasible.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 Camera Ready</p></details> |

We propose AdaSense, a novel Adaptive CS approach that leverages zero-shot posterior sampling with pre-trained diffusion models. By sequentially sampling from the posterior distribution, we can quantify the uncertainty of each possible future linear measurement throughout the acquisition process. AdaSense eliminates the need for additional training and boasts seamless adaptation to diverse domains with minimal tuning requirements. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaSense in reconstructing facial images from a small number of measurements. Furthermore, we apply AdaSense for active acquisition of medical images in the domains of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), highlighting its potential for tangible real-world acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2024</p></details> |

Furthermore, model personalization techniques might affect the detection capabilities of existing methods. In this work, we utilize the architectural properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to develop a new detection method. Our method can detect images from a known generative model and enable us to establish relationships between fine-tuned generative models. We tested the method on images produced by both Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and recent large text-to-image models (LTIMs) that rely on Diffusion Models.

Integrating events into intensities poses a highly ill-posed challenge, marred by initial condition ambiguities. Traditional regression-based deep learning methods fall short in perceptual quality, offering deterministic and often unrealistic reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce diffusion models to events-to-video reconstruction, achieving colorful, realistic, and perceptually superior video generation from achromatic events. Powered by the image generation ability and knowledge of pretrained diffusion models, the proposed method can achieve a better trade-off between the perception and distortion of the reconstructed frame compared to previous solutions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can produce diverse, realistic frames with faithfulness to the given events.</p></details> |  |

As vision language models (VLMs) advance in multimodal understanding and code generation, VLM-based agents could potentially automate these workflows by generating SQL queries, Python code, and GUI operations. This automation can improve the productivity of experts while democratizing access to large-scale data analysis. In this paper, we introduce Spider2-V, the first multimodal agent benchmark focusing on professional data science and engineering workflows, featuring 494 real-world tasks in authentic computer environments and incorporating 20 enterprise-level professional applications. These tasks, derived from real-world use cases, evaluate the ability of a multimodal agent to perform data-related tasks by writing code and managing the GUI in enterprise data software systems. To balance realistic simulation with evaluation simplicity, we devote significant effort to developing automatic configurations for task setup and carefully crafting evaluation metrics for each task. Furthermore, we supplement multimodal agents with comprehensive documents of these enterprise data software systems. Our empirical evaluation reveals that existing state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents do not reliably automate full data workflows (14.0% success). Even with step-by-step guidance, these agents still underperform in tasks that require fine-grained, knowledge-intensive GUI actions (16.2%) and involve remote cloud-hosted workspaces (10.6%). We hope that Spider2-V paves the way for autonomous multimodal agents to transform the automation of data science and engineering workflow.

To improve cross-modality alignment, existing works usually consider more visual instruction data covering a broader range of vision tasks to fine-tune the model for question-answering, which, however, is costly to obtain and has not thoroughly explored the rich contextual information contained in images. This paper first attempts to harness the overlooked context within visual instruction data, training the model to self-supervised "learning" how to ask high-quality questions. In this way, we introduce a novel framework named SQ-LLaVA: Self-Questioning for Large Vision-Language Assistant. SQ-LLaVA exhibits proficiency in generating flexible and meaningful image-related questions while analyzing the visual clue and prior language knowledge, signifying an advanced level of generalized visual understanding. Moreover, fine-tuning SQ-LLaVA on higher-quality instruction data shows a performance improvement compared with traditional visual-instruction tuning methods. This improvement highlights the efficacy of self-questioning techniques in achieving a deeper and more nuanced comprehension of visual content across various contexts.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[Benchmarking Vision Language Models for Cultural Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10920v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have notably advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their performance has been typically assessed on general scene understanding - recognizing objects, attributes, and actions - rather than cultural comprehension. This study introduces CulturalVQA, a visual question-answering benchmark aimed at assessing VLM's geo-diverse cultural understanding. We curate a collection of 2,378 image-question pairs with 1-5 answers per question representing cultures from 11 countries across 5 continents. The questions probe understanding of various facets of culture such as clothing, food, drinks, rituals, and traditions. Benchmarking VLMs on CulturalVQA, including GPT-4V and Gemini, reveals disparity in their level of cultural understanding across regions, with strong cultural understanding capabilities for North America while significantly lower performance for Africa. We observe disparity in their performance across cultural facets too, with clothing, rituals, and traditions seeing higher performances than food and drink. These disparities help us identify areas where VLMs lack cultural understanding and demonstrate the potential of CulturalVQA as a comprehensive evaluation set for gauging VLM progress in understanding diverse cultures.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoEval-Video: An Automatic Benchmark for Assessing Large Vision Language Models in Open-Ended Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14906v2)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel and challenging benchmark, AutoEval-Video, to comprehensively evaluate large vision-language models in open-ended video question answering. The comprehensiveness of AutoEval-Video is demonstrated in two aspects: 1) AutoEval-Video constructs open-ended video-questions across 9 skill dimensions, addressing capabilities of perception, comprehension, and generation. 2) AutoEval-Video contains newly collected videos that cover over 40 distinct themes. To efficiently evaluate responses to the open-ended questions, we employ an LLM-based evaluation approach, but instead of merely providing a reference answer, we annotate unique evaluation rules for every single instance (video-question pair). To maximize the robustness of these rules, we develop a novel adversarial annotation mechanism. By using instance-specific rules as prompt, GPT-4, as an automatic evaluator, can achieve a stable evaluation accuracy of around 97.0%, comparable to the 94.9% - 97.5% accuracy of a human evaluator. Furthermore, we assess the performance of eight large vision-language models on AutoEval-Video. Among them, GPT-4V(ision) significantly outperforms other models, achieving an accuracy of 32.2%. However, there is still substantial room for improvement compared to human accuracy of 72.8%. By conducting an extensive case study, we uncover several drawbacks of GPT-4V, such as limited temporal and dynamic comprehension, and overly general responses.

Although such foundation models perform well in a wide range of general tasks, their capability without fine-tuning is often limited in specialized tasks. However, full fine-tuning of large foundation models is challenging due to enormous computation/memory/dataset requirements. We show that GPT-4o can decode hand gestures from forearm ultrasound data even with no fine-tuning, and improves with few-shot, in-context learning.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

| **[3D Feature Distillation with Object-Centric Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18742v3)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding natural language to the physical world is a ubiquitous topic with a wide range of applications in computer vision and robotics. Recently, 2D vision-language models such as CLIP have been widely popularized, due to their impressive capabilities for open-vocabulary grounding in 2D images. Recent works aim to elevate 2D CLIP features to 3D via feature distillation, but either learn neural fields that are scene-specific and hence lack generalization, or focus on indoor room scan data that require access to multiple camera views, which is not practical in robot manipulation scenarios. Additionally, related methods typically fuse features at pixel-level and assume that all camera views are equally informative. In this work, we show that this approach leads to sub-optimal 3D features, both in terms of grounding accuracy, as well as segmentation crispness. To alleviate this, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that employs object-centric priors to eliminate uninformative views based on semantic information, and fuse features at object-level via instance segmentation masks. To distill our object-centric 3D features, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset of cluttered tabletop scenes, spawning 15k scenes from over 3300 unique object instances, which we make publicly available. We show that our method reconstructs 3D CLIP features with improved grounding capacity and spatial consistency, while doing so from single-view RGB-D, thus departing from the assumption of multiple camera views at test time. Finally, we show that our approach can generalize to novel tabletop domains and be re-purposed for 3D instance segmentation without fine-tuning, and demonstrate its utility for language-guided robotic grasping in clutter</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Open-World Grasping with Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18722v3)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to grasp objects in-the-wild from open-ended language instructions constitutes a fundamental challenge in robotics. An open-world grasping system should be able to combine high-level contextual with low-level physical-geometric reasoning in order to be applicable in arbitrary scenarios. Recent works exploit the web-scale knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs) to plan and reason in robotic context, but rely on external vision and action models to ground such knowledge into the environment and parameterize actuation. This setup suffers from two major bottlenecks: a) the LLM's reasoning capacity is constrained by the quality of visual grounding, and b) LLMs do not contain low-level spatial understanding of the world, which is essential for grasping in contact-rich scenarios. In this work we demonstrate that modern vision-language models (VLMs) are capable of tackling such limitations, as they are implicitly grounded and can jointly reason about semantics and geometry. We propose OWG, an open-world grasping pipeline that combines VLMs with segmentation and grasp synthesis models to unlock grounded world understanding in three stages: open-ended referring segmentation, grounded grasp planning and grasp ranking via contact reasoning, all of which can be applied zero-shot via suitable visual prompting mechanisms. We conduct extensive evaluation in cluttered indoor scene datasets to showcase OWG's robustness in grounding from open-ended language, as well as open-world robotic grasping experiments in both simulation and hardware that demonstrate superior performance compared to previous supervised and zero-shot LLM-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conceptual Codebook Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02350v3)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Conceptual Codebook Learning (CoCoLe), a novel fine-tuning method for vision-language models (VLMs) to address the challenge of improving the generalization capability of VLMs while fine-tuning them on downstream tasks in a few-shot setting. We recognize that visual concepts, such as textures, shapes, and colors are naturally transferable across domains and play a crucial role in generalization tasks. Motivated by this interesting finding, we learn a conceptual codebook consisting of visual concepts as keys and conceptual prompts as values, which serves as a link between the image encoder's outputs and the text encoder's inputs. Specifically, for a given image, we leverage the codebook to identify the most relevant conceptual prompts associated with the class embeddings to perform the classification. Additionally, we incorporate a handcrafted concept cache as a regularization to alleviate the overfitting issues in low-shot scenarios. We observe that this conceptual codebook learning method is able to achieve enhanced alignment between visual and linguistic modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our CoCoLe method remarkably outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation settings, including base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization tasks. Detailed ablation studies further confirm the efficacy of each component in CoCoLe.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Naturally, how to transfer the rich knowledge in such huge pre-trained models to downstream tasks and datasets becomes a hot topic. During downstream adaptation, the most challenging problems are overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, which can cause the model to overly focus on the current data and lose more crucial domain-general knowledge. Existing works use classic regularization techniques to solve the problems. As solutions become increasingly complex, the ever-growing storage and inference costs are also a significant problem that urgently needs to be addressed. While in this paper, we start from an observation that proper random noise can suppress overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. Then we regard quantization error as a kind of noise, and explore quantization for regularizing vision-language model, which is quite efficiency and effective. Furthermore, to improve the model's generalization capability while maintaining its specialization capacity at minimal cost, we deeply analyze the characteristics of the weight distribution in prompts, conclude several principles for quantization module design and follow such principles to create several competitive baselines. The proposed method is significantly efficient due to its inherent lightweight nature, making it possible to adapt on extremely resource-limited devices. Our method can be fruitfully integrated into many existing approaches like MaPLe, enhancing accuracy while reducing storage overhead, making it more powerful yet versatile. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets shows great superiority of our method sufficiently.

A key innovation of Cephalo is its advanced dataset generation method. Cephalo is trained on integrated image and text data from thousands of scientific papers and science-focused Wikipedia data demonstrates can interpret complex visual scenes, generate precise language descriptions, and answer queries about images effectively. The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports multimodal natural language understanding, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image-to-text-to-3D pipeline. To develop more capable models from smaller ones, we report both mixture-of-expert methods and model merging. We examine the models in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio-inspired design based on insect behavior. Generative applications include bio-inspired designs, including pollen-inspired architected materials, as well as the synthesis of bio-inspired material microstructures from a photograph of a solar eclipse. Additional model fine-tuning with a series of molecular dynamics results demonstrate Cephalo's enhanced capabilities to accurately predict statistical features of stress and atomic energy distributions, as well as crack dynamics and damage in materials.</p></details> |  |

We align detector with the text encoder from VLM by replacing the fixed classification layer weights in detector with the class-name embeddings extracted from the text encoder. Without additional fusing module, OVLW-DETR is flexible and deployment friendly, making it easier to implement and modulate. improving the efficiency of interleaved attention computation.

Previous works primarily focus on prompt learning to adapt the CLIP into a variety of downstream tasks, however, suffering from task overfitting when finetuned on a small data set. In this paper, we introduce an orthogonal finetuning method for efficiently updating pretrained weights which enhances robustness and generalization, while a cross-regularization strategy is further exploited to maintain the stability in terms of zero-shot generalization of VLMs, dubbed \textbf{\textit{OrthCR}}. Specifically, trainable orthogonal matrices are injected seamlessly into the transformer architecture and enforced with orthogonality constraint using Cayley parameterization, benefiting from the norm-preserving property and thus leading to stable and faster convergence. To alleviate deviation from orthogonal constraint during training, a cross-regularization strategy is further employed with initial pretrained weights within a bypass manner. In addition, to enrich the sample diversity for downstream tasks, we first explore Cutout data augmentation to boost the efficient finetuning and comprehend how our approach improves the specific downstream performance and maintains the generalizability in the perspective of Orthogonality Learning. Beyond existing prompt learning techniques, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method explicitly steers pretrained weight space to represent the task-specific knowledge and presents competitive generalizability under base-to-base/base-to-new, cross-dataset transfer and domain generalization evaluations.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs and VLMs, through extensive training on large amounts of human-curated data, have attained a high level of pseudo-human intelligence in some common sense reasoning tasks, they still struggle with more complex reasoning tasks that require cognitive understanding. In this work, we introduce a new dataset, NTSEBench, designed to evaluate the cognitive multi-modal reasoning and problem-solving skills of large models. The dataset comprises 2,728 multiple-choice questions comprising of a total of 4,642 images across 26 categories sampled from the NTSE examination conducted nationwide in India, featuring both visual and textual general aptitude questions that do not rely on rote learning.

A comprehensive quantitative evaluation is necessary to identify and understand the extent of hallucinations in these models. However, existing benchmarks are often limited in scope, focusing mainly on object hallucinations. Furthermore, current evaluation methods struggle to effectively address the subtle semantic distinctions between model outputs and reference data, as well as the balance between hallucination and informativeness. To address these issues, we introduce a multi-dimensional benchmark covering objects, attributes, and relations, with challenging images selected based on associative biases. Moreover, we propose a large language model (LLM)-based two-stage evaluation framework that generalizes the popular CHAIR metric and incorporates both faithfulness and coverage into the evaluation. Experiments on 10 established LVLMs demonstrate that our evaluation metric is more comprehensive and better correlated with humans than existing work when evaluating on our challenging human-annotated benchmark dataset. Our work also highlights the critical balance between faithfulness and coverage of model outputs, and encourages future works to address hallucinations in LVLMs while keeping their outputs informative.</p></details> | ACL 2024 Findings |

However, obtaining a robust and dense reward signal for general manipulation tasks remains a challenge. Existing learning-based approaches require significant data, such as demonstrations or examples of success and failure, to learn task-specific reward functions. Recently, there is also a growing adoption of large multi-modal foundation models for robotics. These models can perform visual reasoning in physical contexts and generate coarse robot motions for various manipulation tasks. Motivated by this range of capability, in this work, we propose and study rewards shaped by vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art VLMs have demonstrated an impressive ability to reason about affordances through keypoints in zero-shot, and we leverage this to define dense rewards for robotic learning. On a real-world manipulation task specified by natural language description, we find that these rewards improve the sample efficiency of autonomous RL and enable successful completion of the task in 20K online finetuning steps. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of the approach to reductions in the number of in-domain demonstrations used for pretraining, reaching comparable performance in 35K online finetuning steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures.

The embeddings from the two encoders are used to compute the respective prototypes of image classes for classification. During adaptation, we propose aligning the image and text prototypes of the corresponding classes.

Research in SFDG primarily bulids upon the existing knowledge of large-scale vision-language models and utilizes the pre-trained model's joint vision-language space to simulate style transfer across domains, thus eliminating the dependency on source domain images. However, how to efficiently simulate rich and diverse styles using text prompts, and how to extract domain-invariant information useful for classification from features that contain both semantic and style information after the encoder, are directions that merit improvement. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic PromptStyler (DPStyler), comprising Style Generation and Style Removal modules to address these issues. The Style Generation module refreshes all styles at every training epoch, while the Style Removal module eliminates variations in the encoder's output features caused by input styles. Moreover, since the Style Generation module, responsible for generating style word vectors using random sampling or style mixing, makes the model sensitive to input text prompts, we introduce a model ensemble method to mitigate this sensitivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE TMM |

We evaluate the effectiveness of MuDPT on few-shot vision recognition and out-of-domain generalization tasks.

To address this issue, we introduce Vision-Language Model Predictive Control (VLMPC), a robotic manipulation framework which takes advantage of the powerful perception capability of vision language model (VLM) and integrates it with MPC. Specifically, we propose a conditional action sampling module which takes as input a goal image or a language instruction and leverages VLM to sample a set of candidate action sequences. Then, a lightweight action-conditioned video prediction model is designed to generate a set of future frames conditioned on the candidate action sequences. VLMPC produces the optimal action sequence with the assistance of VLM through a hierarchical cost function that formulates both pixel-level and knowledge-level consistence between the current observation and the goal image. We demonstrate that VLMPC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks. More importantly, our method showcases excellent performance in various real-world tasks of robotic manipulation.

Specifically, our method exploits the superior generalization ability of the 2D vision-language models and proposes the Embeddings Soft-Guidance Stage to utilize it to implicitly align 3D embeddings and text embeddings. Moreover, we introduce the Embeddings Specialization Stage to purify the feature representation with the help of a given scene-level label, specifying a better feature supervised by the corresponding text embedding. Thus, the 3D model is able to gain informative supervisions both from the image embedding and text embedding, leading to competitive segmentation performances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation by using the textual semantic information of text category labels. Moreover, with extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, we present that our 3DSS-VLG is able not only to achieve the state-of-the-art performance on both S3DIS and ScanNet datasets, but also to maintain strong generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

Most methods require unbiased data during training (and/or hyper-parameter tuning) to counteract shortcut learning. Here, we propose the use of explanation distillation to hinder shortcut learning. The technique does not assume any access to unbiased data, and it allows an arbitrarily sized student network to learn the reasons behind the decisions of an unbiased teacher, such as a vision-language model or a network processing debiased images. We found that it is possible to train a neural network with explanation (e.g by Layer Relevance Propagation, LRP) distillation only, and that the technique leads to high resistance to shortcut learning, surpassing group-invariant learning, explanation background minimization, and alternative distillation techniques. In the COLOURED MNIST dataset, LRP distillation achieved 98.2% OOD accuracy, while deep feature distillation and IRM achieved 92.1% and 60.2%, respectively. In COCO-on-Places, the undesirable generalization gap between in-distribution and OOD accuracy is only of 4.4% for LRP distillation, while the other two techniques present gaps of 15.1% and 52.1%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Previous open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding methods mostly focus on training 3D models using either image or text supervision while neglecting the collective strength of all modalities. In this work, we propose a Dense Multimodal Alignment (DMA) framework to densely co-embed different modalities into a common space for maximizing their synergistic benefits. Instead of extracting coarse view- or region-level text prompts, we leverage large vision-language models to extract complete category information and scalable scene descriptions to build the text modality, and take image modality as the bridge to build dense point-pixel-text associations. Besides, in order to enhance the generalization ability of the 2D model for downstream 3D tasks without compromising the open-vocabulary capability, we employ a dual-path integration approach to combine frozen CLIP visual features and learnable mask features. Extensive experiments show that our DMA method produces highly competitive open-vocabulary segmentation performance on various indoor and outdoor tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

| **[Vision-Language Models as a Source of Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09187v3)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building generalist agents that can accomplish many goals in rich open-ended environments is one of the research frontiers for reinforcement learning. A key limiting factor for building generalist agents with RL has been the need for a large number of reward functions for achieving different goals. We investigate the feasibility of using off-the-shelf vision-language models, or VLMs, as sources of rewards for reinforcement learning agents. We show how rewards for visual achievement of a variety of language goals can be derived from the CLIP family of models, and used to train RL agents that can achieve a variety of language goals. We showcase this approach in two distinct visual domains and present a scaling trend showing how larger VLMs lead to more accurate rewards for visual goal achievement, which in turn produces more capable RL agents.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Robotic Control via Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08693v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key limitation of learned robot control policies is their inability to generalize outside their training data. Recent works on vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown that the use of large, internet pre-trained vision-language models as the backbone of learned robot policies can substantially improve their robustness and generalization ability. Yet, one of the most exciting capabilities of large vision-language models in other domains is their ability to reason iteratively through complex problems. Can that same capability be brought into robotics to allow policies to improve performance by reasoning about a given task before acting? Naive use of "chain-of-thought" (CoT) style prompting is significantly less effective with standard VLAs because of the relatively simple training examples that are available to them. Additionally, purely semantic reasoning about sub-tasks, as is common in regular CoT, is insufficient for robot policies that need to ground their reasoning in sensory observations and the robot state. To this end, we introduce Embodied Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (ECoT) for VLAs, in which we train VLAs to perform multiple steps of reasoning about plans, sub-tasks, motions, and visually grounded features like object bounding boxes and end effector positions, before predicting the robot action. We design a scalable pipeline for generating synthetic training data for ECoT on large robot datasets. We demonstrate, that ECoT increases the absolute success rate of OpenVLA, the current strongest open-source VLA policy, by 28% across challenging generalization tasks, without any additional robot training data. Additionally, ECoT makes it easier for humans to interpret a policy's failures and correct its behavior using natural language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://embodied-cot.github.io</p></details> |

To further adapt VLMs to downstream tasks, soft prompt is proposed to replace manually designed prompt, which undergoes fine-tuning based on specific domain data. Prior prompt learning methods primarily learn a fixed prompt or residuled prompt from training samples. However, the learned prompts lack diversity and ignore information about unseen domains. In this paper, we reframe the prompt learning framework from a generative perspective and propose a simple yet efficient method for the Domain Generalization (DG) task, namely Soft Prompt Generation (SPG). Specifically, SPG consists of a two-stage training phase and an inference phase. During the training phase, we introduce soft prompt label for each domain, aiming to incorporate the generative model domain knowledge. During the inference phase, the generator of the generative model is employed to obtain instance-specific soft prompts for the unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on five domain generalization benchmarks of three DG tasks demonstrate that SPG achieves state-of-the-art performance.

To achieve this, we study a widely useful category of navigation tasks we call Multimodal Instruction Navigation with demonstration Tours (MINT), in which the environment prior is provided through a previously recorded demonstration video. Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown a promising path in achieving this goal as it demonstrates capabilities in perceiving and reasoning about multimodal inputs. However, VLMs are typically trained to predict textual output and it is an open research question about how to best utilize them in navigation. To solve MINT, we present Mobility VLA, a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) navigation policy that combines the environment understanding and common sense reasoning power of long-context VLMs and a robust low-level navigation policy based on topological graphs. The high-level policy consists of a long-context VLM that takes the demonstration tour video and the multimodal user instruction as input to find the goal frame in the tour video. Next, a low-level policy uses the goal frame and an offline constructed topological graph to generate robot actions at every timestep. We evaluated Mobility VLA in a 836m^2 real world environment and show that Mobility VLA has a high end-to-end success rates on previously unsolved multimodal instructions such as "Where should I return this?" while holding a plastic bin. A video demonstrating Mobility VLA can be found here: https://youtu.be/-Tof__Q8_5s</p></details> |  |

Our exploration of open-vocabulary (OV) learning in urban environments aims to capture novel instances using pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with multi-sensor data. We design and benchmark a set of four potential solutions as baselines, categorizing them into either top-down or bottom-up approaches based on their input data strategies. While effective, these methods exhibit certain limitations, such as missing novel objects in 3D box estimation or applying rigorous priors, leading to biases towards objects near the camera or of rectangular geometries. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a universal \textsc{Find n' Propagate} approach for 3D OV tasks, aimed at maximizing the recall of novel objects and propagating this detection capability to more distant areas thereby progressively capturing more. In particular, we utilize a greedy box seeker to search against 3D novel boxes of varying orientations and depth in each generated frustum and ensure the reliability of newly identified boxes by cross alignment and density ranker. Additionally, the inherent bias towards camera-proximal objects is alleviated by the proposed remote simulator, which randomly diversifies pseudo-labeled novel instances in the self-training process, combined with the fusion of base samples in the memory bank. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 53% improvement in novel recall across diverse OV settings, VLMs, and 3D detectors. Notably, we achieve up to a 3.97-fold increase in Average Precision (AP) for novel object classes.

However, due to variations in camera specifications and mounting positions, existing methods exhibit significant performance disparities across different robotic platforms. To address this challenge, we propose RoboUniView in this paper, an innovative approach that decouples visual feature extraction from action learning. We first learn a unified view representation from multi-perspective views by pre-training on readily accessible data, and then derive actions from this unified view representation to control robotic manipulation. This unified view representation more accurately mirrors the physical world and is not constrained by the robotic platform's camera parameters. Thanks to this methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the demanding CALVIN benchmark, enhancing the success rate in the $D \to D$ setting from 93.0% to 96.2%, and in the $ABC \to D$ setting from 92.2% to 94.2%. Moreover, our model exhibits outstanding adaptability and flexibility: it maintains high performance under unseen camera parameters, can utilize multiple datasets with varying camera parameters, and is capable of joint cross-task learning across datasets. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/liufanfanlff/RoboUniview</p></details> |  |

Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Navi2Gaze: Leveraging Foundation Models for Navigation and Target Gazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09053v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task-aware navigation continues to be a challenging area of research, especially in scenarios involving open vocabulary. Previous studies primarily focus on finding suitable locations for task completion, often overlooking the importance of the robot's pose. However, the robot's orientation is crucial for successfully completing tasks because of how objects are arranged (e.g., to open a refrigerator door). Humans intuitively navigate to objects with the right orientation using semantics and common sense. For instance, when opening a refrigerator, we naturally stand in front of it rather than to the side. Recent advances suggest that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can provide robots with similar common sense. Therefore, we develop a VLM-driven method called Navigation-to-Gaze (Navi2Gaze) for efficient navigation and object gazing based on task descriptions. This method uses the VLM to score and select the best pose from numerous candidates automatically. In evaluations on multiple photorealistic simulation benchmarks, Navi2Gaze significantly outperforms existing approaches and precisely determines the optimal orientation relative to target objects.</p></details> |  |

We employ the text embeddings as object queries within a transformer-based segmentation framework (textual object queries). These queries are regarded as a domain-invariant basis for pixel grouping in DGSS. To leverage the power of textual object queries, we introduce a novel framework named the textual query-driven mask transformer (tqdm). Our tqdm aims to (1) generate textual object queries that maximally encode domain-invariant semantics and (2) enhance the semantic clarity of dense visual features. Additionally, we suggest three regularization losses to improve the efficacy of tqdm by aligning between visual and textual features. By utilizing our method, the model can comprehend inherent semantic information for classes of interest, enabling it to generalize to extreme domains (e.g., sketch style). Our tqdm achieves 68.9 mIoU on GTA5$\rightarrow$Cityscapes, outperforming the prior state-of-the-art method by 2.5 mIoU.

Existing methods often struggle to generalize to open vocabulary goals without extensive training data. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising solution by extending object recognition beyond predefined categories, efficient goal-oriented exploration becomes more challenging in an open vocabulary setting. We introduce OVExp, a learning-based framework that integrates VLMs for Open-Vocabulary Exploration. OVExp constructs scene representations by encoding observations with VLMs and projecting them onto top-down maps for goal-conditioned exploration. Goals are encoded in the same VLM feature space, and a lightweight transformer-based decoder predicts target locations while maintaining versatile representation abilities. To address the impracticality of fusing dense pixel embeddings with full 3D scene reconstruction for training, we propose constructing maps using low-cost semantic categories and transforming them into CLIP's embedding space via the text encoder. The simple but effective design of OVExp significantly reduces computational costs and demonstrates strong generalization abilities to various navigation settings. Experiments on established benchmarks show OVExp outperforms previous zero-shot methods, can generalize to diverse scenes, and handle different goal modalities.</p></details> |  |

We propose BlindTest, a suite of 7 visual tasks absurdly easy to humans such as identifying (a) whether two circles overlap; (b) whether two lines intersect; (c) which letter is being circled in a word; and (d) counting the number of circles in a Olympic-like logo. Surprisingly, four state-of-the-art VLMs are, on average, only 56.20% accurate on our benchmark, with \newsonnet being the best (73.77% accuracy). On BlindTest, VLMs struggle with tasks that requires precise spatial information and counting (from 0 to 10), sometimes providing an impression of a person with myopia seeing fine details as blurry and making educated guesses.

Compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), LVLMs present great potential and challenges due to its closer proximity to the multi-resource real-world applications and the complexity of multi-modal processing. However, the vulnerability of LVLMs is relatively underexplored, posing potential security risks in daily usage. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the various forms of existing LVLM attacks. Specifically, we first introduce the background of attacks targeting LVLMs, including the attack preliminary, attack challenges, and attack resources. Then, we systematically review the development of LVLM attack methods, such as adversarial attacks that manipulate model outputs, jailbreak attacks that exploit model vulnerabilities for unauthorized actions, prompt injection attacks that engineer the prompt type and pattern, and data poisoning that affects model training. Finally, we discuss promising research directions in the future. We believe that our survey provides insights into the current landscape of LVLM vulnerabilities, inspiring more researchers to explore and mitigate potential safety issues in LVLM developments.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

While these models are highly adaptable to new tasks, scaling and evaluating their usage presents new challenges not addressed in previous frameworks. In particular, the ability of these models to produce useful outputs with little to no specialized training data ("zero-" or "few-shot" approaches), as well as the open-ended nature of their outputs, necessitate the development of new guidelines for robust reporting of clinical generative model research. In response to gaps in standards and best practices for the development of clinical AI tools identified by US Executive Order 141103 and several emerging national networks for clinical AI evaluation, we begin to formalize some of these guidelines by building on the original MI-CLAIM checklist. The new checklist, MI-CLAIM-GEN (Table 1), aims to address differences in training, evaluation, interpretability, and reproducibility of new generative models compared to non-generative ("predictive") AI models. This MI-CLAIM-GEN checklist also seeks to clarify cohort selection reporting with unstructured clinical data and adds additional items on alignment with ethical standards for clinical AI research.</p></details> |  |

They tend to hallucinate and may generate biased responses. In such circumstances, having a way to assess the reliability of a given response generated by a VLM is quite useful. Existing methods, such as estimating uncertainty using answer likelihoods or prompt-based confidence generation, often suffer from overconfidence. Other methods use self-consistency comparison but are affected by confirmation biases. To alleviate these, we propose \textbf{De}compose and \textbf{C}ompare \textbf{C}onsistency (\texttt{DeCC}) for reliability measurement. By comparing the consistency between the direct answer generated using the VLM's internal reasoning process, and the indirect answers obtained by decomposing the question into sub-questions and reasoning over the sub-answers produced by the VLM, \texttt{DeCC} measures the reliability of VLM's direct answer. Experiments across six vision-language tasks with three VLMs show \texttt{DeCC}'s reliability estimation achieves better correlation with task accuracy compared to the existing methods.</p></details> | Preprint |

Recent large vision-language model-based AI-powered tools like Be My AI are more capable of understanding users' inquiries in natural language and describing the scene in audible text; however, the extent to which these tools are useful to visually impaired users is currently understudied. This paper aims to fill this gap. Our study with 14 visually impaired users reveals that they are adapting these tools organically -- not only can these tools facilitate complex interactions in household, spatial, and social contexts, but they also act as an extension of users' cognition, as if the cognition were distributed in the visual information. We also found that although the tools are currently not goal-oriented, users accommodate this limitation and embrace the tools' capabilities for broader use. These findings enable us to envision design implications for creating more goal-oriented, real-time processing, and reliable AI-powered assistive technology.</p></details> |  |

Medicine's inherently multimodal nature incorporating scans and text-based medical histories to write reports makes it conducive to benefit from these leaps in AI capabilities. We evaluate the publicly available, state of the art, foundational vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretation across several datasets and benchmarks. We use linear probes to evaluate the performance of various components including CheXagent's vision transformer and Q-former, which outperform the industry-standard Torch X-ray Vision models across many different datasets showing robust generalisation capabilities. Importantly, we find that vision-language models often hallucinate with confident language, which slows down clinical interpretation. Based on these findings, we develop an agent-based vision-language approach for report generation using CheXagent's linear probes and BioViL-T's phrase grounding tools to generate uncertainty-aware radiology reports with pathologies localised and described based on their likelihood. We thoroughly evaluate our vision-language agents using NLP metrics, chest X-ray benchmarks and clinical evaluations by developing an evaluation platform to perform a user study with respiratory specialists. Our results show considerable improvements in accuracy, interpretability and safety of the AI-generated reports. We stress the importance of analysing results for normal and abnormal scans separately. Finally, we emphasise the need for larger paired (scan and report) datasets alongside data augmentation to tackle overfitting seen in these large vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Super...</summary><p>Supervised by Professor Ben Glocker</p></details> |

In this work, we show these models can memorize responses for training samples and regurgitate them even when the relevant visual information has been removed. This includes Personal Identifiable Information (PII) repeated once in the training set, indicating these models could divulge memorised sensitive information and therefore pose a privacy risk. We quantitatively measure the extractability of information in controlled experiments and differentiate between cases where it arises from generalization capabilities or from memorization. We further investigate the factors that influence memorization across multiple state-of-the-art models and propose an effective heuristic countermeasure that empirically prevents the extractability of PII.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

To reduce the training and computation costs caused by high-resolution input, one promising direction is to use sliding windows to slice the input into uniform patches, each matching the input size of the well-trained vision encoder. Although efficient, this slicing strategy leads to the fragmentation of original input, i.e., the continuity of contextual information and spatial geometry is lost across patches, adversely affecting performance in cross-patch context perception and position-specific tasks. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce HiRes-LLaVA, a novel framework designed to efficiently process any size of high-resolution input without altering the original contextual and geometric information. HiRes-LLaVA comprises two innovative components: (i) a SliceRestore adapter that reconstructs sliced patches into their original form, efficiently extracting both global and local features via down-up-sampling and convolution layers, and (ii) a Self-Mining Sampler to compresses the vision tokens based on themselves, preserving the original context and positional information while reducing training overhead. To assess the ability of handling context fragmentation, we construct a new benchmark, EntityGrid-QA, consisting of edge-related and position-related tasks. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of HiRes-LLaVA on both existing public benchmarks and on EntityGrid-QA, particularly on document-oriented tasks, establishing new standards for handling high-resolution inputs.</p></details> |  |

We observe that existing methods encounter three major challenges: 1) escalating resource demands and prolonging training times, 2) contending with excessive learnable parameters, and 3) fine-tuning based only on a single modality. These challenges will hinder their capability to adapt Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. Motivated by this critical observation, we propose a novel method called NODE-Adapter, which utilizes Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for better vision-language reasoning. To fully leverage both visual and textual modalities and estimate class prototypes more effectively and accurately, we divide our method into two stages: cross-modal prototype construction and cross-modal prototype optimization using neural ordinary differential equations. Specifically, we exploit VLM to encode hand-crafted prompts into textual features and few-shot support images into visual features. Then, we estimate the textual prototype and visual prototype by averaging the textual features and visual features, respectively, and adaptively combine the textual prototype and visual prototype to construct the cross-modal prototype. To alleviate the prototype bias, we then model the prototype optimization process as an initial value problem with Neural ODEs to estimate the continuous gradient flow. Our extensive experimental results, which cover few-shot classification, domain generalization, and visual reasoning on human-object interaction, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

Conventional approaches are mostly supervised learning, requiring extensive collections of facial videos and synchronously recorded photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. To tackle it, self-supervised learning has recently gained attentions; due to the lack of ground truth PPG signals, its performance is however limited. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised framework that successfully integrates the popular vision-language models (VLMs) into the remote physiological measurement task. Given a facial video, we first augment its positive and negative video samples with varying rPPG signal frequencies. Next, we introduce a frequency-oriented vision-text pair generation method by carefully creating contrastive spatio-temporal maps from positive and negative samples and designing proper text prompts to describe their relative ratios of signal frequencies. A pre-trained VLM is employed to extract features for these formed vision-text pairs and estimate rPPG signals thereafter. We develop a series of generative and contrastive learning mechanisms to optimize the VLM, including the text-guided visual map reconstruction task, the vision-text contrastive learning task, and the frequency contrastive and ranking task. Overall, our method for the first time adapts VLMs to digest and align the frequency-related knowledge in vision and text modalities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state of the art self-supervised methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specialist vision-language models for clinical ophthalmology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08410v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinicians spend a significant amount of time reviewing medical images and transcribing their findings regarding patient diagnosis, referral and treatment in text form. Vision-language models (VLMs), which automatically interpret images and summarize their findings as text, have enormous potential to alleviate clinical workloads and increase patient access to high-quality medical care. While foundational models have stirred considerable interest in the medical community, it is unclear whether their general capabilities translate to real-world clinical utility. In this work, we show that foundation VLMs markedly underperform compared to practicing ophthalmologists on specialist tasks crucial to the care of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). To address this, we initially identified the essential capabilities required for image-based clinical decision-making, and then developed a curriculum to selectively train VLMs in these skills. The resulting model, RetinaVLM, can be instructed to write reports that significantly outperform those written by leading foundation medical VLMs in disease staging (F1 score of 0.63 vs. 0.11) and patient referral (0.67 vs. 0.39), and approaches the diagnostic performance of junior ophthalmologists (who achieve 0.77 and 0.78 on the respective tasks). Furthermore, in a reader study involving two senior ophthalmologists with up to 32 years of experience, RetinaVLM's reports were found to be similarly correct (78.6% vs. 82.1%) and complete (both 78.6%) as reports written by junior ophthalmologists with up to 10 years of experience. These results demonstrate that our curriculum-based approach provides a blueprint for specializing generalist foundation medical VLMs to handle real-world clinical tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nature Medicine</p></details> |

Despite their potential, research in autonomous systems is hindered by the lack of datasets with annotated reasoning chains that explain the decision-making processes in driving. To bridge this gap, we present Reason2Drive, a benchmark dataset with over 600K video-text pairs, aimed at facilitating the study of interpretable reasoning in complex driving environments. We distinctly characterize the autonomous driving process as a sequential combination of perception, prediction, and reasoning steps, and the question-answer pairs are automatically collected from a diverse range of open-source outdoor driving datasets, including nuScenes, Waymo and ONCE. Moreover, we introduce a novel aggregated evaluation metric to assess chain-based reasoning performance in autonomous systems, addressing the semantic ambiguities of existing metrics such as BLEU and CIDEr. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conduct experiments to assess various existing VLMs, revealing insights into their reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we develop an efficient approach to empower VLMs to leverage object-level perceptual elements in both feature extraction and prediction, further enhancing their reasoning accuracy. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, its application to OVSS faces challenges due to its initial image-level alignment training, which affects its performance in tasks requiring detailed local context. Our study delves into the impact of CLIP's [CLS] token on patch feature correlations, revealing a dominance of "global" patches that hinders local feature discrimination. To overcome this, we propose CLIPtrase, a novel training-free semantic segmentation strategy that enhances local feature awareness through recalibrated self-correlation among patches. This approach demonstrates notable improvements in segmentation accuracy and the ability to maintain semantic coherence across objects.Experiments show that we are 22.3% ahead of CLIP on average on 9 segmentation benchmarks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art training-free methods.The code are made publicly available at: https://github.com/leaves162/CLIPtrase.</p></details> | ECCV24 accepted |

Previous efforts have primarily focused on investigating object hallucinations, which can be easily alleviated by introducing object detectors. However, these efforts neglect hallucinations in inter-object relationships, which is essential for visual comprehension. In this work, we introduce R-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating Vision Relationship Hallucination. R-Bench features image-level questions that focus on the existence of relationships and instance-level questions that assess local visual comprehension. We identify three types of relationship co-occurrences that lead to hallucinations: relationship-relationship, subject-relationship, and relationship-object. The visual instruction tuning dataset's long-tail distribution significantly impacts LVLMs' understanding of visual relationships. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current LVLMs tend to disregard visual content and overly rely on the common sense knowledge of Large Language Models. They also struggle with reasoning about spatial relationships based on contextual information.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML2...</summary><p>ICML2024; Project Page:https://github.com/mrwu-mac/R-Bench</p></details> |

Existing prompting techniques primarily focus on global text and image representations, yet overlooking multi-modal attribute characteristics. This limitation hinders the model's ability to perceive fine-grained visual details and restricts its generalization ability to a broader range of unseen classes. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-modal Attribute Prompting method (MAP) by jointly exploring textual attribute prompting, visual attribute prompting, and attribute-level alignment. The proposed MAP enjoys several merits. First, we introduce learnable visual attribute prompts enhanced by textual attribute semantics to adaptively capture visual attributes for images from unknown categories, boosting fine-grained visual perception capabilities for CLIP. Second, the proposed attribute-level alignment complements the global alignment to enhance the robustness of cross-modal alignment for open-vocabulary objects. To our knowledge, this is the first work to establish cross-modal attribute-level alignment for CLIP-based few-shot adaptation. Extensive experimental results on 11 datasets demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT)</p></details> |
| **[Tuning Vision-Language Models with Candidate Labels by Prompt Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07638v2)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) can learn high-quality representations from a large-scale training dataset of image-text pairs. Prompt learning is a popular approach to fine-tuning VLM to adapt them to downstream tasks. Despite the satisfying performance, a major limitation of prompt learning is the demand for labelled data. In real-world scenarios, we may only obtain candidate labels (where the true label is included) instead of the true labels due to data privacy or sensitivity issues. In this paper, we provide the first study on prompt learning with candidate labels for VLMs. We empirically demonstrate that prompt learning is more advantageous than other fine-tuning methods, for handling candidate labels. Nonetheless, its performance drops when the label ambiguity increases. In order to improve its robustness, we propose a simple yet effective framework that better leverages the prior knowledge of VLMs to guide the learning process with candidate labels. Specifically, our framework disambiguates candidate labels by aligning the model output with the mixed class posterior jointly predicted by both the learnable and the handcrafted prompt. Besides, our framework can be equipped with various off-the-shelf training objectives for learning with candidate labels to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

However, the features they learned often blend content and style information, which somewhat limits their generalization capabilities under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we adopt a causal generative perspective for multimodal data and propose contrastive learning with data augmentation to disentangle content features from the original representations. To achieve this, we begin with exploring image augmentation techniques and develop a method to seamlessly integrate them into pre-trained CLIP-like models to extract pure content features. Taking a step further, recognizing the inherent semantic richness and logical structure of text data, we explore the use of text augmentation to isolate latent content from style features. This enables CLIP-like model's encoders to concentrate on latent content information, refining the learned representations by pre-trained CLIP-like models. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks, alongside enhanced robustness to various perturbations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed methods in refining vision-language representations and advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Existing two-stage approaches involve predicting geographical coordinates and converting them into human-readable addresses, which can lead to ambiguity and be resource-intensive. In contrast, we propose an end-to-end framework named AddressCLIP to solve the problem with more semantics, consisting of two key ingredients: i) image-text alignment to align images with addresses and scene captions by contrastive learning, and ii) image-geography matching to constrain image features with the spatial distance in terms of manifold learning. Additionally, we have built three datasets from Pittsburgh and San Francisco on different scales specifically for the IAL problem. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves compelling performance on the proposed datasets and outperforms representative transfer learning methods for vision-language models. Furthermore, extensive ablations and visualizations exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, they suffer from a problem known as language prior, where responses are generated based solely on textual patterns while disregarding image information. Addressing the issue of language prior is crucial, as it can lead to undesirable biases or hallucinations when dealing with images that are out of training distribution. Despite its importance, current methods for accurately measuring language priors in LVLMs are poorly studied. Although existing benchmarks based on counterfactual or out-of-distribution images can partially be used to measure language priors, they fail to disentangle language priors from other confounding factors. To this end, we propose a new benchmark called VLind-Bench, which is the first benchmark specifically designed to measure the language priors, or blindness, of LVLMs. It not only includes tests on counterfactual images to assess language priors but also involves a series of tests to evaluate more basic capabilities such as commonsense knowledge, visual perception, and commonsense biases. For each instance in our benchmark, we ensure that all these basic tests are passed before evaluating the language priors, thereby minimizing the influence of other factors on the assessment. The evaluation and analysis of recent LVLMs in our benchmark reveal that almost all models exhibit a significant reliance on language priors, presenting a strong challenge in the field.</p></details> |  |

However, models trained on existing tasks are largely limited to turn-based interactions, where each turn must be stepped (i.e., prompted) by the user. Open-ended, asynchronous interactions where an AI model may proactively deliver timely responses or feedback based on the unfolding situation in real-time are an open challenge. In this work, we present the QEVD benchmark and dataset which explores human-AI interaction in the challenging, yet controlled, real-world domain of fitness coaching - a task which intrinsically requires monitoring live user activity and providing timely feedback. It is the first benchmark that requires assistive vision-language models to recognize complex human actions, identify mistakes grounded in those actions, and provide appropriate feedback. Our experiments reveal the limitations of existing state of the art vision-language models for such asynchronous situated interactions. Motivated by this, we propose a simple end-to-end streaming baseline that can respond asynchronously to human actions with appropriate feedbacks at the appropriate time.</p></details> | <details><summary>The b...</summary><p>The benchmark and dataset is available here: https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/ai-datasets/qevd</p></details> |

Existing methods predominantly focus on pixel-level and semantic visual features for recognition, but often overlook the deeper text-level semantic information beyond vision. Therefore, we introduce a novel fusion paradigm named image Fusion via vIsion-Language Model (FILM), for the first time, utilizing explicit textual information from source images to guide the fusion process. Specifically, FILM generates semantic prompts from images and inputs them into ChatGPT for comprehensive textual descriptions. These descriptions are fused within the textual domain and guide the visual information fusion, enhancing feature extraction and contextual understanding, directed by textual semantic information via cross-attention. FILM has shown promising results in four image fusion tasks: infrared-visible, medical, multi-exposure, and multi-focus image fusion. We also propose a vision-language dataset containing ChatGPT-generated paragraph descriptions for the eight image fusion datasets across four fusion tasks, facilitating future research in vision-language model-based image fusion.

Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly in single-page document understanding (DU). However, their abilities on long-context DU remain an open problem. This work presents MMLongBench-Doc, a long-context, multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,062 expert-annotated questions. Distinct from previous datasets, it is constructed upon 130 lengthy PDF-formatted documents with an average of 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens. Towards comprehensive evaluation, answers to these questions rely on pieces of evidence from (1) different sources (text, image, chart, table, and layout structure) and (2) various locations (i.e. page number). Moreover, 33.2% of the questions are cross-page questions requiring evidence across multiple pages. 22.8% of the questions are designed to be unanswerable for detecting potential hallucinations. Experiments on 14 LVLMs demonstrate that long-context DU greatly challenges current models. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an F1 score of only 42.7%, while the second-best, GPT-4V, scores 31.4%. Furthermore, 12 LVLMs (all except GPT-4o and GPT-4V) even present worse performance than their LLM counterparts which are fed with lossy-parsed OCR documents. These results validate the necessity of future research toward more capable long-context LVLMs. Project Page: https://mayubo2333.github.io/MMLongBench-Doc</p></details> |  |

While small models are computationally efficient, their capacity is much limited compared with large models. To break this trade-off, this paper builds a small emotional vision language model (SEVLM) by emotion modeling and input-output feature alignment. On the one hand, based on valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) knowledge annotated by psychology experts, we introduce and fuse emotional features derived through VAD dictionary and a VAD head to align VAD vectors of predicted emotion explanation and the ground truth. This allows the vision language model to better understand and generate emotional texts, compared with using traditional text embeddings alone. On the other hand, we design a contrastive head to pull close embeddings of the image, its emotion class, and explanation, which aligns model outputs and inputs. On two public affective explanation datasets, we show that the proposed techniques consistently improve the visual art understanding performance of baseline SEVLMs. Importantly, the proposed model can be trained and evaluated on a single RTX 2080 Ti while exhibiting very strong performance: it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art small models but is also competitive compared with LLaVA 7B after fine-tuning and GPT4(V).

Nevertheless, current models only focus on the visual content of a single scenario, while their ability to associate instances across different scenes has not yet been explored, which is essential for understanding complex visual content, such as movies with multiple characters and intricate plots. Towards movie understanding, a critical initial step for LVLMs is to unleash the potential of character identities memory and recognition across multiple visual scenarios. To achieve the goal, we propose visual instruction tuning with ID reference and develop an ID-Aware Large Vision-Language Model, IDA-VLM. Furthermore, our research introduces a novel benchmark MM-ID, to examine LVLMs on instance IDs memory and recognition across four dimensions: matching, location, question-answering, and captioning. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing LVLMs in recognizing and associating instance identities with ID reference. This paper paves the way for future artificial intelligence systems to possess multi-identity visual inputs, thereby facilitating the comprehension of complex visual narratives like movies.</p></details> |  |

However, such vision-language models are inherently vulnerable due to the lack of semantic meaning of the underlying embedding space. Using a recently developed gradient based optimization procedure, we demonstrate that images can be modified imperceptibly to match the representation of totally different images and unrelated texts for a vision-language model. Building on this, we develop algorithms that can adversarially modify a minimal number of images so that the robot will follow a route of choice for commands that require a number of landmarks. We demonstrate that experimentally using a recently proposed VLN system; for a given navigation command, a robot can be made to follow drastically different routes. We also develop an efficient algorithm to detect such malicious modifications reliably based on the fact that the adversarially modified images have much higher sensitivity to added Gaussian noise than the original images.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

Previous works generally focused on the alignment of image-text pairs via the contrastive pre-training paradigm. Such pre-trained models have been applied to pathology image classification in zero-shot learning or transfer learning fashion. Herein, we hypothesize that the pre-trained vision-language models can be utilized for quantitative histopathology image analysis through a simple image-to-text retrieval. To this end, we propose a Text-based Quantitative and Explainable histopathology image analysis, which we call TQx. Given a set of histopathology images, we adopt a pre-trained vision-language model to retrieve a word-of-interest pool. The retrieved words are then used to quantify the histopathology images and generate understandable feature embeddings due to the direct mapping to the text description. To evaluate the proposed method, the text-based embeddings of four histopathology image datasets are utilized to perform clustering and classification tasks. The results demonstrate that TQx is able to quantify and analyze histopathology images that are comparable to the prevalent visual models in computational pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 - Early acceptance (Top 11%)</p></details> |

This paper introduces the FlowLearn dataset, a resource tailored to enhance the understanding of flowcharts. FlowLearn contains complex scientific flowcharts and simulated flowcharts. The scientific subset contains 3,858 flowcharts sourced from scientific literature and the simulated subset contains 10,000 flowcharts created using a customizable script. The dataset is enriched with annotations for visual components, OCR, Mermaid code representation, and VQA question-answer pairs. Despite the proven capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in various visual understanding tasks, their effectiveness in decoding flowcharts - a crucial element of scientific communication - has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The FlowLearn test set is crafted to assess the performance of LVLMs in flowchart comprehension. Our study thoroughly evaluates state-of-the-art LVLMs, identifying existing limitations and establishing a foundation for future enhancements in this relatively underexplored domain. For instance, in tasks involving simulated flowcharts, GPT-4V achieved the highest accuracy (58%) in counting the number of nodes, while Claude recorded the highest accuracy (83%) in OCR tasks. Notably, no single model excels in all tasks within the FlowLearn framework, highlighting significant opportunities for further development.</p></details> | ECAI 2024 |

To address this, recent works incorporate powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to perform open-vocabulary TAL (OV-TAL). However, unlike VLMs trained on extensive image/video-text pairs, existing OV-TAL methods still rely on small, fully labeled TAL datasets for training an action localizer. In this paper, we explore the scalability of self-training with unlabeled YouTube videos for OV-TAL. Our self-training approach consists of two stages. First, a class-agnostic action localizer is trained on a human-labeled TAL dataset and used to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled videos. Second, the large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset is combined with the human-labeled dataset to train the localizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging web-scale videos in self-training significantly enhances the generalizability of an action localizer. Additionally, we highlighted issues with existing OV-TAL evaluation schemes and proposed a new evaluation protocol. Code is released at https://github.com/HYUNJS/STOV-TAL</p></details> |  |

Whereas prior studies have focused on privacy risks in single-modal models, we introduce a novel method to assess privacy for multi-modal models, specifically vision-language models like CLIP. The proposed Identity Inference Attack (IDIA) reveals whether an individual was included in the training data by querying the model with images of the same person. Letting the model choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the model reveals whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. Our large-scale experiments on CLIP demonstrate that individuals used for training can be identified with very high accuracy. We confirm that the model has learned to associate names with depicted individuals, implying the existence of sensitive information that can be extracted by adversaries. Our results highlight the need for stronger privacy protection in large-scale models and suggest that IDIAs can be used to prove the unauthorized use of data for training and to enforce privacy laws.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)</p></details> |

However, in dual-modal salient object detection (SOD) model, the robustness against noisy inputs and modality missing is crucial but rarely studied. To tackle this problem, we introduce \textbf{Co}nditional Dropout and \textbf{LA}nguage-driven(\textbf{CoLA}) framework comprising two core components. 1) Language-driven Quality Assessment (LQA): Leveraging a pretrained vision-language model with a prompt learner, the LQA recalibrates image contributions without requiring additional quality annotations. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of noisy inputs. 2) Conditional Dropout (CD): A learning method to strengthen the model's adaptability in scenarios with missing modalities, while preserving its performance under complete modalities. The CD serves as a plug-in training scheme that treats modality-missing as conditions, strengthening the overall robustness of various dual-modal SOD models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dual-modal SOD models, under both modality-complete and modality-missing conditions.

Mainstream works tackle these challenges by developing various feature aggregation methods to transform deep features into robust and compact global representations. Unfortunately, satisfactory results cannot be achieved under challenging conditions. We start from a new perspective and attempt to build a discriminative global representations by fusing image data and text descriptions of the the visual scene. The motivation is twofold: (1) Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate extraordinary emergent capability in visual instruction following, and thus provide an efficient and flexible manner in generating text descriptions of images; (2) The text descriptions, which provide high-level scene understanding, show strong robustness against environment variations. Although promising, leveraging LVLMs to build multi-modal VPR solutions remains challenging in efficient multi-modal fusion. Furthermore, LVLMs will inevitably produces some inaccurate descriptions, making it even harder. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal VPR solution. It first adapts pre-trained visual and language foundation models to VPR for extracting image and text features, which are then fed into the feature combiner to enhance each other. As the main component, the feature combiner first propose a token-wise attention block to adaptively recalibrate text tokens according to their relevance to the image data, and then develop an efficient cross-attention fusion module to propagate information across different modalities. The enhanced multi-modal features are compressed into the feature descriptor for performing retrieval. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly smaller image descriptor dimension.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Hybrid CIR (HyCIR), which uses synthetic labels to boost the performance of ZS-CIR. A new label Synthesis pipeline for CIR (SynCir) is proposed, in which only unlabeled images are required. First, image pairs are extracted based on visual similarity. Second, query text is generated for each image pair based on vision-language model and LLM. Third, the data is further filtered in language space based on semantic similarity. To improve ZS-CIR performance, we propose a hybrid training strategy to work with both ZS-CIR supervision and synthetic CIR triplets. Two kinds of contrastive learning are adopted. One is to use large-scale unlabeled image dataset to learn an image-to-text mapping with good generalization. The other is to use synthetic CIR triplets to learn a better mapping for CIR tasks. Our approach achieves SOTA zero-shot performance on the common CIR benchmarks: CIRR and CIRCO.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Single Transformer for Scalable Vision-Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06438v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SOLO, a single transformer for Scalable visiOn-Language mOdeling. Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) such as LLaVA mostly employ heterogeneous architectures that connect pre-trained visual encoders with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate visual recognition and complex reasoning. Although achieving remarkable performance with relatively lightweight training, we identify four primary scalability limitations: (1) The visual capacity is constrained by pre-trained visual encoders, which are typically an order of magnitude smaller than LLMs. (2) The heterogeneous architecture complicates the use of established hardware and software infrastructure. (3) Study of scaling laws on such architecture must consider three separate components - visual encoder, connector, and LLMs, which complicates the analysis. (4) The use of existing visual encoders typically requires following a pre-defined specification of image inputs pre-processing, for example, by reshaping inputs to fixed-resolution square images, which presents difficulties in processing and training on high-resolution images or those with unusual aspect ratio. A unified single Transformer architecture, like SOLO, effectively addresses these scalability concerns in LVLMs; however, its limited adoption in the modern context likely stems from the absence of reliable training recipes that balance both modalities and ensure stable training for billion-scale models. In this paper, we introduce the first open-source training recipe for developing SOLO, an open-source 7B LVLM using moderate academic resources. The training recipe involves initializing from LLMs, sequential pre-training on ImageNet and web-scale data, and instruction fine-tuning on our curated high-quality datasets. On extensive evaluation, SOLO demonstrates performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5-7B, particularly excelling in visual mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data are available at https://github.com/Yangyi-Chen/SOLO</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Object Hallucination in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06192v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, producing objects not present in the given images. While current benchmarks for object hallucination primarily concentrate on the presence of a single object class rather than individual entities, this work systematically investigates multi-object hallucination, examining how models misperceive (e.g., invent nonexistent objects or become distracted) when tasked with focusing on multiple objects simultaneously. We introduce Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE), an automated evaluation protocol that considers the distribution of object classes within a single image during testing and uses visual referring prompts to eliminate ambiguity. With comprehensive empirical studies and analysis of potential factors leading to multi-object hallucination, we found that (1) LVLMs suffer more hallucinations when focusing on multiple objects compared to a single object. (2) The tested object class distribution affects hallucination behaviors, indicating that LVLMs may follow shortcuts and spurious correlations.(3) Hallucinatory behaviors are influenced by data-specific factors, salience and frequency, and model intrinsic behaviors. We hope to enable LVLMs to recognize and reason about multiple objects that often occur in realistic visual scenes, provide insights, and quantify our progress towards mitigating the issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ALVR @ ACL 2024 | Project page: https://multi-object-hallucination.github.io/</p></details> |

Existing video instruction tuning datasets lack diversity as they are derived by prompting large language models with video captions to generate question-answer pairs, and are therefore mostly descriptive. Meanwhile, many labeled video datasets with diverse labels and supervision exist - however, we find that their integration into LVLMs is non-trivial. Herein, we present Video Self-Training with augmented Reasoning (Video-STaR), the first video self-training approach. Video-STaR allows the utilization of any labeled video dataset for video instruction tuning. In Video-STaR, an LVLM cycles between instruction generation and finetuning, which we show (I) improves general video understanding and (II) adapts LVLMs to novel downstream tasks with existing supervision. During generation, an LVLM is prompted to propose an answer. The answers are then filtered only to those that contain the original video labels, and the LVLM is then re-trained on the generated dataset. By only training on generated answers that contain the correct video labels, Video-STaR utilizes these existing video labels as weak supervision for video instruction tuning. Our results demonstrate that Video-STaR-enhanced LVLMs exhibit improved performance in (I) general video QA, where TempCompass performance improved by 10%, and (II) on downstream tasks, where Video-STaR improved Kinetics700-QA accuracy by 20% and action quality assessment on FineDiving by 15%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://orrzohar.github.io/projects/video-star/</p></details> |

Current evaluation datasets may not reflect diverse cultural user backgrounds or the situational context of this use case. To address this problem, we create a survey to determine caption preferences and propose a culture-centric evaluation benchmark by filtering VizWiz, an existing dataset with images taken by people who are blind. We then evaluate several VLMs, investigating their reliability as visual assistants in a culturally diverse setting. While our results for state-of-the-art models are promising, we identify challenges such as hallucination and misalignment of automatic evaluation metrics with human judgment. We make our survey, data, code, and model outputs publicly available.</p></details> | HuCLLM @ ACL 2024 |

An accident can appear in a wide variety of forms, and understanding what type of accident is taking place may be useful to prevent it from reoccurring. The task of being able to classify a traffic scene as a specific type of accident is the focus of this work. We approach the problem by likening a traffic scene to a graph, where objects such as cars can be represented as nodes, and relative distances and directions between them as edges. This representation of an accident can be referred to as a scene graph, and is used as input for an accident classifier. Better results can be obtained with a classifier that fuses the scene graph input with representations from vision and language. This work introduces a multi-stage, multimodal pipeline to pre-process videos of traffic accidents, encode them as scene graphs, and align this representation with vision and language modalities for accident classification. When trained on 4 classes, our method achieves a balanced accuracy score of 57.77% on an (unbalanced) subset of the popular Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) benchmark, representing an increase of close to 5 percentage points from the case where scene graph information is not taken into account.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted: 1st Workshop on Semantic Reasoning and Goal Understanding in Robotics, at the Robotics Science and Systems Conference (SemRob @ RSS 2024)</p></details> |

As a step toward addressing this issue, we formulate translated non-English, geographic, and socioeconomic integrated prompts and evaluate their impact on VL model performance for data from different countries and income groups. Our findings show that geographic and socioeconomic integrated prompts improve VL performance on lower-income data and favor the retrieval of topic appearances commonly found in data from low-income households. From our analyses, we identify and highlight contexts where these strategies yield the most improvements. Our model analysis code is publicly available at https://github.com/Anniejoan/Uplifting-Lower-income-data .</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs' Tuning Methods Work in Medical Multimodal Domain?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06407v2)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in world knowledge understanding, adapting them to specific subfields requires precise adjustments. Due to the model's vast scale, traditional global fine-tuning methods for large models can be computationally expensive and impact generalization. To address this challenge, a range of innovative Parameters-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged and achieved remarkable success in both LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). In the medical domain, fine-tuning a medical Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) model is essential for adapting it to specific tasks. Can the fine-tuning methods for large models be transferred to the medical field to enhance transfer learning efficiency? In this paper, we delve into the fine-tuning methods of LLMs and conduct extensive experiments to investigate the impact of fine-tuning methods for large models on the existing multimodal model in the medical domain from the training data level and the model structure level. We show the different impacts of fine-tuning methods for large models on medical VLMs and develop the most efficient ways to fine-tune medical VLP models. We hope this research can guide medical domain researchers in optimizing VLMs' training costs, fostering the broader application of VLMs in healthcare fields.

Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the model's robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, CLEVR-Change, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 85\% CIDEr points in average. By setting a new benchmark in IDC, OneDiff paves the way for more versatile and effective applications in detecting and describing visual differences. The code, models, and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explore until Confident: Efficient Exploration for Embodied Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15941v3)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of Embodied Question Answering (EQA), which refers to settings where an embodied agent such as a robot needs to actively explore an environment to gather information until it is confident about the answer to a question. In this work, we leverage the strong semantic reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) to efficiently explore and answer such questions. However, there are two main challenges when using VLMs in EQA: they do not have an internal memory for mapping the scene to be able to plan how to explore over time, and their confidence can be miscalibrated and can cause the robot to prematurely stop exploration or over-explore. We propose a method that first builds a semantic map of the scene based on depth information and via visual prompting of a VLM - leveraging its vast knowledge of relevant regions of the scene for exploration. Next, we use conformal prediction to calibrate the VLM's question answering confidence, allowing the robot to know when to stop exploration - leading to a more calibrated and efficient exploration strategy. To test our framework in simulation, we also contribute a new EQA dataset with diverse, realistic human-robot scenarios and scenes built upon the Habitat-Matterport 3D Research Dataset (HM3D). Both simulated and real robot experiments show our proposed approach improves the performance and efficiency over baselines that do no leverage VLM for exploration or do not calibrate its confidence.

| **[Benchmarking and Improving Detail Image Caption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19092v4)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning has long been regarded as a fundamental task in visual understanding. Recently, however, few large vision-language model (LVLM) research discusses model's image captioning performance because of the outdated short-caption benchmarks and unreliable evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose to benchmark detail image caption task by curating high-quality evaluation datasets annotated by human experts, GPT-4V and Gemini-1.5-Pro. We also design a more reliable caption evaluation metric called CAPTURE (CAPtion evaluation by exTracting and coUpling coRE information). CAPTURE extracts visual elements, e.g., objects, attributes and relations from captions, and then matches these elements through three stages, achieving the highest consistency with expert judgements over other rule-based or model-based caption metrics. The proposed benchmark and metric provide reliable evaluation for LVLM's detailed image captioning ability. Guided by this evaluation, we further explore to unleash LVLM's detail caption capabilities by synthesizing high-quality data through a five-stage data construction pipeline. Our pipeline only uses a given LVLM itself and other open-source tools, without any human or GPT-4V annotation in the loop. Experiments show that the proposed data construction strategy significantly improves model-generated detail caption data quality for LVLMs with leading performance, and the data quality can be further improved in a self-looping paradigm. All code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/foundation-multimodal-models/CAPTURE.</p></details> |  |

Our goal is to make real-time decisions on robot actions that are socially compliant with human expectations. We utilize a perception model to detect important social entities and prompt a VLM to generate guidance for socially compliant robot behavior. VLM-Social-Nav uses a VLM-based scoring module that computes a cost term that ensures socially appropriate and effective robot actions generated by the underlying planner. Our overall approach reduces reliance on large training datasets and enhances adaptability in decision-making. In practice, it results in improved socially compliant navigation in human-shared environments. We demonstrate and evaluate our system in four different real-world social navigation scenarios with a Turtlebot robot. We observe at least 27.38% improvement in the average success rate and 19.05% improvement in the average collision rate in the four social navigation scenarios. Our user study score shows that VLM-Social-Nav generates the most socially compliant navigation behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Interference: Retaining Pre-trained Knowledge in Parameter Efficient Continual Learning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05342v1)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses the Domain-Class Incremental Learning problem, a realistic but challenging continual learning scenario where both the domain distribution and target classes vary across tasks. To handle these diverse tasks, pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are introduced for their strong generalizability. However, this incurs a new problem: the knowledge encoded in the pre-trained VLMs may be disturbed when adapting to new tasks, compromising their inherent zero-shot ability. Existing methods tackle it by tuning VLMs with knowledge distillation on extra datasets, which demands heavy computation overhead. To address this problem efficiently, we propose the Distribution-aware Interference-free Knowledge Integration (DIKI) framework, retaining pre-trained knowledge of VLMs from a perspective of avoiding information interference. Specifically, we design a fully residual mechanism to infuse newly learned knowledge into a frozen backbone, while introducing minimal adverse impacts on pre-trained knowledge. Besides, this residual property enables our distribution-aware integration calibration scheme, explicitly controlling the information implantation process for test data from unseen distributions. Experiments demonstrate that our DIKI surpasses the current state-of-the-art approach using only 0.86% of the trained parameters and requiring substantially less training time.

| **[WorkArena++: Towards Compositional Planning and Reasoning-based Common Knowledge Work Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05291v1)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) to mimic human-like intelligence has led to a surge in LLM-based autonomous agents. Though recent LLMs seem capable of planning and reasoning given user instructions, their effectiveness in applying these capabilities for autonomous task solving remains underexplored. This is especially true in enterprise settings, where automated agents hold the promise of a high impact. To fill this gap, we propose WorkArena++, a novel benchmark consisting of 682 tasks corresponding to realistic workflows routinely performed by knowledge workers. WorkArena++ is designed to evaluate the planning, problem-solving, logical/arithmetic reasoning, retrieval, and contextual understanding abilities of web agents. Our empirical studies across state-of-the-art LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs), as well as human workers, reveal several challenges for such models to serve as useful assistants in the workplace. In addition to the benchmark, we provide a mechanism to effortlessly generate thousands of ground-truth observation/action traces, which can be used for fine-tuning existing models. Overall, we expect this work to serve as a useful resource to help the community progress toward capable autonomous agents. The benchmark can be found at https://github.com/ServiceNow/WorkArena/tree/workarena-plus-plus.</p></details> |  |

While language and vision foundation models have achieved success in handling various open-vocabulary tasks with abundant training data, OV-3DDet faces a significant challenge due to the limited availability of training data. Although some pioneering efforts have integrated vision-language models (VLM) knowledge into OV-3DDet learning, the full potential of these foundational models has yet to be fully exploited. In this paper, we unlock the textual and visual wisdom to tackle the open-vocabulary 3D detection task by leveraging the language and vision foundation models. We leverage a vision foundation model to provide image-wise guidance for discovering novel classes in 3D scenes. Specifically, we utilize a object detection vision foundation model to enable the zero-shot discovery of objects in images, which serves as the initial seeds and filtering guidance to identify novel 3D objects. Additionally, to align the 3D space with the powerful vision-language space, we introduce a hierarchical alignment approach, where the 3D feature space is aligned with the vision-language feature space using a pre-trained VLM at the instance, category, and scene levels. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and generalization, highlighting the potential of foundation models in advancing open-vocabulary 3D object detection in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[RULE: Reliable Multimodal RAG for Factuality in Medical Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05131v1)** | 2024-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent emergence of Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has enhanced medical diagnosis. However, current Med-LVLMs frequently encounter factual issues, often generating responses that do not align with established medical facts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which utilizes external knowledge, can improve the factual accuracy of these models but introduces two major challenges. First, limited retrieved contexts might not cover all necessary information, while excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant and inaccurate references, interfering with the model's generation. Second, in cases where the model originally responds correctly, applying RAG can lead to an over-reliance on retrieved contexts, resulting in incorrect answers. To address these issues, we propose RULE, which consists of two components. First, we introduce a provably effective strategy for controlling factuality risk through the calibrated selection of the number of retrieved contexts. Second, based on samples where over-reliance on retrieved contexts led to errors, we curate a preference dataset to fine-tune the model, balancing its dependence on inherent knowledge and retrieved contexts for generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RULE on three medical VQA datasets, achieving an average improvement of 20.8% in factual accuracy. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/RULE.</p></details> |  |

However, existing scaling methods enable all model parameters to be active for each token in the calculation, which brings massive training and inferring costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy MoE-Tuning for LVLMs. This strategy innovatively addresses the common issue of performance degradation in multi-modal sparsity learning, consequently constructing a sparse model with an outrageous number of parameters but a constant computational cost. Furthermore, we present the MoE-LLaVA, a MoE-based sparse LVLM architecture, which uniquely activates only the top-k experts through routers during deployment, keeping the remaining experts inactive. Extensive experiments show the significant performance of MoE-LLaVA in a variety of visual understanding and object hallucination benchmarks. Remarkably, with only approximately 3B sparsely activated parameters, MoE-LLaVA demonstrates performance comparable to the LLaVA-1.5-7B on various visual understanding datasets and even surpasses the LLaVA-1.5-13B in object hallucination benchmark. Through MoE-LLaVA, we aim to establish a baseline for sparse LVLMs and provide valuable insights for future research in developing more efficient and effective multi-modal learning systems.

As these models are widely deployed in consumer applications, they could lead to new privacy risks due to emergent abilities to identify people in photos, geolocate images, etc. As we demonstrate, somewhat surprisingly, current open-source and proprietary VLMs are very capable image geolocators, making widespread geolocation with VLMs an immediate privacy risk, rather than merely a theoretical future concern. As a first step to address this challenge, we develop a new benchmark, GPTGeoChat, to test the ability of VLMs to moderate geolocation dialogues with users. We collect a set of 1,000 image geolocation conversations between in-house annotators and GPT-4v, which are annotated with the granularity of location information revealed at each turn. Using this new dataset, we evaluate the ability of various VLMs to moderate GPT-4v geolocation conversations by determining when too much location information has been revealed. We find that custom fine-tuned models perform on par with prompted API-based models when identifying leaked location information at the country or city level; however, fine-tuning on supervised data appears to be needed to accurately moderate finer granularities, such as the name of a restaurant or building.</p></details> |  |

However, we often fail to fully unleash their potential when adapting them for new concept understanding due to limited information on new classes. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel adaptation framework, AWT (Augment, Weight, then Transport). AWT comprises three key components: augmenting inputs with diverse visual perspectives and enriched class descriptions through image transformations and language models; dynamically weighting inputs based on the prediction entropy; and employing optimal transport to mine semantic correlations in the vision-language space. AWT can be seamlessly integrated into various VLMs, enhancing their zero-shot capabilities without additional training and facilitating few-shot learning through an integrated multimodal adapter module. We verify AWT in multiple challenging scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot image classification, zero-shot video action recognition, and out-of-distribution generalization. AWT consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in each setting. In addition, our extensive studies further demonstrate AWT's effectiveness and adaptability across different VLMs, architectures, and scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dude: Dual Distribution-Aware Context Prompt Learning For Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04489v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning methods are gaining increasing attention due to their ability to customize large vision-language models to new domains using pre-trained contextual knowledge and minimal training data. However, existing works typically rely on optimizing unified prompt inputs, often struggling with fine-grained classification tasks due to insufficient discriminative attributes. To tackle this, we consider a new framework based on a dual context of both domain-shared and class-specific contexts, where the latter is generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPTs. Such dual prompt methods enhance the model's feature representation by joining implicit and explicit factors encoded in LLM knowledge. Moreover, we formulate the Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) theory to quantify the relationships between constructed prompts and visual tokens. Through partial matching, UOT can properly align discrete sets of visual tokens and prompt embeddings under different mass distributions, which is particularly valuable for handling irrelevant or noisy elements, ensuring that the preservation of mass does not restrict transport solutions. Furthermore, UOT's characteristics integrate seamlessly with image augmentation, expanding the training sample pool while maintaining a reasonable distance between perturbed images and prompt inputs. Extensive experiments across few-shot classification and adapter settings substantiate the superiority of our model over current state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | Version 1 |

Current models that claim to perform multi-modal state tracking fall short of two major aspects: (1) They either track only one modality (mostly the visual input) or (2) they target synthetic datasets that do not reflect the complexity of real-world in the wild scenarios. Our model addresses these two limitations in an attempt to close this crucial research gap. Specifically, MST-MIXER first tracks the most important constituents of each input modality. Then, it predicts the missing underlying structure of the selected constituents of each modality by learning local latent graphs using a novel multi-modal graph structure learning method. Subsequently, the learned local graphs and features are parsed together to form a global graph operating on the mix of all modalities which further refines its structure and node embeddings. Finally, the fine-grained graph node features are used to enhance the hidden states of the backbone Vision-Language Model (VLM). MST-MIXER achieves new state-of-the-art results on five challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

The ability to form abstractions underlies mathematical reasoning, problem-solving, and other Math AI tasks. Several formalisms have been given to these underlying abstractions and skills utilized by humans and intelligent systems for reasoning. Furthermore, human reasoning is inherently multimodal, and as such, we focus our investigations on multimodal AI. In this article, we employ the abstractions given in the SMART task (Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task) introduced in \cite{cherian2022deep} as meta-reasoning and problem-solving skills along eight axes: math, counting, path, measure, logic, spatial, and pattern. We investigate the ability of vision-language models to reason along these axes and seek avenues of improvement. Including composite representations with vision-language cross-attention enabled learning multimodal representations adaptively from fused frozen pretrained backbones for better visual grounding. Furthermore, proper hyperparameter and other training choices led to strong improvements (up to $48\%$ gain in accuracy) on the SMART task, further underscoring the power of deep multimodal learning. The smartest VLM, which includes a novel QF multimodal layer, improves upon the best previous baselines in every one of the eight fundamental reasoning skills.

In contrast to single-arm manipulation, bimanual manipulation tasks are challenging due to higher-dimensional action spaces. Prior works leverage large amounts of data and primitive actions to address this problem, but may suffer from sample inefficiency and limited generalization across various tasks. To this end, we propose VoxAct-B, a language-conditioned, voxel-based method that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to prioritize key regions within the scene and reconstruct a voxel grid. We provide this voxel grid to our bimanual manipulation policy to learn acting and stabilizing actions. This approach enables more efficient policy learning from voxels and is generalizable to different tasks.

However, they often come at the cost of flexibility and adaptability when the tuned models are applied to different datasets or domains. In this paper, we explore capturing the task-specific information via meticulous refinement of entire VLMs, with minimal parameter adjustments. When fine-tuning the entire VLMs for specific tasks under limited supervision, overfitting and catastrophic forgetting become the defacto factors. To mitigate these issues, we propose a framework named CLIP-CITE via designing a discriminative visual-text task, further aligning the visual-text semantics in a supervision manner, and integrating knowledge distillation techniques to preserve the gained knowledge. Extensive experimental results under few-shot learning, base-to-new generalization, domain generalization, and cross-domain generalization settings, demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the performance on specific tasks under limited supervision while preserving the versatility of the VLMs on other datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Concept Bottleneck Models Without Predefined Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03921v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been considerable recent interest in interpretable concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict human-interpretable concepts and then map them to output classes. To reduce reliance on human-annotated concepts, recent works have converted pretrained black-box models into interpretable CBMs post-hoc. However, these approaches predefine a set of concepts, assuming which concepts a black-box model encodes in its representations. In this work, we eliminate this assumption by leveraging unsupervised concept discovery to automatically extract concepts without human annotations or a predefined set of concepts. We further introduce an input-dependent concept selection mechanism that ensures only a small subset of concepts is used across all classes. We show that our approach improves downstream performance and narrows the performance gap to black-box models, while using significantly fewer concepts in the classification. Finally, we demonstrate how large vision-language models can intervene on the final model weights to correct model errors.</p></details> |  |

However, video-text pairs in previous data typically do not align perfectly with each other, which might lead to video-language representations that do not accurately reflect cross-modal semantics. Moreover, previous data also possess an uneven distribution of concepts, thereby hampering the downstream performance across unpopular subjects. To address these problems, we propose a contrastive objective with a subtractive angular margin to regularize cross-modal representations in their effort to reach perfect similarity. Furthermore, to adapt to the non-uniform concept distribution, we propose a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-parameterized weighting function that maps loss values to sample weights which enable dynamic adjustment of the model's focus throughout the training. With the training guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data and augmented by video-text data generated by large vision-language model, we improve video-language representations and achieve superior performances on commonly used video question answering and text-video retrieval datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Many works have explored the utilization of pre-trained VLM for the challenging open-vocabulary dense prediction task that requires perceiving diverse objects with novel classes at inference time. Existing methods construct experiments based on the public datasets of related tasks, which are not tailored for open vocabulary and rarely involve imperceptible objects camouflaged in complex scenes due to data collection bias and annotation costs. To fill in the gaps, we introduce a new task, open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation (OVCOS), and construct a large-scale complex scene dataset (\textbf{OVCamo}) containing 11,483 hand-selected images with fine annotations and corresponding object classes. Further, we build a strong single-stage open-vocabulary \underline{c}amouflaged \underline{o}bject \underline{s}egmentation transform\underline{er} baseline \textbf{OVCoser} attached to the parameter-fixed CLIP with iterative semantic guidance and structure enhancement. By integrating the guidance of class semantic knowledge and the supplement of visual structure cues from the edge and depth information, the proposed method can efficiently capture camouflaged objects. Moreover, this effective framework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of open-vocabulary semantic image segmentation by a large margin on our OVCamo dataset. With the proposed dataset and baseline, we hope that this new task with more practical value can further expand the research on open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks.

We introduce ScreenAI, a vision-language model that specializes in UI and infographics understanding. Our model improves upon the PaLI architecture with the flexible patching strategy of pix2struct and is trained on a unique mixture of datasets. At the heart of this mixture is a novel screen annotation task in which the model has to identify the type and location of UI elements. We use these text annotations to describe screens to Large Language Models and automatically generate question-answering (QA), UI navigation, and summarization training datasets at scale. We run ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of these design choices. At only 5B parameters, ScreenAI achieves new state-of-the-artresults on UI- and infographics-based tasks (Multi-page DocVQA, WebSRC, MoTIF and Widget Captioning), and new best-in-class performance on others (Chart QA, DocVQA, and InfographicVQA) compared to models of similar size.

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (1 expert). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical imaging: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures DISTS, FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that the additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPU-Based Parallel Computing Methods for Medical Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10928v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement in GPU technology, establishing it as a formidable high-performance parallel computing technology with superior floating-point computational capabilities compared to traditional CPUs. This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Photoacoustic image synthesis with generative adversarial networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15510v3)** | 2022-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has the potential to recover morphological and functional tissue properties with high spatial resolution. However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |
| **[Fourier Neural Operator Networks: A Fast and General Solver for the Photoacoustic Wave Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09374v1)** | 2021-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation tools for photoacoustic wave propagation have played a key role in advancing photoacoustic imaging by providing quantitative and qualitative insights into parameters affecting image quality. Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Deep neural networks have great potential in medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnosis and other healthcare issues, and is promoted in both pre-clinical and even clinical stages. In this review, we performed an overview of some new developments and challenges in the application of machine learning to medical image analysis, with a special focus on deep learning in photoacoustic imaging.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods.

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible to surpass the acoustic diffraction limit by analyzing fluctuations in a set of photoacoustic images obtained under unknown speckle illumination patterns. Here, we purpose an approach to boost reconstruction fidelity and resolution, while reducing the number of acquired images by utilizing a compressed sensing computational reconstruction framework. The approach takes into account prior knowledge of the system response and sparsity of the target structure. We provide proof of principle experiments of the approach and demonstrate that improved performance is obtained when both speckle fluctuations and object priors are used. We numerically study the expected performance as a function of the measurements signal to noise ratio and sample spatial-sparsity. The presented reconstruction framework can be applied to analyze existing photoacoustic experimental datasets containing dynamic fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

Here we address the question of how to fine-tune such systems to improve their performance. We cast this as a problem of optimizing the underlying LM weights and the prompting strategies together, and consider a challenging but highly realistic scenario in which we have no gold labels for any intermediate stages in the pipeline. To address this challenge, we evaluate approximate optimization strategies in which we bootstrap training labels for all pipeline stages and use these to optimize the pipeline's prompts and fine-tune its weights alternatingly. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification, we find that simple approaches for optimizing the prompts and weights together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 65% and 5%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks. We will release our new optimizers in DSPy at http://dspy.ai</p></details> |  |

However, no inquiry has yet been made on the impact of prompt selection on labelling accuracy. In this study, we show that performance greatly varies between prompts, and we apply the method of automatic prompt optimization to systematically craft high quality prompts.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024)</p></details> |

While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

We worked with the domain experts of SAP SE to develop an HR support chatbot as an efficient and effective tool for addressing employee inquiries. We inserted a human-in-the-loop in various parts of the development cycles such as dataset collection, prompt optimization, and evaluation of generated output. By enhancing the LLM-driven chatbot's response quality and exploring alternative retrieval methods, we have created an efficient, scalable, and flexible tool for HR professionals to address employee inquiries effectively. Our experiments and evaluation conclude that GPT-4 outperforms other models and can overcome inconsistencies in data through internal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, through expert analysis, we infer that reference-free evaluation metrics such as G-Eval and Prometheus demonstrate reliability closely aligned with that of human evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |

The existing research primarily emphasizes the importance of adapting prompts to specific tasks, rather than specific LLMs. However, a good prompt is not solely defined by its wording, but also binds to the nature of the LLM in question. In this work, we first quantitatively demonstrate that different prompts should be adapted to different LLMs to enhance their capabilities across various downstream tasks in NLP. Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively refine prompts for an LLM, leading to significant improvements over various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2023 (Findings)</p></details> |

The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08364v3)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization.

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |

In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |

This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concentrate Attention: Towards Domain-Generalizable Prompt Optimization for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10584v3)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in prompt optimization have notably enhanced the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks. However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2024, Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

| **[Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10443v2)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-free Prompted Based Anomaly Detection: prompt optimization with Meta-guiding prompt scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18197v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) are highly adaptable to various downstream tasks through few-shot learning, making prompt-based anomaly detection a promising approach. Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16743v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace is the New AutoDiff -- Unlocking Efficient Optimization of Computational Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16218v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. We propose an end-to-end optimization framework, Trace, which treats the computational workflow of an AI system as a graph akin to neural networks, based on a generalization of back-propagation. Optimization of computational workflows often involves rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, hyper-parameters, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). Moreover, its computation graph can change dynamically with the inputs and parameters. We frame a new mathematical setup of iterative optimization, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), to capture and abstract these properties so as to design optimizers that work across many domains. In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. Trace is the tool to implement OPTO in practice. Trace has a Python interface that efficiently converts a computational workflow into an OPTO instance using a PyTorch-like interface. Using Trace, we develop a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime that can effectively solve OPTO problems. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We believe that Trace, OptoPrime and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar selection, ES). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO recently receiving more research attention. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and ES techniques, both isolation and combination, on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars consistently improves performance over IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with ES strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe synergy between ES and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar selection as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remains a crucial aspect of APO and deserves greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO.

Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches make light of the importance of high-quality prompt initialization and the identification of effective optimization directions, thus resulting in substantial optimization steps to obtain satisfactory performance. In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> |  |

In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel optimizer that outperforms baselines on five of six diverse LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 12.9% accuracy.

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table (12 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PROMST that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and three testing models.

| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights. The effectiveness and efficiency of our system are validated through two case studies and interviews with experts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[POS: A Prompts Optimization Suite for Augmenting Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00949v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper targets to enhance the diffusion-based text-to-video generation by improving the two input prompts, including the noise and the text. Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Central to their success is the concept of prompting, which guides model output generation. However, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic, synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. PromptWizard offers several key features and capabilities, including computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, adaptability to scenarios with varying amounts of training data, and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizard's superiority over existing prompt strategies, showcasing its efficacy and scalability in prompt optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |

Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuanWu/EASE-Prompt-Optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 1 figure, 23 tables</p></details> |

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |

However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p></details> | WWW 2024 Companion |

Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts. The reward function during training encourages the model to consider aesthetic score, semantic consistency, and user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively improves the original prompts, generating visually more appealing images while maintaining semantic alignment.

However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference. It demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot question-answering datasets: GSM8K, MultiArith, and AQuA.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Efficient Prompting Methods for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01077v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has become a mainstream paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific natural language processing tasks. While this approach opens the door to in-context learning of LLMs, it brings the additional computational burden of model inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.</p></details> |  |

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

Our work addresses the inherent limitations of conventional single-prompt learning methods that often lead to overfitting due to the inability to generalize across varying contexts in real-world videos. Recognizing the diversity of camera views, backgrounds, and objects in videos, we propose a multi-prompt learning framework enhanced with optimal transport. This design allows the model to learn a set of diverse prompts for each action, capturing general characteristics more effectively and distributing the representation to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, by employing optimal transport theory, we efficiently align these prompts with action features, optimizing for a comprehensive representation that adapts to the multifaceted nature of video data. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in action localization accuracy and robustness in few-shot settings on the standard challenging datasets of THUMOS-14 and EpicKitchens100, highlighting the efficacy of our multi-prompt optimal transport approach in overcoming the challenges of conventional few-shot TAL methods.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17804v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

One approach is to treat these models as black boxes and use forward passes (Inference APIs) to interact with them. Current research focuses on adapting these black-box models to downstream tasks using gradient-free prompt optimization, but this often involves an expensive process of searching task-specific prompts. Therefore, we are motivated to study black-box language model adaptation without prompt search. Specifically, we introduce a label-enhanced cross-attention network called CrossTune, which models the semantic relatedness between the input text sequence and task-specific label descriptions. Its effectiveness is examined in the context of few-shot text classification. To improve the generalization of CrossTune, we utilize ChatGPT to generate additional training data through in-context learning. A switch mechanism is implemented to exclude low-quality ChatGPT-generated data. Through extensive experiments on seven benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art gradient-free black-box tuning method by 5.7% on average. Even without using ChatGPT-augmented data, CrossTune performs better or comparably than previous black-box tuning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-Coling 2024</p></details> |

However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts.

| **[Harnessing Multi-Role Capabilities of Large Language Models for Open-Domain Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05217v1)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has emerged as a pivotal research spotlight in information systems. Existing methods follow two main paradigms to collect evidence: (1) The \textit{retrieve-then-read} paradigm retrieves pertinent documents from an external corpus; and (2) the \textit{generate-then-read} paradigm employs large language models (LLMs) to generate relevant documents. However, neither can fully address multifaceted requirements for evidence. To this end, we propose LLMQA, a generalized framework that formulates the ODQA process into three basic steps: query expansion, document selection, and answer generation, combining the superiority of both retrieval-based and generation-based evidence. Since LLMs exhibit their excellent capabilities to accomplish various tasks, we instruct LLMs to play multiple roles as generators, rerankers, and evaluators within our framework, integrating them to collaborate in the ODQA process. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt optimization algorithm to refine role-playing prompts and steer LLMs to produce higher-quality evidence and answers. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks (NQ, WebQ, and TriviaQA) demonstrate that LLMQA achieves the best performance in terms of both answer accuracy and evidence quality, showcasing its potential for advancing ODQA research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>TheWe...</summary><p>TheWebConf 2024 (WWW 2024) oral, code repo: https://github.com/EthanLeo-LYX/LLMQA</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce ConstitutionalExperts, a method for learning a prompt consisting of constitutional principles (i.e. rules), given a training dataset. Unlike prior methods that optimize the prompt as a single entity, our method incrementally improves the prompt by surgically editing individual principles. We also show that we can improve overall performance by learning unique prompts for different semantic regions of the training data and using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to route inputs at inference time. We compare our method to other state of the art prompt-optimization techniques across six benchmark datasets. We also investigate whether MoE improves these other techniques. Our results suggest that ConstitutionalExperts outperforms other prompt optimization techniques by 10.9% (F1) and that mixture-of-experts improves all techniques, suggesting its broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Dependent Prompt Evaluation and Optimization with Offline Inverse RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06553v4)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we aim to enhance the arithmetic reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through zero-shot prompt optimization. We identify a previously overlooked objective of query dependency in such optimization and elucidate two ensuing challenges that impede the successful and economical design of prompt optimization techniques. One primary issue is the absence of an effective method to evaluate prompts during inference when the golden answer is unavailable. Concurrently, learning via interactions with the LLMs to navigate the expansive natural language prompting space proves to be resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce Prompt-OIRL, which harnesses offline inverse reinforcement learning to draw insights from offline prompting demonstration data. Such data exists as by-products when diverse prompts are benchmarked on open-accessible datasets. With Prompt-OIRL, the query-dependent prompt optimization objective is achieved by first learning an offline reward model. This model can evaluate any query-prompt pairs without accessing LLMs. Subsequently, a best-of-N strategy is deployed to recommend the optimal prompt. Our experimental evaluations across various LLM scales and arithmetic reasoning datasets underscore both the efficacy and economic viability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02993v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating natural language has aroused a wide interest in developing prompt-based methods to harness the power of black-box LLMs. Existing methodologies usually prioritize a global optimization for finding the global optimum, which however will perform poorly in certain tasks. This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimization (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connecting Large Language Models with Evolutionary Algorithms Yields Powerful Prompt Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08532v2)** | 2024-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |

However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating "positive thinking" into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of "positive thinking" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best "positive thinking" prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.</p></details> |  |

Although existing prompt engineering methods can provide high-level guidance, it is challenging for novice users to achieve the desired results by manually entering prompts due to a discrepancy between novice-user-input prompts and the model-preferred prompts. To bridge the distribution gap between user input behavior and model training datasets, we first construct a novel Coarse-Fine Granularity Prompts dataset (CFP) and propose a novel User-Friendly Fine-Grained Text Generation framework (UF-FGTG) for automated prompt optimization. For CFP, we construct a novel dataset for text-to-image tasks that combines coarse and fine-grained prompts to facilitate the development of automated prompt generation methods. For UF-FGTG, we propose a novel framework that automatically translates user-input prompts into model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we propose a prompt refiner that continually rewrites prompts to empower users to select results that align with their unique needs. Meanwhile, we integrate image-related loss functions from the text-to-image model into the training process of text generation to generate model-preferred prompts. Additionally, we propose an adaptive feature extraction module to ensure diversity in the generated results. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of generating more visually appealing and diverse images than previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 5% across six quality and aesthetic metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024)</p></details> |
| **[MORL-Prompt: An Empirical Analysis of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Discrete Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11711v1)** | 2024-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RL-based techniques can be used to search for prompts that when fed into a target language model maximize a set of user-specified reward functions. However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we adapt several techniques for multi-objective optimization to RL-based discrete prompt optimization -- two that consider volume of the Pareto reward surface, and another that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We conduct an empirical analysis of these methods on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize volume perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |

Existing work treats the optimization of prompt instruction and in-context learning examples as distinct problems, leading to sub-optimal prompt performance. This research addresses this limitation by establishing a unified in-context prompt optimization framework, which aims to achieve joint optimization of the prompt instruction and examples. However, formulating such optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional natural language space introduces challenges in terms of convergence and computational efficiency. To overcome these issues, we present PhaseEvo, an efficient automatic prompt optimization framework that combines the generative capability of LLMs with the global search proficiency of evolution algorithms. Our framework features a multi-phase design incorporating innovative LLM-based mutation operators to enhance search efficiency and accelerate convergence. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our approach across 35 benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that PhaseEvo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods by a large margin whilst maintaining good efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 9 figures, 26 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Rewrite Prompts for Personalized Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00152v2)** | 2024-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facilitated by large language models (LLMs), personalized text generation has become a rapidly growing research direction. Most existing studies focus on designing specialized models for a particular domain, or they require fine-tuning the LLMs to generate personalized text. We consider a typical scenario in which the large language model, which generates personalized output, is frozen and can only be accessed through APIs. Under this constraint, all one can do is to improve the input text (i.e., text prompts) sent to the LLM, a procedure that is usually done manually. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically revise prompts for personalized text generation. The proposed method takes the initial prompts generated by a state-of-the-art, multistage framework for personalized generation and rewrites a few critical components that summarize and synthesize the personal context. The prompt rewriter employs a training paradigm that chains together supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL), where SL reduces the search space of RL and RL facilitates end-to-end training of the rewriter. Using datasets from three representative domains, we demonstrate that the rewritten prompts outperform both the original prompts and the prompts optimized via supervised learning or reinforcement learning alone. In-depth analysis of the rewritten prompts shows that they are not only human readable, but also able to guide manual revision of prompts when there is limited resource to employ reinforcement learning to train the prompt rewriter, or when it is costly to deploy an automatic prompt rewriter for inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |
| **[Intent-based Prompt Calibration: Enhancing prompt optimization with synthetic boundary cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03099v1)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a challenging and important task due to the high sensitivity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the given prompt and the inherent ambiguity of a textual task instruction. Automatic prompt engineering is essential to achieve optimized performance from LLMs. Recent studies have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs to automatically conduct prompt engineering by employing a meta-prompt that incorporates the outcomes of the last trials and proposes an improved prompt. However, this requires a high-quality benchmark to compare different prompts, which is difficult and expensive to acquire in many real-world use cases. In this work, we introduce a new method for automatic prompt engineering, using a calibration process that iteratively refines the prompt to the user intent. During the optimization process, the system jointly generates synthetic data of boundary use cases and optimizes the prompt according to the generated dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with respect to strong proprietary models on real-world tasks such as moderation and generation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a limited number of annotated samples. Furthermore, we validate the advantages of each one of the system's key components. Our system is built in a modular way, facilitating easy adaptation to other tasks. The code is available $\href{https://github.com/Eladlev/AutoPrompt}{here}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models Against Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13954v3)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant ability in various Natural Language Processing tasks. However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on the phrasing of the task prompt, leading to research on automatic prompt optimization using labeled task data. We reveal that these prompt optimization techniques are vulnerable to distribution shifts such as subpopulation shifts, which are common for LLMs in real-world scenarios such as customer reviews analysis. In this light, we propose a new problem of robust prompt optimization for LLMs against distribution shifts, which requires the prompt optimized over the labeled source group can simultaneously generalize to an unlabeled target group. To solve this problem, we propose Generalized Prompt Optimization framework, which incorporates the unlabeled data from the target group into prompt optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with significant performance improvement on the target group and comparable performance on the source group.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 Main |
| **[GLaPE: Gold Label-agnostic Prompt Evaluation and Optimization for Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02408v1)** | 2024-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), their task performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/thunderous77/GLaPE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Good Prompt Optimizers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02101v1)** | 2024-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based Automatic Prompt Optimization, which typically utilizes LLMs as Prompt Optimizers to self-reflect and refine prompts, has shown promising performance in recent studies. Despite the success, the underlying mechanism of this approach remains unexplored, and the true effectiveness of LLMs as Prompt Optimizers requires further validation. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study to uncover the actual mechanism of LLM-based Prompt Optimization. Our findings reveal that the LLM optimizers struggle to identify the true causes of errors during reflection, tending to be biased by their own prior knowledge rather than genuinely reflecting on the errors. Furthermore, even when the reflection is semantically valid, the LLM optimizers often fail to generate appropriate prompts for the target models with a single prompt refinement step, partly due to the unpredictable behaviors of the target models. Based on the observations, we introduce a new "Automatic Behavior Optimization" paradigm, which directly optimizes the target model's behavior in a more controllable manner. We hope our study can inspire new directions for automatic prompt optimization development.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods heavily rely on per-prompt optimization when handling natural language as editing instructions. Due to the lack of labeled human face 3D datasets and effective architectures, the area of human-instructed 3D-aware editing for open-world portraits in an end-to-end manner remains under-explored. To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end diffusion-based framework termed InstructPix2NeRF, which enables instructed 3D-aware portrait editing from a single open-world image with human instructions. At its core lies a conditional latent 3D diffusion process that lifts 2D editing to 3D space by learning the correlation between the paired images' difference and the instructions via triplet data. With the help of our proposed token position randomization strategy, we could even achieve multi-semantic editing through one single pass with the portrait identity well-preserved. Besides, we further propose an identity consistency module that directly modulates the extracted identity signals into our diffusion process, which increases the multi-view 3D identity consistency. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and show its superiority against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively.

Through extensive experiments on various prompt benchmarks, AToM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art amortized approaches with over 4 times higher accuracy (in DF415 dataset) and produces more distinguishable and higher-quality 3D outputs. AToM demonstrates strong generalizability, offering finegrained 3D assets for unseen interpolated prompts without further optimization during inference, unlike per-prompt solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages with appendix and references.

However, dreaming has not been successfully applied to language models because the input space is discrete. We extend Greedy Coordinate Gradient, a method from the language model adversarial attack literature, to design the Evolutionary Prompt Optimization (EPO) algorithm. EPO optimizes the input prompt to simultaneously maximize the Pareto frontier between a chosen internal feature and prompt fluency, enabling fluent dreaming for language models. We demonstrate dreaming with neurons, output logits and arbitrary directions in activation space. We measure the fluency of the resulting prompts and compare language model dreaming with max-activating dataset examples. Critically, fluent dreaming allows automatically exploring the behavior of model internals in reaction to mildly out-of-distribution prompts.

However, prior discrete prompt optimization methods require expert knowledge to design the base prompt set and identify high-quality prompts, which is costly, inefficient, and subjective. Meanwhile, existing continuous prompt optimization methods improve the performance by learning the ideal prompts through the gradient information of PLMs, whose high computational cost, and low readability and generalizability are often concerning. To address the research gap, we propose a Dialogue-comprised Policy-gradient-based Discrete Prompt Optimization ($DP_2O$) method. We first design a multi-round dialogue alignment strategy for readability prompt set generation based on GPT-4. Furthermore, we propose an efficient prompt screening metric to identify high-quality prompts with linear complexity. Finally, we construct a reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on policy gradients to match the prompts to inputs optimally. By training a policy network with only 0.67% of the PLM parameter size on the tasks in the few-shot setting, $DP_2O$ outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.52% in accuracy on average on four open-source datasets. Moreover, subsequent experiments also demonstrate that $DP_2O$ has good universality, robustness, and generalization ability.</p></details> | AAAI 2024 Main Track |

Typically, they learn a very small scale of parameters for pre-trained models in a white-box formulation, which assumes model architectures to be known and parameters to be accessible. However, large models are often not open-source due to considerations of preventing abuse or commercial factors, hence posing a barrier to the deployment of white-box PEFT methods. To alleviate the dependence on model accessibility, we introduce collaborative black-box tuning (CBBT) for both textual prompt optimization and output feature adaptation for black-box models. Specifically, considering that the backpropagation gradients are blocked, we approximate the gradients of textual prompts by analyzing the predictions with perturbed prompts. Secondly, a lightweight adapter is deployed over the output feature of the inaccessible model, further facilitating the model adaptation process. Empowered with these designs, our CBBT is extensively evaluated on eleven downstream benchmarks and achieves remarkable improvements compared to existing black-box VL adaptation methods.

Specifically, we explicitly construct a unified framework to harmonize diverse inputs from multiple pretraining tasks by leveraging cross-modal prompts for unification, which accordingly can accommodate heterogeneous medical fine-tuning tasks. Furthermore, we conceive a dynamic cross-modal prompt optimizing strategy that optimizes the prompts within the shareable space for implicitly processing the shareable clinic knowledge. UniDCP is the first Med-VLP model capable of performing all 8 medical uni-modal and cross-modal tasks over 14 corresponding datasets, consistently yielding superior results over diverse state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, automating the generation of such expert-level prompts remains elusive. Existing prompt optimization methods tend to overlook the depth of domain knowledge and struggle to efficiently explore the vast space of expert-level prompts. Addressing this, we present PromptAgent, an optimization method that autonomously crafts prompts equivalent in quality to those handcrafted by experts. At its core, PromptAgent views prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem and employs a principled planning algorithm, rooted in Monte Carlo tree search, to strategically navigate the expert-level prompt space. Inspired by human-like trial-and-error exploration, PromptAgent induces precise expert-level insights and in-depth instructions by reflecting on model errors and generating constructive error feedback. Such a novel framework allows the agent to iteratively examine intermediate prompts (states), refine them based on error feedbacks (actions), simulate future rewards, and search for high-reward paths leading to expert prompts. We apply PromptAgent to 12 tasks spanning three practical domains: BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), as well as domain-specific and general NLP tasks, showing it significantly outperforms strong Chain-of-Thought and recent prompt optimization baselines. Extensive analyses emphasize its capability to craft expert-level, detailed, and domain-insightful prompts with great efficiency and generalizability.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |

Traditional approaches, however, face limitations due to their presumption of a uniform number of intents across all sessions. This assumption overlooks the dynamic nature of user sessions, where the number and type of intentions can significantly vary. In addition, these methods typically operate in latent spaces, thus hinder the model's transparency.Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel ISR approach, utilizing the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). First, this approach begins by generating an initial prompt that guides LLMs to predict the next item in a session, based on the varied intents manifested in user sessions. Then, to refine this process, we introduce an innovative prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively self-reflects and adjusts prompts. Furthermore, our prompt selection module, built upon the LLMs' broad adaptability, swiftly selects the most optimized prompts across diverse domains. This new paradigm empowers LLMs to discern diverse user intents at a semantic level, leading to more accurate and interpretable session recommendations. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, marking a significant advancement in ISR systems.</p></details> |  |

A Survey on Factual Knowledge Probing in Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16570v2)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on vast unlabeled data, rich in world knowledge. This fact has sparked the interest of the community in quantifying the amount of factual knowledge present in PLMs, as this explains their performance on downstream tasks, and potentially justifies their use as knowledge bases. In this work, we survey methods and datasets that are used to probe PLMs for factual knowledge. Our contributions are: (1) We propose a categorization scheme for factual probing methods that is based on how their inputs, outputs and the probed PLMs are adapted; (2) We provide an overview of the datasets used for factual probing; (3) We synthesize insights about knowledge retention and prompt optimization in PLMs, analyze obstacles to adopting PLMs as knowledge bases and outline directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP Findings 2023</p></details> |
| **[Joint Prompt Optimization of Stacked LLMs using Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12509v2)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can be seen as atomic units of computation mapping sequences to a distribution over sequences. Thus, they can be seen as stochastic language layers in a language network, where the learnable parameters are the natural language prompts at each layer. By stacking two such layers and feeding the output of one layer to the next, we obtain a Deep Language Network (DLN). We first show how to effectively perform prompt optimization for a 1-Layer language network (DLN-1). Then, we present an extension that applies to 2-layer DLNs (DLN-2), where two prompts must be learned. The key idea is to consider the output of the first layer as a latent variable, which requires inference, and prompts to be learned as the parameters of the generative distribution. We first test the effectiveness of DLN-1 in multiple reasoning and natural language understanding tasks. Then, we show that DLN-2 can reach higher performance than a single layer, showing promise that we might reach comparable performance to GPT-4, even when each LLM in the network is smaller and less powerful.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2023 |
| **[A Bayesian approach for prompt optimization in pre-trained language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00471v1)** | 2023-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prompt is a sequence of symbol or tokens, selected from a vocabulary according to some rule, which is prepended/concatenated to a textual query. A key problem is how to select the sequence of tokens: in this paper we formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem. The high dimensionality of the token space com-pounded by the length of the prompt sequence requires a very efficient solution. In this paper we propose a Bayesian optimization method, executed in a continuous em-bedding of the combinatorial space. In this paper we focus on hard prompt tuning (HPT) which directly searches for discrete tokens to be added to the text input with-out requiring access to the large language model (LLM) and can be used also when LLM is available only as a black-box. This is critically important if LLMs are made available in the Model as a Service (MaaS) manner as in GPT-4. The current manu-script is focused on the optimization of discrete prompts for classification tasks. The discrete prompts give rise to difficult combinatorial optimization problem which easily become intractable given the dimension of the token space in realistic applications. The optimization method considered in this paper is Bayesian optimization (BO) which has become the dominant approach in black-box optimization for its sample efficiency along with its modular structure and versatility. In this paper we use BoTorch, a library for Bayesian optimization research built on top of pyTorch. Albeit preliminary and obtained using a 'vanilla' version of BO, the experiments on RoB-ERTa on six benchmarks, show a good performance across a variety of tasks and enable an analysis of the tradeoff between size of the search space, accuracy and wall clock time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Mobile-Edge AI-Generated Everything (AIGX) Services by Prompt Engineering: Fundamental, Framework, and Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01065v2)** | 2023-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the next-generation paradigm for content creation, AI-Generated Content (AIGC), i.e., generating content automatically by Generative AI (GAI) based on user prompts, has gained great attention and success recently. With the ever-increasing power of GAI, especially the emergence of Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) that contain billions of parameters and prompt engineering methods (i.e., finding the best prompts for the given task), the application range of AIGC is rapidly expanding, covering various forms of information for human, systems, and networks, such as network designs, channel coding, and optimization solutions. In this article, we present the concept of mobile-edge AI-Generated Everything (AIGX). Specifically, we first review the building blocks of AIGX, the evolution from AIGC to AIGX, as well as practical AIGX applications. Then, we present a unified mobile-edge AIGX framework, which employs edge devices to provide PFM-empowered AIGX services and optimizes such services via prompt engineering. More importantly, we demonstrate that suboptimal prompts lead to poor generation quality, which adversely affects user satisfaction, edge network performance, and resource utilization. Accordingly, we conduct a case study, showcasing how to train an effective prompt optimizer using ChatGPT and investigating how much improvement is possible with prompt engineering in terms of user experience, quality of generation, and network performance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figure |
| **[Read-only Prompt Optimization for Vision-Language Few-shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14960v2)** | 2023-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, prompt tuning has proven effective in adapting pre-trained vision-language models to downstream tasks. These methods aim to adapt the pre-trained models by introducing learnable prompts while keeping pre-trained weights frozen. However, learnable prompts can affect the internal representation within the self-attention module, which may negatively impact performance variance and generalization, especially in data-deficient settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Read-only Prompt Optimization (RPO). RPO leverages masked attention to prevent the internal representation shift in the pre-trained model. Further, to facilitate the optimization of RPO, the read-only prompts are initialized based on special tokens of the pre-trained model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RPO outperforms CLIP and CoCoOp in base-to-new generalization and domain generalization while displaying better robustness. Also, the proposed method achieves better generalization on extremely data-deficient settings, while improving parameter efficiency and computational overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/RPO.</p></details> | Accepted at ICCV2023 |
| **[Task-driven Prompt Evolution for Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17128v1)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Promptable foundation models, particularly Segment Anything Model (SAM), have emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional task-specific supervised learning for image segmentation. However, many evaluation studies have found that their performance on medical imaging modalities to be underwhelming compared to conventional deep learning methods. In the world of large pre-trained language and vision-language models, learning prompt from downstream tasks has achieved considerable success in improving performance. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Prompt Optimization Technique for foundation models like SAM (SAMPOT) that utilizes the downstream segmentation task to optimize the human-provided prompt to obtain improved performance. We demonstrate the utility of SAMPOT on lung segmentation in chest X-ray images and obtain an improvement on a significant number of cases ($\sim75\%$) over human-provided initial prompts. We hope this work will lead to further investigations in the nascent field of automatic visual prompt-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiPrompter: Cooperative Prompt Optimization with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16730v1)** | 2023-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been an increasing interest in automated prompt optimization based on reinforcement learning (RL). This approach offers important advantages, such as generating interpretable prompts and being compatible with black-box foundation models. However, the substantial prompt space size poses challenges for RL-based methods, often leading to suboptimal policy convergence. This paper introduces MultiPrompter, a new framework that views prompt optimization as a cooperative game between prompters which take turns composing a prompt together. Our cooperative prompt optimization effectively reduces the problem size and helps prompters learn optimal prompts. We test our method on the text-to-image task and show its ability to generate higher-quality images than baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unnatural language processing: How do language models handle machine-generated prompts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15829v1)** | 2023-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model prompt optimization research has shown that semantically and grammatically well-formed manually crafted prompts are routinely outperformed by automatically generated token sequences with no apparent meaning or syntactic structure, including sequences of vectors from a model's embedding space. We use machine-generated prompts to probe how models respond to input that is not composed of natural language expressions. We study the behavior of models of different sizes in multiple semantic tasks in response to both continuous and discrete machine-generated prompts, and compare it to the behavior in response to human-generated natural-language prompts. Even when producing a similar output, machine-generated and human prompts trigger different response patterns through the network processing pathways, including different perplexities, different attention and output entropy distributions, and different unit activation profiles. We provide preliminary insight into the nature of the units activated by different prompt types, suggesting that only natural language prompts recruit a genuinely linguistic circuit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2023 Camera-Ready</p></details> |
| **[Getting MoRE out of Mixture of Language Model Reasoning Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14628v2)** | 2023-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent large language models (LLMs) improve on various question answering (QA) datasets, it remains difficult for a single model to generalize across question types that require distinct reasoning abilities. We provide empirical evidence that state-of-the-art LLMs suffer from poor generalizability on reasoning types beyond those seen in the prompt. To remedy this, we propose a Mixture-of-Reasoning-Experts (MoRE) framework that ensembles diverse specialized language models. We specialize the backbone language model with prompts optimized for different reasoning categories, including factual, multihop, mathematical, and commonsense reasoning. Our key insight is to leverage agreement among the specialized experts to select the best answer for each question, or to abstain from answering. This gives MoRE higher accuracy than any single specialized model on a collection of 12 QA datasets from four reasoning types. Beyond generalizability, the interpretable design of MoRE improves selective question answering results compared to baselines without incorporating inter-expert agreement. This framework is also more interpretable and useful to human consumers of QA outputs. Our human study confirms that presenting expert predictions and the answer selection process helps annotators more accurately calibrate when to trust the system's output. We release all code and data to facilitate future work.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 Findings |
| **[Automatic Prompt Optimization with "Gradient Descent" and Beam Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03495v2)** | 2023-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance as general purpose agents, but their abilities remain highly dependent on prompts which are hand written with onerous trial-and-error effort. We propose a simple and nonparametric solution to this problem, Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which is inspired by numerical gradient descent to automatically improve prompts, assuming access to training data and an LLM API. The algorithm uses minibatches of data to form natural language "gradients" that criticize the current prompt. The gradients are then "propagated" into the prompt by editing the prompt in the opposite semantic direction of the gradient. These gradient descent steps are guided by a beam search and bandit selection procedure which significantly improves algorithmic efficiency. Preliminary results across three benchmark NLP tasks and the novel problem of LLM jailbreak detection suggest that Automatic Prompt Optimization can outperform prior prompt editing techniques and improve an initial prompt's performance by up to 31%, by using data to rewrite vague task descriptions into more precise annotation instructions.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 |
| **[DeltaSpace: A Semantic-aligned Feature Space for Flexible Text-guided Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08785v1)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image editing faces significant challenges to training and inference flexibility. Much literature collects large amounts of annotated image-text pairs to train text-conditioned generative models from scratch, which is expensive and not efficient. After that, some approaches that leverage pre-trained vision-language models are put forward to avoid data collection, but they are also limited by either per text-prompt optimization or inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. To address these issues, we investigate and identify a specific space, referred to as CLIP DeltaSpace, where the CLIP visual feature difference of two images is semantically aligned with the CLIP textual feature difference of their corresponding text descriptions. Based on DeltaSpace, we propose a novel framework called DeltaEdit, which maps the CLIP visual feature differences to the latent space directions of a generative model during the training phase, and predicts the latent space directions from the CLIP textual feature differences during the inference phase. And this design endows DeltaEdit with two advantages: (1) text-free training; (2) generalization to various text prompts for zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of DeltaEdit with different generative models, including both the GAN model and the diffusion model, in achieving flexible text-guided image editing. Code is available at https://github.com/Yueming6568/DeltaEdit.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.06285</p></details> |
| **[MLLM-DataEngine: An Iterative Refinement Approach for MLLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13566v2)** | 2023-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great advance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in both instruction dataset building and benchmarking, the independence of training and evaluation makes current MLLMs hard to further improve their capability under the guidance of evaluation results with a relatively low human cost. In this paper, we propose MLLM-DataEngine, a novel closed-loop system that bridges data generation, model training, and evaluation. Within each loop iteration, the MLLM-DataEngine first analyze the weakness of the model based on the evaluation results, then generate a proper incremental dataset for the next training iteration and enhance the model capability iteratively. Compared with previous data collection methods which are separate from the benchmarking, the data generated by MLLM-DataEngine shows better targeting, quality, and correctness. For targeting, we propose an Adaptive Bad-case Sampling module, which adjusts the ratio of different types of data within each incremental dataset based on the benchmarking results. For quality, we resort to GPT-4 to generate high-quality data with each given data type. For correctness, prompt design is critical for the data generation results. Rather than previous hand-crafted prompt, we propose an Interactive Prompt Optimization strategy, which optimizes the prompt with the multi-round interaction between human and GPT, and improve the correctness of generated data greatly. Through extensive experiments, we find our MLLM-DataEngine could boost the MLLM capability in a targeted and automatic manner, with only a few human participation. We hope it could be a general solution for the following MLLMs building. The MLLM-DataEngine has been open-sourced and is now available at https://github.com/opendatalab/MLLM-DataEngine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are available at https://github.com/opendatalab/MLLM-DataEngine</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Data Transformation Using Large Language Model: An Experimental Study on Building Energy Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01957v2)** | 2023-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches to automatic data transformation are insufficient to meet the requirements in many real-world scenarios, such as the building sector. First, there is no convenient interface for domain experts to provide domain knowledge easily. Second, they require significant training data collection overheads. Third, the accuracy suffers from complicated schema changes. To bridge this gap, we present a novel approach that leverages the unique capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in coding, complex reasoning, and zero-shot learning to generate SQL code that transforms the source datasets into the target datasets. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by designing an LLM-based framework, termed SQLMorpher, which comprises a prompt generator that integrates the initial prompt with optional domain knowledge and historical patterns in external databases. It also implements an iterative prompt optimization mechanism that automatically improves the prompt based on flaw detection. The key contributions of this work include (1) pioneering an end-to-end LLM-based solution for data transformation, (2) developing a benchmark dataset of 105 real-world building energy data transformation problems, and (3) conducting an extensive empirical evaluation where our approach achieved 96% accuracy in all 105 problems. SQLMorpher demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing LLMs in complex, domain-specific challenges, highlighting the potential of their potential to drive sustainable solutions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
