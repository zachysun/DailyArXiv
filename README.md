| **[DUET: Dual Clustering Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10859v3)** | 2025-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.10859v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as financial investment, energy management, weather forecasting, and traffic optimization. However, accurate forecasting is challenging due to two main factors. First, real-world time series often show heterogeneous temporal patterns caused by distribution shifts over time. Second, correlations among channels are complex and intertwined, making it hard to model the interactions among channels precisely and flexibly. In this study, we address these challenges by proposing a general framework called DUET, which introduces dual clustering on the temporal and channel dimensions to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. First, we design a Temporal Clustering Module (TCM) that clusters time series into fine-grained distributions to handle heterogeneous temporal patterns. For different distribution clusters, we design various pattern extractors to capture their intrinsic temporal patterns, thus modeling the heterogeneity. Second, we introduce a novel Channel-Soft-Clustering strategy and design a Channel Clustering Module (CCM), which captures the relationships among channels in the frequency domain through metric learning and applies sparsification to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy channels. Finally, DUET combines TCM and CCM to incorporate both the temporal and channel dimensions. Extensive experiments on 25 real-world datasets from 10 application domains, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DUET.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 research track</p></details> |

For example, the capacity to foresee stock market trends, natural disasters, business developments, or political events can facilitate early preventive measures and uncover new opportunities. Multiple diverse computational methods for attempting future predictions, including predictive analysis, time series forecasting, and simulations have been proposed. This study evaluates the performance of several large language models (LLMs) in supporting future prediction tasks, an under-explored domain. We assess the models across three scenarios: Affirmative vs. Likelihood questioning, Reasoning, and Counterfactual analysis. For this, we create a dataset1 by finding and categorizing news articles based on entity type and its popularity. We gather news articles before and after the LLMs training cutoff date in order to thoroughly test and compare model performance. Our research highlights LLMs potential and limitations in predictive modeling, providing a foundation for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaPRL: Adaptive Pairwise Regression Learning with Uncertainty Estimation for Universal Regression Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05809v1)** | 2025-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.05809v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current deep regression models usually learn in point-wise way that treat each sample as an independent input, neglecting the relative ordering among different data. Consequently, the regression model could neglect the data 's interrelationships, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance. Moreover, the existence of aleatoric uncertainty in the training data may drive the model to capture non-generalizable patterns, contributing to increased overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a novel adaptive pairwise learning framework (AdaPRL) for regression tasks which leverages the relative differences between data points and integrates with deep probabilistic models to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Additionally, we adapt AdaPRL for applications in multi-task learning and multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments with several real-world regression datasets including recommendation systems, age estimation, time series forecasting, natural language understanding, finance, and industry datasets show that AdaPRL is compatible with different backbone networks in various tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the vast majority of tasks, highlighting its notable potential including enhancing prediction accuracy and ranking ability, increasing generalization capability, improving robustness to noisy data, improving resilience to reduced data, and enhancing interpretability, etc.</p></details> | 22 pages, 11 figures |

While existing research primarily focuses on learning classification models, fewer studies have explored how end users can actively extract useful insights from sensor data, often hindered by the lack of a proper dataset. To address this gap, we introduce SensorQA, the first human-created question-answering (QA) dataset for long-term time-series sensor data for daily life monitoring. SensorQA is created by human workers and includes 5.6K diverse and practical queries that reflect genuine human interests, paired with accurate answers derived from sensor data. We further establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art AI models on this dataset and evaluate their performance on typical edge devices. Our results reveal a gap between current models and optimal QA performance and efficiency, highlighting the need for new contributions.

| **[LlamaV-o1: Rethinking Step-by-step Visual Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06186v1)** | 2025-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.06186v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is a fundamental capability for solving complex multi-step problems, particularly in visual contexts where sequential step-wise understanding is essential. Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating visual reasoning and do not emphasize step-wise problem-solving. To this end, we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step visual reasoning in large language models (LMMs) through three key contributions. First, we introduce a visual reasoning benchmark specifically designed to evaluate multi-step reasoning tasks. The benchmark presents a diverse set of challenges with eight different categories ranging from complex visual perception to scientific reasoning with over 4k reasoning steps in total, enabling robust evaluation of LLMs' abilities to perform accurate and interpretable visual reasoning across multiple steps. Second, we propose a novel metric that assesses visual reasoning quality at the granularity of individual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence. The proposed metric offers deeper insights into reasoning performance compared to traditional end-task accuracy metrics. Third, we present a new multimodal visual reasoning model, named LlamaV-o1, trained using a multi-step curriculum learning approach, where tasks are progressively organized to facilitate incremental skill acquisition and problem-solving. The proposed LlamaV-o1 is designed for multi-step reasoning and learns step-by-step through a structured training paradigm. Extensive experiments show that our LlamaV-o1 outperforms existing open-source models and performs favorably against close-source proprietary models. Compared to the recent Llava-CoT, our LlamaV-o1 achieves an average score of 67.3 with an absolute gain of 3.8\% across six benchmarks while being 5 times faster during inference scaling. Our benchmark, model, and code are publicly available.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 Figures |
| **[LUMIA: Linear probing for Unimodal and MultiModal Membership Inference Attacks leveraging internal LLM states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19876v3)** | 2025-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.19876v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in a variety of applications, but concerns around membership inference have grown in parallel. Previous efforts focus on black-to-grey-box models, thus neglecting the potential benefit from internal LLM information. To address this, we propose the use of Linear Probes (LPs) as a method to detect Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) by examining internal activations of LLMs. Our approach, dubbed LUMIA, applies LPs layer-by-layer to get fine-grained data on the model inner workings. We test this method across several model architectures, sizes and datasets, including unimodal and multimodal tasks. In unimodal MIA, LUMIA achieves an average gain of 15.71 % in Area Under the Curve (AUC) over previous techniques. Remarkably, LUMIA reaches AUC>60% in 65.33% of cases -- an increment of 46.80% against the state of the art. Furthermore, our approach reveals key insights, such as the model layers where MIAs are most detectable. In multimodal models, LPs indicate that visual inputs can significantly contribute to detect MIAs -- AUC>60% is reached in 85.90% of experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring LLMs for Automated Pre-Testing of Cross-Cultural Surveys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05985v1)** | 2025-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.05985v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing culturally relevant questionnaires for ICTD research is challenging, particularly when adapting surveys for populations to non-western contexts. Prior work adapted questionnaires through expert reviews and pilot studies, which are resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to automate the questionnaire pretesting process in cross-cultural settings. Our study used LLMs to adapt a U.S.-focused climate opinion survey for a South African audience. We then tested the adapted questionnaire with 116 South African participants via Prolific, asking them to provide feedback on both versions. Participants perceived the LLM-adapted questions as slightly more favorable than the traditional version. Our note opens discussions on the potential role of LLMs in adapting surveys and facilitating cross-cultural questionnaire design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICTD 2024 (Notes)</p></details> |
| **[Hermit Kingdom Through the Lens of Multiple Perspectives: A Case Study of LLM Hallucination on North Korea](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05981v1)** | 2025-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.05981v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge for their safe deployment, particularly due to its potential to spread misinformation. Most existing solutions address this challenge by focusing on aligning the models with credible sources or by improving how models communicate their confidence (or lack thereof) in their outputs. While these measures may be effective in most contexts, they may fall short in scenarios requiring more nuanced approaches, especially in situations where access to accurate data is limited or determining credible sources is challenging. In this study, we take North Korea - a country characterised by an extreme lack of reliable sources and the prevalence of sensationalist falsehoods - as a case study. We explore and evaluate how some of the best-performing multilingual LLMs and specific language-based models generate information about North Korea in three languages spoken in countries with significant geo-political interests: English (United States, United Kingdom), Korean (South Korea), and Mandarin Chinese (China). Our findings reveal significant differences, suggesting that the choice of model and language can lead to vastly different understandings of North Korea, which has important implications given the global security challenges the country poses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[Model Inversion in Split Learning for Personalized LLMs: New Insights from Information Bottleneck Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05965v1)** | 2025-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.05965v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent, showcasing the impressive capabilities of models like GPT-4. This trend has also catalyzed extensive research on deploying LLMs on mobile devices. Feasible approaches for such edge-cloud deployment include using split learning. However, previous research has largely overlooked the privacy leakage associated with intermediate representations transmitted from devices to servers. This work is the first to identify model inversion attacks in the split learning framework for LLMs, emphasizing the necessity of secure defense. For the first time, we introduce mutual information entropy to understand the information propagation of Transformer-based LLMs and assess privacy attack performance for LLM blocks. To address the issue of representations being sparser and containing less information than embeddings, we propose a two-stage attack system in which the first part projects representations into the embedding space, and the second part uses a generative model to recover text from these embeddings. This design breaks down the complexity and achieves attack scores of 38%-75% in various scenarios, with an over 60% improvement over the SOTA. This work comprehensively highlights the potential privacy risks during the deployment of personalized LLMs on the edge side.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Can Many-Shot In-Context Learning Help LLMs as Evaluators? A Preliminary Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11629v5)** | 2025-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.11629v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators to assess the performance of LLMs has garnered attention. However, this kind of evaluation approach is affected by potential biases within LLMs, raising concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and study two many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) prompt templates to help LLM evaluators mitigate potential biases: Many-Shot with Reference (MSwR) and Many-Shot without Reference (MSoR). Specifically, the former utilizes in-context examples with model-generated evaluation rationales as references, while the latter does not include these references. Using these prompt designs, we investigate the impact of increasing the number of in-context examples on the consistency and quality of the evaluation results. Experimental results show that advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4o, perform better in the many-shot regime than in the zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Furthermore, when using GPT-4o as an evaluator in the many-shot regime, adopting MSwR as the prompt template performs better than MSoR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLMs Reproduce Stereotypes of Sexual and Gender Minorities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05926v1)** | 2025-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.05926v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large body of research has found substantial gender bias in NLP systems. Most of this research takes a binary, essentialist view of gender: limiting its variation to the categories _men_ and _women_, conflating gender with sex, and ignoring different sexual identities. But gender and sexuality exist on a spectrum, so in this paper we study the biases of large language models (LLMs) towards sexual and gender minorities beyond binary categories. Grounding our study in a widely used psychological framework -- the Stereotype Content Model -- we demonstrate that English-language survey questions about social perceptions elicit more negative stereotypes of sexual and gender minorities from LLMs, just as they do from humans. We then extend this framework to a more realistic use case: text generation. Our analysis shows that LLMs generate stereotyped representations of sexual and gender minorities in this setting, raising concerns about their capacity to amplify representational harms in creative writing, a widely promoted use case.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

| **[Enhancing Sample Generation of Diffusion Models using Noise Level Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05488v2)** | 2025-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.05488v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The denoising process of diffusion models can be interpreted as an approximate projection of noisy samples onto the data manifold. Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[MB-TaylorFormer V2: Improved Multi-branch Linear Transformer Expanded by Taylor Formula for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04486v1)** | 2025-01-08 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.04486v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Transformer networks have demonstrated outstanding performance in the field of image restoration due to the global receptive field and adaptability to input. However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead. The source code is available at https://github.com/FVL2020/MB-TaylorFormerV2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixed Points of Deep Neural Networks: Emergence, Stability, and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04182v1)** | 2025-01-07 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.04182v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present numerical and analytical results on the formation and stability of a family of fixed points of deep neural networks (DNNs). Such fixed points appear in a class of DNNs when dimensions of input and output vectors are the same. We demonstrate examples of applications of such networks in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning such as encoding/decoding of images, restoration of damaged images among others. We present several numerical and analytical results. First, we show that for untrained DNN's with weights and biases initialized by normally distributed random variables the only one fixed point exists. This result holds for DNN with any depth (number of layers) $L$, any layer width $N$, and sigmoid-type activation functions. Second, it has been shown that for a DNN whose parameters (weights and biases) are initialized by ``light-tailed'' distribution of weights (e.g. normal distribution), after training the distribution of these parameters become ``heavy-tailed''. This motivates our study of DNNs with ``heavy-tailed'' initialization. For such DNNs we show numerically %existence and stability that training leads to emergence of $Q(N,L)$ fixed points, where $Q(N,L)$ is a positive integer which depends on the number of layers $L$ and layer width $N$. We further observe numerically that for fixed $N = N_0$ the function $Q(N_0, L)$ is non-monotone, that is it initially grows as $L$ increases and then decreases to 1. This non-monotone behavior of $Q(N_0, L)$ is also obtained by analytical derivation of equation for Empirical Spectral Distribution (ESD) of input-output Jacobian followed by numerical solution of this equation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

The recent advent of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model in the natural language processing field has attracted much attention due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D medical images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Even a lightweight variant of Restore-RWKV, with only 1.16 million parameters, achieves comparable or even superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting Restore-RWKV achieves SOTA performance across a range of medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, MRI image super-resolution, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Color Balance Prior \textbf{Guided} \textbf{Hyb}rid \textbf{Sens}e \textbf{U}nderwater \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration framework (\textbf{GuidedHybSensUIR}). This framework operates on multiple scales, employing the proposed \textbf{Detail Restorer} module to restore low-level detailed features at finer scales and utilizing the proposed \textbf{Feature Contextualizer} module to capture long-range contextual relations of high-level general features at a broader scale. The hybridization of these different scales of sensing results effectively addresses color casts and restores blurry details. In order to effectively point out the evolutionary direction for the model, we propose a novel \textbf{Color Balance Prior} as a strong guide in the feature contextualization step and as a weak guide in the final decoding phase. We construct a comprehensive benchmark using paired training data from three real-world underwater datasets and evaluate on six test sets, including three paired and three unpaired, sourced from four real-world underwater datasets. Subsequently, we tested 14 traditional and retrained 23 deep learning existing underwater image restoration methods on this benchmark, obtaining metric results for each approach. This effort aims to furnish a valuable benchmarking dataset for standard basis for comparison. The extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms 37 other state-of-the-art methods overall on various benchmark datasets and metrics, despite not achieving the best results in certain individual cases.

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Image Restoration Using Few-Step Guidance of Consistency Models (and Beyond)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20596v1)** | 2024-12-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.20596v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, it has become popular to tackle image restoration tasks with a single pretrained diffusion model (DM) and data-fidelity guidance, instead of training a dedicated deep neural network per task. However, such "zero-shot" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at: https://github.com/tirer-lab/CM4IR</p></details> |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradationspecific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms stateof-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/mrluin/UniRestorer.</p></details> | 28 pages, 20 figures |

These methods typically flatten 2D images into multiple distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, process each sequence independently using selective scan operation, and recombine them to form the outputs. However, such a paradigm overlooks two vital aspects: i) the local relationships and spatial continuity inherent in natural images, and ii) the discrepancies among sequences unfolded through totally different ways. To overcome the drawbacks, we explore two problems in Mamba-based restoration methods: i) how to design a scanning strategy preserving both locality and continuity while facilitating restoration, and ii) how to aggregate the distinct sequences unfolded in totally different ways. To address these problems, we propose a novel Mamba-based Image Restoration model (MaIR), which consists of Nested S-shaped Scanning strategy (NSS) and Sequence Shuffle Attention block (SSA). Specifically, NSS preserves locality and continuity of the input images through the stripe-based scanning region and the S-shaped scanning path, respectively. SSA aggregates sequences through calculating attention weights within the corresponding channels of different sequences. Thanks to NSS and SSA, MaIR surpasses 40 baselines across 14 challenging datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of image super-resolution, denoising, deblurring and dehazing. Our codes will be available after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing diffusion bridge models often rely on Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) samplers, which result in slower inference speed compared to diffusion models that employ high-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers for acceleration. To mitigate this gap, we propose a high-order ODE sampler with a stochastic start for diffusion bridge models. To overcome the singular behavior of the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) at the beginning of the reverse process, a posterior sampling approach was introduced at the first reverse step. The sampling was designed to ensure a smooth transition from corrupted images to the generative trajectory while reducing discretization errors. Following this stochastic start, Heun's second-order solver is applied to solve the PF-ODE, achieving high perceptual quality with significantly reduced neural function evaluations (NFEs). Our method is fully compatible with pretrained diffusion bridge models and requires no additional training. Extensive experiments on image restoration and translation tasks, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, Edges-to-Handbags, and DIODE-Outdoor, demonstrated that our sampler outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and Frechet Inception Distance (FID).</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This phenomenon can significantly detract from the quality of the images captured, making it an interesting challenge to develop a deep learning model that utilizes the principles of adversarial networks to restore clarity to these blurred pixels. In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively deblur images affected by motion blur. A GAN-based Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions. This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in this project. The blurry pixels are sharper in the output of GAN model shows a good image restoration effect in real world applications.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches have leveraged various deep learning techniques, including Transformers and complex, parameter-heavy models to achieve significant improvements in restoration effects, we demonstrate that pure CNN architectures with lightweight parameters can achieve comparable results. In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we introduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that well-designed pure CNN architectures can effectively compete with more complex models, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency.

The skip-connections transmit fine-grained information from the encoder to the decoder. It is necessary to maintain the feature maps used by the skip-connections in memory before the decoding stage. Therefore, they are not friendly to devices with limited resource. In this paper, we propose a universal method and architecture to reduce the memory consumption and meanwhile generate enhanced feature maps to improve network performance. To this end, we design a simple but effective Multi-Scale Information Aggregation Module (MSIAM) in the encoder and an Information Enhancement Module (IEM) in the decoder. The MSIAM aggregates multi-scale feature maps into single-scale with less memory. After that, the aggregated feature maps can be expanded and enhanced to multi-scale feature maps by the IEM. By applying the proposed method on NAFNet, a SOTA model in the field of image restoration, we design a memory-efficient and feature-enhanced network architecture, UNet--. The memory demand by the skip-connections in the UNet-- is reduced by 93.3%, while the performance is improved compared to NAFNet. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method can be generalized to multiple visual tasks, with consistent improvements in both memory consumption and network accuracy compared to the existing efficient architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ACCV2024</p></details> |

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies focus on restoring either color or the geometry, but to our best knowledge, not both. However, in practice it may be cumbersome to address the two rectifications one-by-one. In this paper, we propose NeuroPump, a self-supervised method to simultaneously optimize and rectify underwater geometry and color as if water were pumped out. The key idea is to explicitly model refraction, absorption and scattering in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipeline, such that it not only performs simultaneous geometric and color rectification, but also enables to synthesize novel views and optical effects by controlling the decoupled parameters. In addition, to address issue of lack of real paired ground truth images, we propose an underwater 360 benchmark dataset that has real paired (i.e., with and without water) images. Our method clearly outperforms other baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

However, most of mainstream Transformer-based ones confronted with dilemma between model capabilities and computation burdens, since self-attention mechanism quadratically increase in computational complexity with respect to image size, and has inadequacies in capturing long-range dependencies. Most of Mamba-related ones solely scanned feature map in spatial dimension for global modeling, failing to fully utilize information in channel dimension. To address aforementioned problems, this paper has proposed to fully utilize complementary advantages from Mamba and Transformer without sacrificing computation efficiency. Specifically, the selective scanning mechanism of Mamba is employed to focus on spatial modeling, enabling capture long-range spatial dependencies under linear complexity. The self-attention mechanism of Transformer is applied to focus on channel modeling, avoiding high computation burdens that are in quadratic growth with image's spatial dimensions. Moreover, to enrich informative prompts for effective image restoration, multi-dimensional prompt learning modules are proposed to learn prompt-flows from multi-scale encoder/decoder layers, benefiting for revealing underlying characteristic of various degradations from both spatial and channel perspectives, therefore, enhancing the capabilities of "all-in-one" model to solve various restoration tasks. Extensive experiment results on several image restoration benchmark tasks such as image denoising, dehazing, and deraining, have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve new state-of-the-art performance, compared with many popular mainstream methods.

Inspired by the iterative refinement capabilities of diffusion models, we propose CycleRDM, a novel framework designed to unify restoration and enhancement tasks while achieving high-quality mapping. Specifically, CycleRDM first learns the mapping relationships among the degraded domain, the rough normal domain, and the normal domain through a two-stage diffusion inference process. Subsequently, we transfer the final calibration process to the wavelet low-frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform, performing fine-grained calibration from a frequency domain perspective by leveraging task-specific frequency spaces. To improve restoration quality, we design a feature gain module for the decomposed wavelet high-frequency domain to eliminate redundant features. Additionally, we employ multimodal textual prompts and Fourier transform to drive stable denoising and reduce randomness during the inference process. After extensive validation, CycleRDM can be effectively generalized to a wide range of image restoration and enhancement tasks while requiring only a small number of training samples to be significantly superior on various benchmarks of reconstruction quality and perceptual quality.

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Recently, while vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success in various vision tasks, their self-attention (SA) module's complexity scales quadratically with image resolution, hindering their applicability on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, the proposed DPTE-Net substitutes traditional SA modules with efficient pooling mechanisms, significantly reducing computational demands while preserving ViTs' learning capabilities. To further enhance semantic feature learning, a distillation-based training process is implemented which transfers rich knowledge from a larger teacher network to DPTE-Net. Additionally, DPTE-Net is trained within a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, leveraging the strong generalization of GAN in image restoration, and employs a transmission-aware loss function to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed DPTE-Net can achieve competitive dehazing performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a promising solution for resource-limited applications.

| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v2)** | 2024-12-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.20008v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (\ie, SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements. The visual results, code, and trained models are available at https://github.com/Amazingren/SemanIR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods. Our model, DarkIR, achieves new state-of-the-art results on the popular LOLBlur, LOLv2 and Real-LOLBlur datasets, being able to generalize on real-world night and dark images.

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired diffusion-based image restoration method that uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

In practical applications, however, the degradation is often unknown, and the mismatch between the model and the degradation will result in a severe performance drop. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one image restoration network that tackles multiple degradations. Due to the heterogeneous nature of different types of degradations, it is difficult to process multiple degradations in a single network. To this end, we propose to learn a neural degradation representation (NDR) that captures the underlying characteristics of various degradations. The learned NDR decomposes different types of degradations adaptively, similar to a neural dictionary that represents basic degradation components. Subsequently, we develop a degradation query module and a degradation injection module to effectively recognize and utilize the specific degradation based on NDR, enabling the all-in-one restoration ability for multiple degradations. Moreover, we propose a bidirectional optimization strategy to effectively drive NDR to learn the degradation representation by optimizing the degradation and restoration processes alternately. Comprehensive experiments on representative types of degradations (including noise, haze, rain, and downsampling) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mdyao/NDR-Restore</p></details> |

Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |

However, previous KD methods for image restoration overlook the state of the student during the distillation, adopting a fixed solution space that limits the capability of KD. Additionally, relying solely on L1-type loss struggles to leverage the distribution information of images. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic contrastive knowledge distillation (DCKD) framework for image restoration. Specifically, we introduce dynamic contrastive regularization to perceive the student's learning state and dynamically adjust the distilled solution space using contrastive learning. Additionally, we also propose a distribution mapping module to extract and align the pixel-level category distribution of the teacher and student models. Note that the proposed DCKD is a structure-agnostic distillation framework, which can adapt to different backbones and can be combined with methods that optimize upper-bound constraints to further enhance model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCKD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods across various image restoration tasks and backbones.</p></details> |  |

While DDMs have demonstrated a promising performance in many applications such as text-to-image synthesis, their effectiveness in image restoration is often hindered by shape and color distortions. We observe that these issues arise from inconsistencies between the training and testing data used by DDMs. Based on our observation, we propose a novel training method, named data-consistent training, which allows the DDMs to access images with accumulated errors during training, thereby ensuring the model to learn to correct these errors. Experimental results show that, across five image restoration tasks, our method has significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while effectively minimizing distortions and preserving image fidelity.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential.

However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer (IPT) that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. While most research propose feature adaptation methods, we reveal their failure in addressing highly distinct tasks, and suggest weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we search for task-sensitive weights and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn both general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. As an additional feature, we enable Instruct-IPT to receive human prompts. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well.

Most existing works rely on (weighted) least squares methods under various low-rank constraints. However, minimizing the sum of squared residuals is not always efficient, as it may ignore the potential structural information in the residuals. In this study, we propose a novel residual spectral matching criterion that incorporates not only the numerical but also locational information of residuals. This criterion is the first in noisy matrix completion to adopt the perspective of low-rank perturbation of random matrices and exploit the spectral properties of sparse random matrices. We derive optimal statistical properties by analyzing the spectral properties of sparse random matrices and bounding the effects of low-rank perturbations and partial observations. Additionally, we propose algorithms that efficiently approximate solutions by constructing easily computable pseudo-gradients. The iterative process of the proposed algorithms ensures convergence at a rate consistent with the optimal statistical error bound.

However, existing convolutional residual building modules for IR encounter limited ability to map inputs into high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, and their local receptive fields have difficulty in capturing long-range context information like Transformer. Besides, CNN-based attention modules for IR either face static abundant parameters or have limited receptive fields. To address the first issue, we propose an efficient residual star module (ERSM) that includes context-aware "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to contextually map features into exceedingly high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, which greatly enhances representation learning. To further boost the extraction of contextual information, as for the second issue, we propose a large dynamic integration module (LDIM) which possesses an extremely large receptive field. Thus, LDIM can dynamically and efficiently integrate more contextual information that helps to further significantly improve the reconstruction performance. Integrating ERSM and LDIM into an U-shaped backbone, we propose a context-aware convolutional network (CCNet) with powerful learning ability for contextual high-dimensional mapping and abundant contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our CCNet with low model complexity achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods on several IR tasks, including image dehazing, image motion deblurring, and image desnowing.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the mainstream for this task, demonstrating substantial performance improvements. However, there are still three significant issues remain unaddressed: (1) ViTs struggle to capture high-frequency components of images, limiting their ability to detect local textures and edge information, thereby impeding MRI restoration; (2) Previous methods calculate multi-head self-attention (MSA) among both related and unrelated tokens in content, introducing noise and significantly increasing computational burden; (3) The naive feed-forward network in ViTs cannot model the multi-scale information that is important for image restoration. In this paper, we propose FPS-Former, a powerful ViT-based framework, to address these issues from the perspectives of frequency modulation, spatial purification, and scale diversification. Specifically, for issue (1), we introduce a frequency modulation attention module to enhance the self-attention map by adaptively re-calibrating the frequency information in a Laplacian pyramid. For issue (2), we customize a spatial purification attention module to capture interactions among closely related tokens, thereby reducing redundant or irrelevant feature representations. For issue (3), we propose an efficient feed-forward network based on a hybrid-scale fusion strategy. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our FPS-Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring lower computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Conditional Latent Diffusion Models Effective for Image Restoration?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09324v2)** | 2024-12-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.09324v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image restoration increasingly employ conditional latent diffusion models (CLDMs). While these models have demonstrated notable performance improvements in recent years, this work questions their suitability for IR tasks. CLDMs excel in capturing high-level semantic correlations, making them effective for tasks like text-to-image generation with spatial conditioning. However, in IR, where the goal is to enhance image perceptual quality, these models face difficulty of modeling the relationship between degraded images and ground truth images using a low-level representation. To support our claims, we compare state-of-the-art CLDMs with traditional image restoration models through extensive experiments. Results reveal that despite the scaling advantages of CLDMs, they suffer from high distortion and semantic deviation, especially in cases with minimal degradation, where traditional methods outperform them. Additionally, we perform empirical studies to examine the impact of various CLDM design elements on their restoration performance. We hope this finding inspires a reexamination of current CLDM-based IR solutions, opening up more opportunities in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on challenging datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

Existing methods that rely on local blur detection often suffer from inaccuracies and cannot generate satisfactory results when focusing solely on blurred regions. To overcome these problems, we first design a context-based local blur detection module that incorporates additional contextual information to improve the identification of blurry regions. Considering that modern smartphones are equipped with cameras capable of providing short-exposure images, we develop a blur-aware guided image restoration method that utilizes sharp structural details from short-exposure images, facilitating accurate reconstruction of heavily blurred regions. Furthermore, to restore images realistically and visually-pleasant, we develop a short-exposure guided diffusion model that explores useful features from short-exposure images and blurred regions to better constrain the diffusion process. Finally, we formulate the above components into a simple yet effective network, named ExpRDiff. Experimental results show that ExpRDiff performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://github.com/yzb1997/ExpRDiff</p></details> |

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack a unified training benchmark for iterations and configurations. We also identify a bias in image complexity distributions between commonly used IR training and testing datasets, resulting in suboptimal restoration outcomes. To address this, we introduce a large-scale IR dataset called ReSyn, which employs a novel image filtering method based on image complexity to ensure a balanced distribution and includes both real and AIGC synthetic images. We establish a unified training standard that specifies iterations and configurations for image restoration models, focusing on measuring model convergence and restoration capability. Additionally, we enhance transformer-based image restoration models using linear attention mechanisms by proposing RWKV-IR, which integrates linear complexity RWKV into the transformer structure, allowing for both global and local receptive fields. Instead of directly using Vision-RWKV, we replace the original Q-Shift in RWKV with a Depth-wise Convolution shift to better model local dependencies, combined with Bi-directional attention for comprehensive linear attention. We also introduce a Cross-Bi-WKV module that merges two Bi-WKV modules with different scanning orders for balanced horizontal and vertical attention. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our RWKV-IR model.</p></details> |  |

These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/VaT.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

Single-image solutions face an inherent tradeoff between noise reduction and motion blur. While short exposures can capture clear motion, they suffer from noise amplification. Long exposures reduce noise but introduce blur. Learning-based single-image enhancers tend to be over-smooth due to the limited information. Multi-image solutions using burst mode avoid this tradeoff by capturing more spatial-temporal information but often struggle with misalignment from camera/scene motion. To address these limitations, we propose a physical-model-based image restoration approach leveraging a novel dual-exposure Quad-Bayer pattern sensor. By capturing pairs of short and long exposures at the same starting point but with varying durations, this method integrates complementary noise-blur information within a single image. We further introduce a Quad-Bayer synthesis method (B2QB) to simulate sensor data from Bayer patterns to facilitate training. Based on this dual-exposure sensor model, we design a hierarchical convolutional neural network called QRNet to recover high-quality RGB images. The network incorporates input enhancement blocks and multi-level feature extraction to improve restoration quality. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art deblurring and denoising methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, transformer-based methods with pyramid structures have advanced the field by capturing long-range cross-scale spatial interaction. Despite its popularity, the degradation of essential features during the upsampling process notably compromised the restoration performance, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction outcomes. We introduce the EchoIR, an UNet-like image restoration network with a bilateral learnable upsampling mechanism to bridge this gap. Specifically, we proposed the Echo-Upsampler that optimizes the upsampling process by learning from the bilateral intermediate features of U-Net, the "Echo", aiming for a more refined restoration by minimizing the degradation during upsampling. In pursuit of modeling a hierarchical model of image restoration and upsampling tasks, we propose the Approximated Sequential Bi-level Optimization (AS-BLO), an advanced bi-level optimization model establishing a relationship between upsampling learning and image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods demonstrate the proposed EchoIR surpasses the existing methods, achieving SOTA performance in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RS image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real remote sensing images.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Existing methods often struggle with slow processing times and suboptimal restoration, especially under severe degradation, failing to accurately reconstruct finer-level identity details. To address these issues, we introduce InstantRestore, a novel framework that leverages a single-step image diffusion model and an attention-sharing mechanism for fast and personalized face restoration. Additionally, InstantRestore incorporates a novel landmark attention loss, aligning key facial landmarks to refine the attention maps, enhancing identity preservation. At inference time, given a degraded input and a small (~4) set of reference images, InstantRestore performs a single forward pass through the network to achieve near real-time performance. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full diffusion processes or per-identity model tuning, InstantRestore offers a scalable solution suitable for large-scale applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstantRestore outperforms existing methods in quality and speed, making it an appealing choice for identity-preserving face restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/InstantRestore/</p></details> |

To address this, we propose using text as an auxiliary invariant representation to reactivate the generative capabilities of these models. We begin by identifying two key properties of text input: richness and relevance, and examine their respective influence on model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce Res-Captioner, a module that generates enhanced textual descriptions tailored to image content and degradation levels, effectively mitigating response failures. Additionally, we present RealIR, a new benchmark designed to capture diverse real-world scenarios.

However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization.

Despite its advantage in miniaturization, its practicality is constrained by severe aberrations and distortions, which significantly degrade the image quality. Several previous arts have attempted to address different types of aberrations, yet most of them are mainly designed for the traditional bulky lens and not convincing enough to remedy harsh aberrations of the metalens. While there have existed aberration correction methods specifically for metalens, they still fall short of restoration quality. In this work, we propose MetaFormer, an aberration correction framework for metalens-captured images, harnessing Vision Transformers (ViT) that has shown remarkable restoration performance in diverse image restoration tasks. Specifically, we devise a Multiple Adaptive Filters Guidance (MAFG), where multiple Wiener filters enrich the degraded input images with various noise-detail balances, enhancing output restoration quality. In addition, we introduce a Spatial and Transposed self-Attention Fusion (STAF) module, which aggregates features from spatial self-attention and transposed self-attention modules to further ameliorate aberration correction. We conduct extensive experiments, including correcting aberrated images and videos, and clean 3D reconstruction from the degraded images. The proposed method outperforms the previous arts by a significant margin.

Their restoration, classically including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restoration could be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoiding propagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require to train a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single network to restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive the uncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimization scheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating the uncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalable posterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, we propose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficiently computes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images, asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xz and SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversion methods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posterior samples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is not required.</p></details> |  |

To address such visual degradations, a variety of approaches have been proposed covering from basic signal processing methods to deep learning models; however, none of them has proven to be consistently successful. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model, Co-Operational Regressor Networks (CoRe-Nets), designed to achieve the best possible underwater image restoration. A CoRe-Net consists of two co-operating networks: the Apprentice Regressor (AR), responsible for image transformation, and the Master Regressor (MR), which evaluates the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the images generated by the AR and feeds it back to AR. CoRe-Nets are built on Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs), which offer a superior learning capability by modulating nonlinearity in kernel transformations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on the benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset. Leveraging the joint learning capabilities of the two cooperating networks, the proposed model achieves the state-of-art restoration performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and often presents such results that can even surpass the visual quality of the ground truth with a 2-pass application. Our results and the optimized PyTorch implementation of the proposed approach are now publicly shared on GitHub.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Current works predominantly concentrate on high-level tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the quality of original images is usually not guaranteed in the real world, leading to even worse perceptual quality or downstream task performance after compression. Low-level (LL) machine vision models, like image restoration models, can help improve such quality, and thereby their compression requirements should also be considered. In this paper, we propose a pioneered ICM framework for LL machine vision tasks, namely LL-ICM. By jointly optimizing compression and LL tasks, the proposed LL-ICM not only enriches its encoding ability in generalizing to versatile LL tasks but also optimizes the processing ability of down-stream LL task models, achieving mutual adaptation for image codecs and LL task models. Furthermore, we integrate large-scale vision-language models into the LL-ICM framework to generate more universal and distortion-robust feature embeddings for LL vision tasks. Therefore, one LL-ICM codec can generalize to multiple tasks. We establish a solid benchmark to evaluate LL-ICM, which includes extensive objective experiments by using both full and no-reference image quality assessments. Experimental results show that LL-ICM can achieve 22.65% BD-rate reductions over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current IR methods for composite degradations require building training data that contain an exponential number of possible degradation combinations, which brings in a significant burden. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new task setting, i.e. Universal Image Restoration (UIR). Specifically, UIR doesn't require training on all the degradation combinations but only on a set of degradation bases and then removing any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought that prompts large language models (LLMs) to address problems step-by-step, we propose Chain-of-Restoration (CoR) mechanism, which instructs models to remove unknown composite degradations step-by-step. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation.

However, these methods sometimes fail to recognize some salient objects, resulting in inaccurate semantic restoration in these regions. Additionally, the same region may have a strong response to more than one prompt and it will lead to semantic ambiguity for image super-resolution. To alleviate the above two issues, in this paper, we propose to consider semantic segmentation as an additional control condition into diffusion-based image super-resolution. Compared to textual prompt conditions, semantic segmentation enables a more comprehensive perception of salient objects within an image by assigning class labels to each pixel. It also mitigates the risks of semantic ambiguities by explicitly allocating objects to their respective spatial regions. In practice, inspired by the fact that image super-resolution and segmentation can benefit each other, we propose SegSR which introduces a dual-diffusion framework to facilitate interaction between the image super-resolution and segmentation diffusion models. Specifically, we develop a Dual-Modality Bridge module to enable updated information flow between these two diffusion models, achieving mutual benefit during the reverse diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that SegSR can generate realistic images while preserving semantic structures more effectively.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, large-scale high-quality real-world training data is urgently needed to facilitate the emergence of foundational models for image restoration. To advance this field, we spare no effort in contributing a million-scale dataset with two notable advantages over existing training data: real-world samples with larger-scale, and degradation types with higher diversity. By adjusting internal camera settings and external imaging conditions, we can capture aligned image pairs using our well-designed data acquisition system over multiple rounds and our data alignment criterion. Moreover, we propose a robust model, FoundIR, to better address a broader range of restoration tasks in real-world scenarios, taking a further step toward foundation models. Specifically, we first utilize a diffusion-based generalist model to remove degradations by learning the degradation-agnostic common representations from diverse inputs, where incremental learning strategy is adopted to better guide model training. To refine the model's restoration capability in complex scenarios, we introduce degradation-aware specialist models for achieving final high-quality results.

In this work, we present LADiBI, a training-free framework that uses large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to solve blind inverse problems with minimal assumptions. By leveraging natural language prompts, LADiBI jointly models priors for both the target image and operator, allowing for flexible adaptation across a variety of tasks. Additionally, we propose a novel posterior sampling approach that combines effective operator initialization with iterative refinement, enabling LADiBI to operate without predefined operator forms.

However, this paradigm faces significant challenges when transferring to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks due to: 1) the domain gap between RGB and HSI features and difference on their structures, 2) information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and 3) difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation representations through text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework. By leveraging the frequency-aware feature modulation based on characteristics of HSI degradations, we decompose text prompts into intensity and bias controllers to effectively guide the restoration process while avoiding domain gaps. Our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance under various degradation combinations, indicating great potential for practical remote sensing applications.

To strike a balance between efficiency and model capacity for a generalized transformer-based IR method, we propose a hierarchical information flow mechanism for image restoration, dubbed Hi-IR, which progressively propagates information among pixels in a bottom-up manner. Hi-IR constructs a hierarchical information tree representing the degraded image across three levels. Each level encapsulates different types of information, with higher levels encompassing broader objects and concepts and lower levels focusing on local details. Moreover, the hierarchical tree architecture removes long-range self-attention, improves the computational efficiency and memory utilization, thus preparing it for effective model scaling. Based on that, we explore model scaling to improve our method's capabilities, which is expected to positively impact IR in large-scale training settings. Extensive experimental results show that Hi-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, affirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance. The proposed MoCE-IR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, affirming its efficiency and practical applicability.

However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration (ABAIR) model, which can address multiple degradations, generalizes well to unseen degradations, and efficiently incorporate new degradations by training a small fraction of parameters. First, we train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations, augmented with a segmentation head to estimate per-pixel degradation types, resulting in a powerful backbone able to generalize to a wide range of degradations. Second, we adapt our baseline model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. Our model is both powerful in handling specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks, it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on five- and three-task IR setups, but also shows improved generalization to unseen degradations and also composite distortions.</p></details> | 17 pages |

They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint. under review.

AWIR models are trained to address a specific set of weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow. But this causes them to often struggle with out-of-distribution (OoD) samples or unseen degradations which limits their effectiveness for real-world autonomous navigation. To overcome this issue, existing models must either be retrained or fine-tuned, both of which are inefficient and impractical, with retraining needing access to large datasets, and fine-tuning involving many parameters. In this paper, we propose using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt a pre-trained all-weather model to novel weather restoration tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LoRA lowers the performance of the adapted model on the pre-trained restoration tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a LoRA-based fine-tuning method called LoRA-Align (LoRA-A) which seeks to align the singular vectors of the fine-tuned and pre-trained weight matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This alignment helps preserve the model's knowledge of its original tasks while adapting it to unseen tasks. We show that images restored with LoRA and LoRA-A can be effectively used for computer vision tasks in autonomous navigation, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/loraapage/</p></details> |

However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on the implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR.

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting detailed artifact maps. The absence of such quality metrics hinders accurate predictions of the quality of generated views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a new no-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution that is later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. We test and evaluate our method in the context of 3D reconstruction; to this end, we collected a novel dataset of human quality assessment in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method can not only successfully localize artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, but do so without direct references. Surprisingly, our metric outperforms both no-reference metrics and popular full-reference image metrics. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing weather restoration approaches are only capable of handling a specific type of degradation, which is often insufficient in real-world scenarios, such as rainy-snowy or rainy-hazy weather. Towards being able to address these situations, we propose a multi-weather Transformer, or MWFormer for short, which is a holistic vision Transformer that aims to solve multiple weather-induced degradations using a single, unified architecture. MWFormer uses hyper-networks and feature-wise linear modulation blocks to restore images degraded by various weather types using the same set of learned parameters. We first employ contrastive learning to train an auxiliary network that extracts content-independent, distortion-aware feature embeddings that efficiently represent predicted weather types, of which more than one may occur. Guided by these weather-informed predictions, the image restoration Transformer adaptively modulates its parameters to conduct both local and global feature processing, in response to multiple possible weather. Moreover, MWFormer allows for a novel way of tuning, during application, to either a single type of weather restoration or to hybrid weather restoration without any retraining, offering greater controllability than existing methods. Our experimental results on multi-weather restoration benchmarks show that MWFormer achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring much computational cost. Moreover, we demonstrate that our methodology of using hyper-networks can be integrated into various network architectures to further boost their performance.

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel multiple-in-one IR model that can effectively restore images with both single and mixed degradations. To address degradation diversity, we design a Local Dynamic Optimization (LDO) module which dynamically processes degraded areas of varying types and granularities. To tackle the prompt singularity issue, we develop an efficient Conditional Feature Embedding (CFE) module that guides the decoder in leveraging degradation-type-related features, significantly improving the model's performance in mixed degradation restoration scenarios.

The video data obtained from these telescopes differ significantly from data for standard 3D reconstruction tasks, characterized by intense motion blur, atmospheric turbulence, pervasive background light pollution, extended focal length and constrained observational perspectives. To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We apply a customized Structure from Motion (SfM) approach, followed by an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, to achieve high-fidelity 3D model reconstruction. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station and International Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.</p></details> |  |

To dynamically balance the brightness in output images, we also introduce a Fourier transform module that adjusts the luminance channel in the frequency domain. This mechanism could uniformly balance brightness across different regions while eliminating background noises, and thereby enhancing visual quality. By combining these innovative components, LTCF-Net effectively improves low-light image quality while keeping the model lightweight.

However, existing multi-task approaches typically rely on augmenting the model with additional parameters to handle multiple scenarios. While this enables the model to address diverse tasks, the introduction of extra parameters significantly complicates its practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-Guided Parameter Mask for Multi-Scenario Image Restoration under adverse weather, designed to effectively handle image degradation under diverse weather conditions without additional parameters. Our method segments model parameters into common and specific components by evaluating the gradient variation intensity during training for each specific weather condition. This enables the model to precisely and adaptively learn relevant features for each weather scenario, improving both efficiency and effectiveness without compromising on performance. This method constructs specific masks based on gradient fluctuations to isolate parameters influenced by other tasks, ensuring that the model achieves strong performance across all scenarios without adding extra parameters. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets.

However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images.

To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process.

Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by \textbf{even 0.35dB} PSNR for lightweight SR even with \textbf{9.3\% less} parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by \textbf{up to 0.29dB}.

Specifically, by establishing a direct correspondence between algorithm operators at each implementation step and network modules within each layer, one can rationally construct an almost ``white box'' network architecture with high interpretability. In this architecture, only the predefined component of the proximal operator, known as a proximal network, needs manual configuration, enabling the network to automatically extract intrinsic image priors in a data-driven manner. In current deep unfolding methods, such a proximal network is generally designed as a CNN architecture, whose necessity has been proven by a recent theory. That is, CNN structure substantially delivers the translational invariant image prior, which is the most universally possessed structural prior across various types of images. However, standard CNN-based proximal networks have essential limitations in capturing the rotation symmetry prior, another universal structural prior underlying general images. This leaves a large room for further performance improvement in deep unfolding approaches. To address this issue, this study makes efforts to suggest a high-accuracy rotation equivariant proximal network that effectively embeds rotation symmetry priors into the deep unfolding framework. Especially, we deduce, for the first time, the theoretical equivariant error for such a designed proximal network with arbitrary layers under arbitrary rotation degrees. This analysis should be the most refined theoretical conclusion for such error evaluation to date and is also indispensable for supporting the rationale behind such networks with intrinsic interpretability requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose TSFormer, an all-in-one framework that integrates \textbf{T}rusted learning with \textbf{S}parsification to boost both generalization capability and computational efficiency in UHD image restoration. The key is that only a small amount of token movement is allowed within the model. To efficiently filter tokens, we use Min-$p$ with random matrix theory to quantify the uncertainty of tokens, thereby improving the robustness of the model. Our model can run a 4K image in real time (40fps) with 3.38 M parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSFormer achieves state-of-the-art restoration quality while enhancing generalization and reducing computational demands. In addition, our token filtering method can be applied to other image restoration models to effectively accelerate inference and maintain performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, denoising diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis. Guided diffusion models, leveraging the potent generative priors of pre-trained models along with a differential guidance loss, have achieved promising results in blind image restoration. However, these models typically consider data consistency solely in the spatial domain, often resulting in distorted image content. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-aware guidance loss that can be integrated into various diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Our proposed guidance loss, based on 2D discrete wavelet transform, simultaneously enforces content consistency in both the spatial and frequency domains. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in three blind restoration tasks: blind image deblurring, imaging through turbulence, and blind restoration for multiple degradations. Notably, our method achieves a significant improvement in PSNR score, with a remarkable enhancement of 3.72\,dB in image deblurring. Moreover, our method exhibits superior capability in generating images with rich details and reduced distortion, leading to the best visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, has been accepted by the ECCV 2024: AIM workshop</p></details> |

However, because cataract patients may also suffer from other blinding eye diseases, ophthalmologists must diagnose them before surgery. The cloudy lens of cataract patients forms a hazy degeneration in the fundus images, making it challenging to observe the patient's fundus vessels, which brings difficulties to the diagnosis process. To address this issue, this paper establishes a new cataract image restoration method named Catintell. It contains a cataract image synthesizing model, Catintell-Syn, and a restoration model, Catintell-Res. Catintell-Syn uses GAN architecture with fully unsupervised data to generate paired cataract-like images with realistic style and texture rather than the conventional Gaussian degradation algorithm. Meanwhile, Catintell-Res is an image restoration network that can improve the quality of real cataract fundus images using the knowledge learned from synthetic cataract images. Extensive experiments show that Catintell-Res outperforms other cataract image restoration methods in PSNR with 39.03 and SSIM with 0.9476. Furthermore, the universal restoration ability that Catintell-Res gained from unpaired cataract images can process cataract images from various datasets. We hope the models can help ophthalmologists identify other blinding eye diseases of cataract patients and inspire more medical image restoration methods in the future.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various unknown degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different types of degradation, forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration plug-and-play method that generates parameters based on the input image and thus makes the model to adapt to specific degradation dynamically. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and All-in-One settings. Notably, our proposed model Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve a given small enough error, our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to mainstream embedding-based All-in-One methods.

However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for better restoration, we propose a new Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines both channel attention and window-based self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a same-task pre-training strategy to further exploit the potential of the model for further improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We further scale up the model to show that the performance of the SR task can be greatly improved. Besides, we extend HAT to more image restoration applications, including real-world image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising and image compression artifacts reduction. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that our HAT achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Nevertheless, handling the complex and diverse degradations encountered in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To tackle this, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network. In the fine-tuning stage, we refine the pre-trained IR network through low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Built upon a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, LoRA-IR dynamically integrates multiple low-rank restoration experts through a degradation-guided router. This dynamic integration mechanism significantly enhances our model's adaptability to diverse and unknown degradations in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-IR achieves SOTA performance across 14 IR tasks and 29 benchmarks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Code and pre-trained models will be available at: https://github.com/shallowdream204/LoRA-IR.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically handle single or composite degradations based on scene descriptors derived from text or image embeddings. However, due to the varying proportions of different degradations within an image, these scene descriptors may not accurately differentiate between degradations, leading to suboptimal restoration in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based restoration framework, AllRestorer. In AllRestorer, we enable the model to adaptively consider all image impairments, thereby avoiding errors from scene descriptor misdirection. Specifically, we introduce an All-in-One Transformer Block (AiOTB), which adaptively removes all degradations present in a given image by modeling the relationships between all degradations and the image embedding in latent space. To accurately address different variations potentially present within the same type of degradation and minimize ambiguity, AiOTB utilizes a composite scene descriptor consisting of both image and text embeddings to define the degradation. Furthermore, AiOTB includes an adaptive weight for each degradation, allowing for precise control of the restoration intensity. By leveraging AiOTB, AllRestorer avoids misdirection caused by inaccurate scene descriptors, achieving a 5.00 dB increase in PSNR compared to the baseline on the CDD-11 dataset.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

We propose the Probabilistic Prior Turbulence Removal Network (PPTRN), which combines probabilistic diffusion-based prior modeling with Transformer-driven feature extraction to address this issue. PPTRN employs a two-stage approach: first, a latent encoder and Transformer are jointly trained on clear images to establish robust feature representations. Then, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) models prior distributions over latent vectors, guiding the Transformer in capturing diverse feature variations essential for restoration. A key innovation in PPTRN is the Probabilistic Prior Driven Cross Attention mechanism, which integrates the DDPM-generated prior with feature embeddings to reduce artifacts and enhance spatial coherence. Extensive experiments validate that PPTRN significantly improves restoration quality on turbulence-degraded images, setting a new benchmark in clarity and structural fidelity.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 3 tables |

Current image restoration methods struggle to handle complex degradation while maintaining efficiency. This paper introduces a novel image restoration architecture that combines multi-dimensional dynamic attention and self-attention within a U-Net framework. To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks.

To this end, we develop an adaptive degradation-aware self-prompting model (ADSM) for all-in-one weather-degraded image restoration. Specifically, our model employs the contrastive language-image pre-training model (CLIP) to facilitate the training of our proposed latent prompt generators (LPGs), which represent three types of latent prompts to characterize the degradation type, degradation property and image caption. Moreover, we integrate the acquired degradation-aware prompts into the time embedding of diffusion model to improve degradation perception. Meanwhile, we employ the latent caption prompt to guide the reverse sampling process using the cross-attention mechanism, thereby guiding the accurate image reconstruction. Furthermore, to accelerate the reverse sampling procedure of diffusion model and address the limitations of frequency perception, we introduce a wavelet-oriented noise estimating network (WNE-Net). Extensive experiments conducted on eight publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both task-specific and all-in-one applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing algorithms often fail to effectively integrate multi-scale feature extraction with frequency enhancement, limiting their ability to reconstruct fine textures. Additionally, non-uniform blur in images also restricts the effectiveness of image restoration. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale frequency enhancement network (MFENet) for blind image deblurring. To capture the multi-scale spatial and channel information of blurred images, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction module (MS-FE) based on depthwise separable convolutions, which provides rich target features for deblurring. We propose a frequency enhanced blur perception module (FEBP) that employs wavelet transforms to extract high-frequency details and utilizes multi-strip pooling to perceive non-uniform blur, combining multi-scale information with frequency enhancement to improve the restoration of image texture details. Experimental results on the GoPro and HIDE datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior deblurring performance in both visual quality and objective evaluation metrics. Furthermore, in downstream object detection tasks, the proposed blind image deblurring algorithm significantly improves detection accuracy, further validating its effectiveness androbustness in the field of image deblurring.</p></details> |  |

The restoration of UHD images is a highly challenging problem due to the exaggerated pixel count, which often leads to memory overflow during processing. Existing methods either downsample UHD images at a high rate before processing or split them into multiple patches for separate processing. However, high-rate downsampling leads to significant information loss, while patch-based approaches inevitably introduce boundary artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel design paradigm to solve the UHD image restoration problem, called D2Net. D2Net enables direct full-resolution inference on UHD images without the need for high-rate downsampling or dividing the images into several patches. Specifically, we ingeniously utilize the characteristics of the frequency domain to establish long-range dependencies of features. Taking into account the richer local patterns in UHD images, we also design a multi-scale convolutional group to capture local features. Additionally, during the decoding stage, we dynamically incorporate features from the encoding stage to reduce the flow of irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on three UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring, show that our model achieves better quantitative and qualitative results than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | WACV2025 |

However, the task-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational costs related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging to use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This hinders their wider adoption, especially by those who lack access to powerful computational resources and vast amount of training data. In this work we aim to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the performance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a relatively small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest. Moreover, the architecture of the proposed framework allows for a sampling strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function evaluations without suffering any performance loss, while it can also be combined with existing acceleration techniques such as DDIM. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality while it retains a competitive performance with respect to fidelity metrics.</p></details> |  |

This incurs a significant network burden that only centralized, monolithic clusters can support, driving up infrastructure costs and straining power systems. We propose Decentralized Diffusion Models, a scalable framework for distributing diffusion model training across independent clusters or datacenters by eliminating the dependence on a centralized, high-bandwidth networking fabric. Our method trains a set of expert diffusion models over partitions of the dataset, each in full isolation from one another. At inference time, the experts ensemble through a lightweight router. We show that the ensemble collectively optimizes the same objective as a single model trained over the whole dataset. This means we can divide the training burden among a number of "compute islands," lowering infrastructure costs and improving resilience to localized GPU failures. Decentralized diffusion models empower researchers to take advantage of smaller, more cost-effective and more readily available compute like on-demand GPU nodes rather than central integrated systems. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and LAION Aesthetics, showing that decentralized diffusion models FLOP-for-FLOP outperform standard diffusion models. We finally scale our approach to 24 billion parameters, demonstrating that high-quality diffusion models can now be trained with just eight individual GPU nodes in less than a week.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://decentralizeddiffusion.github.io/</p></details> |

Most of the literature has focused on fMRI-to-Image tasks as fMRI is characterized by high spatial resolution. However, fMRI is an expensive neuroimaging modality and does not allow for real-time BCI. On the other hand, electroencephalography (EEG) is a low-cost, non-invasive, and portable neuroimaging technique, making it an attractive option for future real-time applications. Nevertheless, EEG presents inherent challenges due to its low spatial resolution and susceptibility to noise and artifacts, which makes generating images from EEG more difficult. In this paper, we address these problems with a streamlined framework based on the ControlNet adapter for conditioning a latent diffusion model (LDM) through EEG signals. We conduct experiments and ablation studies on popular benchmarks to demonstrate that the proposed method beats other state-of-the-art models. Unlike these methods, which often require extensive preprocessing, pretraining, different losses, and captioning models, our approach is efficient and straightforward, requiring only minimal preprocessing and a few components.

However, the ease of text-based image editing introduces significant risks, such as malicious editing for scams or intellectual property infringement. Previous works have attempted to safeguard images from diffusion-based editing by adding imperceptible perturbations. These methods are costly and specifically target prevalent Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), while Pixel-domain Diffusion Models (PDMs) remain largely unexplored and robust against such attacks. Our work addresses this gap by proposing a novel attack framework, AtkPDM. AtkPDM is mainly composed of a feature representation attacking loss that exploits vulnerabilities in denoising UNets and a latent optimization strategy to enhance the naturalness of adversarial images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in attacking dominant PDM-based editing methods (e.g., SDEdit) while maintaining reasonable fidelity and robustness against common defense methods. Additionally, our framework is extensible to LDMs, achieving comparable performance to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Our method leverages ControlNet to condition from intrinsic images and combines it with a Stable Diffusion model to utilize its scene priors, together operating as an effective rendering engine. During training, ZeroComp uses intrinsic images based on geometry, albedo, and masked shading, all without the need for paired images of scenes with and without composite objects.

Although existing methods produce high-quality outputs, they often fail to faithfully preserve the individual's identity. In this paper, we propose a personalized face restoration method, FaceMe, based on a diffusion model. Given a single or a few reference images, we use an identity encoder to extract identity-related features, which serve as prompts to guide the diffusion model in restoring high-quality and identity-consistent facial images. By simply combining identity-related features, we effectively minimize the impact of identity-irrelevant features during training and support any number of reference image inputs during inference. Additionally, thanks to the robustness of the identity encoder, synthesized images can be used as reference images during training, and identity changing during inference does not require fine-tuning the model. We also propose a pipeline for constructing a reference image training pool that simulates the poses and expressions that may appear in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our FaceMe can restore high-quality facial images while maintaining identity consistency, achieving excellent performance and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

In parallel, augmentation approaches can also be used for editing/modifying a given image in a context- and semantics-aware way. Diffusion Models (DMs), which comprise one of the most recent and highly promising classes of methods in the field of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), have emerged as a powerful tool for image data augmentation, capable of generating realistic and diverse images by learning the underlying data distribution. The current study realizes a systematic, comprehensive and in-depth review of DM-based approaches for image augmentation, covering a wide range of strategies, tasks and applications. In particular, a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental principles, model architectures and training strategies of DMs is initially performed. Subsequently, a taxonomy of the relevant image augmentation methods is introduced, focusing on techniques regarding semantic manipulation, personalization and adaptation, and application-specific augmentation tasks. Then, performance assessment methodologies and respective evaluation metrics are analyzed. Finally, current challenges and future research directions in the field are discussed.</p></details> | 65 pages, 15 figures |

While current approaches report high diversity and realism, they often generate motions with undetected limb stretching and jitter. To address this, we introduce SkeletonDiffusion, a latent diffusion model that embeds an explicit inductive bias on the human body within its architecture and training. Our model is trained with a novel nonisotropic Gaussian diffusion formulation that aligns with the natural kinematic structure of the human skeleton. Results show that our approach outperforms conventional isotropic alternatives, consistently generating realistic predictions while avoiding artifacts such as limb distortion. Additionally, we identify a limitation in commonly used diversity metrics, which may inadvertently favor models that produce inconsistent limb lengths within the same sequence. SkeletonDiffusion sets a new benchmark on three real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

(3) We reproject the initial image to subsequent frames and use the resulting video as a condition. (4) We use 2D<=>3D transformers to introduce a global 3D representation, which implicitly conditions on the camera poses. We combine all conditions in a ContolNet-style architecture. We then propose a metric that evaluates overall video quality and the ability to preserve details with view changes, which we use to analyze the trade-offs of individual and combined conditions.

The synthetic genotypes mimic real human genotypes without just reproducing known genotypes, in terms of approved metrics. When training biomedically relevant classifiers with synthetic genotypes, accuracy is near-identical to the accuracy achieved when training classifiers with real data. We further demonstrate that augmenting small amounts of real with synthetically generated genotypes drastically improves performance rates. This addresses a significant challenge in translational human genetics: real human genotypes, although emerging in large volumes from genome wide association studies, are sensitive private data, which limits their public availability. Therefore, the integration of additional, insensitive data when striving for rapid sharing of biomedical knowledge of public interest appears imperative.</p></details> |  |

Most of existing methods produce plausible reconstructions when the gap lengths are short, but struggle to reconstruct gaps larger than about 100 ms. This paper explores recent advancements in deep learning and, particularly, diffusion models, for the task of audio inpainting. The proposed method uses an unconditionally trained generative model, which can be conditioned in a zero-shot fashion for audio inpainting, and is able to regenerate gaps of any size. An improved deep neural network architecture based on the constant-Q transform, which allows the model to exploit pitch-equivariant symmetries in audio, is also presented. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through objective and subjective metrics for the task of reconstructing short to mid-sized gaps, up to 300 ms. The results of a formal listening test show that the proposed method delivers comparable performance against the compared baselines for short gaps, such as 50 ms, while retaining a good audio quality and outperforming the baselines for wider gaps that are up to 300 ms long. The method presented in this paper can be applied to restoring sound recordings that suffer from severe local disturbances or dropouts, which must be reconstructed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication to the Journal of Audio Engineering Society on January 30th, 2023</p></details> |

While high-quality visual text generation has become available with the advanced generative capabilities of diffusion models, these models often produce distorted text and inharmonious text background when given slanted or curved text layouts due to training data limitation. In this paper, we introduce a new training-free framework, STGen, which accurately generates visual texts in challenging scenarios (\eg, slanted or curved text layouts) while harmonizing them with the text background. Our framework decomposes the visual text generation process into two branches: (i) \textbf{Semantic Rectification Branch}, which leverages the ability in generating flat but accurate visual texts of the model to guide the generation of challenging scenarios. The generated latent of flat text is abundant in accurate semantic information related both to the text itself and its background. By incorporating this, we rectify the semantic information of the texts and harmonize the integration of the text with its background in complex layouts. (ii) \textbf{Structure Injection Branch}, which reinforces the visual text structure during inference. We incorporate the latent information of the glyph image, rich in glyph structure, as a new condition to further strengthen the text structure. To enhance image harmony, we also apply an effective combination method to merge the priors, providing a solid foundation for generation. Extensive experiments across a variety of visual text layouts demonstrate that our framework achieves superior accuracy and outstanding quality.</p></details> |  |

They use an extra reference network or an additional image encoder to process multiple conditional image inputs, which adds complexity pre-processing and additional computational costs. Besides, they require more than 25 inference steps, bringing longer inference time. In this work, with the development of diffusion transformer (DiT), we rethink the necessity of additional reference network or image encoder and introduce MC-VTON, which leverages DiT's intrinsic backbone to seamlessly integrate minimal conditional try-on inputs. Compared to existing methods, the superiority of MC-VTON is demonstrated in four aspects: (1) Superior detail fidelity. Our DiT-based MC-VTON exhibits superior fidelity in preserving fine-grained details. (2) Simplified network and inputs. We remove any extra reference network or image encoder. We also remove unnecessary conditions like the long prompt, pose estimation, human parsing, and depth map. We require only the masked person image and the garment image. (3) Parameter-efficient training. To process the try-on task, we fine-tune the FLUX.1-dev with only 39.7M additional parameters (0.33% of the backbone parameters). (4) Less inference steps. We apply distillation diffusion on MC-VTON and only need 8 steps to generate a realistic try-on image, with only 86.8M additional parameters (0.72% of the backbone parameters). Experiments show that MC-VTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results with fewer condition inputs, trainable parameters, and inference steps than baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Poems are a distinct form of literature, with meanings that frequently transcend beyond the literal words. To address this shortcoming, we propose a PoemToPixel framework designed to generate images that visually represent the inherent meanings of poems. Our approach incorporates the concept of prompt tuning in our image generation framework to ensure that the resulting images closely align with the poetic content. In addition, we propose the PoeKey algorithm, which extracts three key elements in the form of emotions, visual elements, and themes from poems to form instructions which are subsequently provided to a diffusion model for generating corresponding images. Furthermore, to expand the diversity of the poetry dataset across different genres and ages, we introduce MiniPo, a novel multimodal dataset comprising 1001 children's poems and images. Leveraging this dataset alongside PoemSum, we conducted both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of image generation using our PoemToPixel framework. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and offers a fresh perspective on generating images from literary sources.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges in decision-making and digital modeling continue to impede their rapid advancement. Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms face limitations such as low sample efficiency and limited data versatility, further magnified in UAV communication scenarios. Moreover, Digital Twin (DT) modeling introduces substantial decision-making and data management complexities. RL models, often integrated into DT frameworks, require extensive training data to achieve accurate predictions. In contrast to traditional approaches that focus on class boundaries, Diffusion Models (DMs), a new class of generative AI, learn the underlying probability distribution from the training data and can generate trustworthy new patterns based on this learned distribution. This paper explores the integration of DMs with RL and DT to effectively address these challenges. By combining the data generation capabilities of DMs with the decision-making framework of RL and the modeling accuracy of DT, the integration improves the adaptability and real-time performance of UAV communication. Moreover, the study shows how DMs can alleviate data scarcity, improve policy networks, and optimize dynamic modeling, providing a robust solution for complex UAV communication scenarios.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

Existing fine-tuning methods often suffer from reward over-optimization, while approximate guidance approaches fail to optimize target rewards effectively. Addressing these limitations, we propose a training-free sampling method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution. Our approach, tailored for diffusion sampling and incorporating tempering techniques, achieves comparable or superior target rewards to fine-tuning methods while preserving diversity and cross-reward generalization. We demonstrate its effectiveness in single-reward optimization, multi-objective scenarios, and online black-box optimization. This work offers a robust solution for aligning diffusion models with diverse downstream objectives without compromising their general capabilities.

Despite the existing techniques aiming to accelerate sampling, they often compromise performance when fusing multi-source images. To ease this limitation, we introduce a novel and efficient diffusion model named Diffusion Model for Pansharpening by Inferring Residual Inference (ResPanDiff), which significantly reduces the number of diffusion steps without sacrificing the performance to tackle pansharpening task. In ResPanDiff, we innovatively propose a Markov chain that transits from noisy residuals to the residuals between the LRMS and HRMS images, thereby reducing the number of sampling steps and enhancing performance. Additionally, we design the latent space to help model extract more features at the encoding stage, Shallow Cond-Injection~(SC-I) to help model fetch cond-injected hidden features with higher dimensions, and loss functions to give a better guidance for the residual generation task. enabling the model to achieve superior performance in residual generation. Furthermore, experimental evaluations on pansharpening datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior outcomes compared to recent state-of-the-art~(SOTA) techniques, requiring only 15 sampling steps, which reduces over $90\%$ step compared with the benchmark diffusion models. Our experiments also include thorough discussions and ablation studies to underscore the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent non-linearity and ill-conditioned nature of the EIT inverse problem, the reconstructed image is highly sensitive to the measured data, and random noise artifacts often appear in the reconstructed image, which greatly limits the application of EIT. To address this issue, a conditional diffusion model with voltage consistency (CDMVC) is proposed in this study. The method consists of a pre-imaging module, a conditional diffusion model for reconstruction, a forward voltage constraint network and a scheme of voltage consistency constraint during sampling process. The pre-imaging module is employed to generate the initial reconstruction. This serves as a condition for training the conditional diffusion model. Finally, based on the forward voltage constraint network, a voltage consistency constraint is implemented in the sampling phase to incorporate forward information of EIT, thereby enhancing imaging quality. A more complete dataset, including both common and complex concave shapes, is generated. The proposed method is validated using both simulation and physical experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improves the quality of reconstructed images. In addition, experimental results also demonstrate that our method has good robustness and generalization performance.</p></details> |  |

However, due to compute limitations, each inference with these large models is confined to a small area, making long-range consistent scene generation challenging. To address this, we propose StarGen, a novel framework that employs a pre-trained video diffusion model in an autoregressive manner for long-range scene generation. The generation of each video clip is conditioned on the 3D warping of spatially adjacent images and the temporally overlapping image from previously generated clips, improving spatiotemporal consistency in long-range scene generation with precise pose control. The spatiotemporal condition is compatible with various input conditions, facilitating diverse tasks, including sparse view interpolation, perpetual view generation, and layout-conditioned city generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate StarGen's superior scalability, fidelity, and pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as one of the core technologies of the LAE, can be deployed to provide communication coverage, facilitate data collection, and relay data for trapped users, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of post-disaster response efforts. In this paper, we design an efficient and robust UAV-swarm enabled collaborative self-organizing network to facilitate post-disaster communications. Specifically, a ground device transmits data to UAV swarms, which then use collaborative beamforming (CB) technique to form virtual antenna arrays and relay the data to a remote access point (AP) efficiently. Then, we formulate a rescue-oriented post-disaster transmission rate maximization optimization problem (RPTRMOP). Then, we propose a two-stage optimization approach to address it. In the first stage, the optimal traffic routing and the theoretical upper bound on the transmission rate of the network are derived. In the second stage, we transform the formulated RPTRMOP into a variant named V-RPTRMOP, and a diffusion model-enabled particle swarm optimization (DM-PSO) algorithm is proposed to deal with the V-RPTRMOP. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage optimization approach in improving the transmission rate of the constructed network, which demonstrates the great potential for post-disaster communications. Moreover, the robustness of the constructed network is also validated via evaluating the impact of two unexpected situations on the system transmission rate.</p></details> |  |

For example, we can decompose an image into low and high spatial frequencies and condition these components on different text prompts. This produces hybrid images, which change appearance depending on viewing distance. By decomposing an image into three frequency subbands, we can generate hybrid images with three prompts. We also use a decomposition into grayscale and color components to produce images whose appearance changes when they are viewed in grayscale, a phenomena that naturally occurs under dim lighting. And we explore a decomposition by a motion blur kernel, which produces images that change appearance under motion blurring. Our method works by denoising with a composite noise estimate, built from the components of noise estimates conditioned on different prompts. We also show that for certain decompositions, our method recovers prior approaches to compositional generation and spatial control. Finally, we show that we can extend our approach to generate hybrid images from real images. We do this by holding one component fixed and generating the remaining components, effectively solving an inverse problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 camera ready version + more readable size</p></details> |

Despite their capabilities, they face challenges in computing, such as excessive latency and energy consumption due to their iterative architecture. Although prior works specialized in transformer acceleration can be applied, the iterative nature of diffusion models remains unresolved. In this paper, we present EXION, the first SW-HW co-designed diffusion accelerator that solves the computation challenges by exploiting the unique inter- and intra-iteration output sparsity in diffusion models. To this end, we propose two SW-level optimizations. First, we introduce the FFN-Reuse algorithm that identifies and skips redundant computations in FFN layers across different iterations (inter-iteration sparsity). Second, we use a modified eager prediction method that employs two-step leading-one detection to accurately predict the attention score, skipping unnecessary computations within an iteration (intra-iteration sparsity). We also introduce a novel data compaction mechanism named ConMerge, which can enhance HW utilization by condensing and merging sparse matrices into compact forms. Finally, it has a dedicated HW architecture that supports the above sparsity-inducing algorithms, translating high output sparsity into improved energy efficiency and performance. To verify the feasibility of the EXION, we first demonstrate that it has no impact on accuracy in various types of multi-modal diffusion models. We then instantiate EXION in both server- and edge-level settings and compare its performance against GPUs with similar specifications. Our evaluation shows that EXION achieves dramatic improvements in performance and energy efficiency by 3.2-379.3x and 45.1-3067.6x compared to a server GPU and by 42.6-1090.9x and 196.9-4668.2x compared to an edge GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 2025 IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2025)</p></details> |

To deal with sequential arrivals of SFCs in an online fashion, we must consider two closely-coupled problems - an SFC placement problem that maps SFCs to servers/links in the network and an SFC scheduling problem that determines when each SFC is executed. Solving the whole SFC problem targeting these two optimizations jointly is extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel network diffuser using conditional generative modeling for this SFC placing-scheduling optimization. Recent advances in generative AI and diffusion models have made it possible to generate high-quality images/videos and decision trajectories from language description. We formulate the SFC optimization as a problem of generating a state sequence for planning and perform graph diffusion on the state trajectories to enable extraction of SFC decisions, with SFC optimization constraints and objectives as conditions. To address the lack of demonstration data due to NP-hardness and exponential problem space of the SFC optimization, we also propose a novel and somewhat maverick approach -- Rather than solving instances of this difficult optimization, we start with randomly-generated solutions as input, and then determine appropriate SFC optimization problems that render these solutions feasible. This inverse demonstration enables us to obtain sufficient expert demonstrations, i.e., problem-solution pairs, through further optimization. In our numerical evaluations, the proposed network diffuser outperforms learning and heuristic baselines, by $\sim$20\% improvement in SFC reward and $\sim$50\% reduction in SFC waiting time and blocking rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE INFOCOM 2025</p></details> |

Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

As a result, developing effective methods for detecting AI-generated fakes has become a pressing concern. In our research, we propose HFMF, a comprehensive two-stage deepfake detection framework that leverages both hierarchical cross-modal feature fusion and multi-stream feature extraction to enhance detection performance against imagery produced by state-of-the-art generative AI models. The first component of our approach integrates vision Transformers and convolutional nets through a hierarchical feature fusion mechanism. The second component of our framework combines object-level information and a fine-tuned convolutional net model.

While impressive, the images often fall short of depicting subtle details and are susceptible to errors due to ambiguity in the input text. One way of alleviating these issues is to train diffusion models on class-labeled datasets. This approach has two disadvantages: (i) supervised datasets are generally small compared to large-scale scraped text-image datasets on which text-to-image models are trained, affecting the quality and diversity of the generated images, or (ii) the input is a hard-coded label, as opposed to free-form text, limiting the control over the generated images. In this work, we propose a non-invasive fine-tuning technique that capitalizes on the expressive potential of free-form text while achieving high accuracy through discriminative signals from a pretrained classifier. This is done by iteratively modifying the embedding of an added input token of a text-to-image diffusion model, by steering generated images toward a given target class according to a classifier. Our method is fast compared to prior fine-tuning methods and does not require a collection of in-class images or retraining of a noise-tolerant classifier. We evaluate our method extensively, showing that the generated images are: (i) more accurate and of higher quality than standard diffusion models, (ii) can be used to augment training data in a low-resource setting, and (iii) reveal information about the data used to train the guiding classifier.

In this work, we propose an alternative approach to enhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of temporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of high-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that high-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression models. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped high-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression blocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a cross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained low-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the remaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks shows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while increasing temporal compression compared to direct extensions of existing video tokenizers. Furthermore, the resulting compact latent space effectively trains a video diffusion model for high-quality video generation with a reduced token budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://progressive-video-tokenizer.github.io/Pro-MAG/</p></details> |

We provide evidence against this claim and build a modern GAN baseline in a more principled manner. First, we derive a well-behaved regularized relativistic GAN loss that addresses issues of mode dropping and non-convergence that were previously tackled via a bag of ad-hoc tricks. We analyze our loss mathematically and prove that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike most existing relativistic losses. Second, our new loss allows us to discard all ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common GANs with modern architectures. Using StyleGAN2 as an example, we present a roadmap of simplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline -- R3GAN. Despite being simple, our approach surpasses StyleGAN2 on FFHQ, ImageNet, CIFAR, and Stacked MNIST datasets, and compares favorably against state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024.

However, direct 3D generation is still constrained by the scarcity and lower fidelity of 3D datasets. In this paper, we introduce Zero-1-to-G, a novel approach that addresses this problem by enabling direct single-view generation on Gaussian splats using pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our key insight is that Gaussian splats, a 3D representation, can be decomposed into multi-view images encoding different attributes. This reframes the challenging task of direct 3D generation within a 2D diffusion framework, allowing us to leverage the rich priors of pretrained 2D diffusion models. To incorporate 3D awareness, we introduce cross-view and cross-attribute attention layers, which capture complex correlations and enforce 3D consistency across generated splats. This makes Zero-1-to-G the first direct image-to-3D generative model to effectively utilize pretrained 2D diffusion priors, enabling efficient training and improved generalization to unseen objects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate superior performance in 3D object generation, offering a new approach to high-quality 3D generation.</p></details> |  |

Most existing time series generation models are typically designed to generate data from one specified domain. While leveraging data from other domain for better generalization is proved to work in other application areas, this approach remains challenging for time series modeling due to the large divergence in patterns among different real world time series categories. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain time series diffusion model with domain prompts, named TimeDP. In TimeDP, we utilize a time series semantic prototype module which defines time series prototypes to represent time series basis, each prototype vector serving as "word" representing some elementary time series feature. A prototype assignment module is applied to extract the extract domain specific prototype weights, for learning domain prompts as generation condition. During sampling, we extract "domain prompt" with few-shot samples from the target domain and use the domain prompts as condition to generate time series samples. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines to provide the state-of-the-art in-domain generation quality and strong unseen domain generation capability.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

While speculative sampling was previously limited to discrete sequences, we extend it to diffusion models, which generate samples via continuous, vector-valued Markov chains. In this context, the target model is a high-quality but computationally expensive diffusion model. We propose various drafting strategies, including a simple and effective approach that does not require training a draft model and is applicable out of the box to any diffusion model. Our experiments demonstrate significant generation speedup on various diffusion models, halving the number of function evaluations, while generating exact samples from the target model.</p></details> |  |

This raises concerns about the potential abuse of image generation, such as the creation of explicit or violent images, commonly referred to as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. To address this, the Stable Diffusion model includes several safety checkers to censor initial text prompts and final output images generated from the model. However, recent research has shown that these safety checkers have vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks, allowing them to generate NSFW images. In this paper, we find that these adversarial attacks are not robust to small changes in text prompts or input latents. Based on this, we propose CROPS (Circular or RandOm Prompts for Safety), a model-agnostic framework that easily defends against adversarial attacks generating NSFW images without requiring additional training. Moreover, we develop an approach that utilizes one-step diffusion models for efficient NSFW detection (CROPS-1), further reducing computational resources. We demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of performance and applicability.</p></details> |  |

We model the unknown distribution of volumetric fields using an unconditional diffusion model trained on a novel benchmark dataset comprising 1,000 synthetically simulated volumetric density fields. The neural diffusion model is trained on the latent codes of a novel, diffusion-friendly, monoplanar representation. The generative model is used to incorporate a tailored parametric diffusion posterior sampling technique into different reconstruction tasks. A physically-based differentiable volume renderer is employed to provide gradients with respect to light transport in the latent space. This stands in contrast to classic NeRF approaches and makes the reconstructions better aligned with observed data. Through various experiments, we demonstrate single-view reconstruction of volumetric clouds at a previously unattainable quality.</p></details> |  |

Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative approach that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this inference task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, additional supplementary text and figures</p></details> |

Recently developed deep learning methods, particularly diffusion models have reached competitive performance over traditional cheminformatical approaches. However, these methods are often time-consuming or require extra support from traditional methods. We propose EquiBoost, a boosting model that stacks several equivariant graph transformers as weak learners, to iteratively refine 3D conformations of molecules. Without relying on diffusion techniques, EquiBoost balances accuracy and efficiency more effectively than diffusion-based methods. Notably, compared to the previous state-of-the-art diffusion method, EquiBoost improves generation quality and preserves diversity, achieving considerably better precision of Average Minimum RMSD (AMR) on the GEOM datasets. This work rejuvenates boosting and sheds light on its potential to be a robust alternative to diffusion models in certain scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, its adaptation in medical settings still faces significant challenges, related to data availability and privacy constraints. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues, addressing data scarcity while preserving privacy. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality synthetic data. Meanwhile, the integration of different modalities has gained interest, emphasizing the need of models capable of handle multimodal medical data. Existing approaches struggle to integrate complementary information and lack the ability to generate modalities simultaneously. To address this challenge, we present MedCoDi-M, a 6.77-billion-parameter model, designed for multimodal medical data generation, that, following Foundation Model paradigm, exploits contrastive learning and large quantity of data to build a shared latent space which capture the relationships between different data modalities. Further, we introduce the Multi-Prompt training technique, which significantly boosts MedCoDi-M's generation under different settings. We extensively validate MedCoDi-M: first we benchmark it against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset for Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world scenarios. Finally, we assess the utility of MedCoDi-M in addressing key challenges in the medical field, such as anonymization, data scarcity and imbalance learning. The results are promising, demonstrating the applicability of MedCoDi-M in medical contexts. Project page is at https://cosbidev.github.io/MedCoDi-M/.</p></details> |  |

This enables us to edit this specific person's expression in a fine-grained, continuous and interpretable manner, while preserving their identity, pose, background and detailed facial attributes. Key to our model, which we dub MagicFace, is a diffusion model conditioned on AU variations and an ID encoder to preserve facial details of high consistency. Specifically, to preserve the facial details with the input identity, we leverage the power of pretrained Stable-Diffusion models and design an ID encoder to merge appearance features through self-attention. To keep background and pose consistency, we introduce an efficient Attribute Controller by explicitly informing the model of current background and pose of the target. By injecting AU variations into a denoising UNet, our model can animate arbitrary identities with various AU combinations, yielding superior results in high-fidelity expression editing compared to other facial expression editing works.

However, precise control over the video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled video generation are typically limited to a single control type, lacking the flexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video control tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving versatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos are fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control inputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation allows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the 3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their ability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal consistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800 GPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities across diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control, motion transfer, and object manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://igl-hkust.github.io/das/ Codes: https://github.com/IGL-HKUST/DiffusionAsShader</p></details> |

One promising solution is to finetune the pre-trained 2D diffusion models to produce multi-view images and then reconstruct them into 3D assets via feed-forward sparse-view reconstruction models. However, limited by the 3D inconsistency in the generated multi-view images and the low reconstruction resolution of the feed-forward reconstruction models, the generated 3d assets are still limited to incorrect geometries and blurry textures. To address this problem, we present a multi-view based refine method, named Magic-Boost, to further refine the generation results. In detail, we first propose a novel multi-view conditioned diffusion model which extracts 3d prior from the synthesized multi-view images to synthesize high-fidelity novel view images and then introduce a novel iterative-update strategy to adopt it to provide precise guidance to refine the coarse generated results through a fast optimization process. Conditioned on the strong 3d priors extracted from the synthesized multi-view images, Magic-Boost is capable of providing precise optimization guidance that well aligns with the coarse generated 3D assets, enriching the local detail in both geometry and texture within a short time ($\sim15$min). Extensive experiments show Magic-Boost greatly enhances the coarse generated inputs, generates high-quality 3D assets with rich geometric and textural details.

In this paper, we propose FLowHigh, a novel approach that integrates flow matching, a highly efficient generative model, into audio super-resolution. We also explore probability paths specially tailored for audio super-resolution, which effectively capture high-resolution audio distributions, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality.

The success of these approaches often relies on strong priors or learned statistical models. While recent diffusion model-based priors have shown great potential, previous methods typically ignore clinically available metadata (e.g. patient demographics, imaging parameters, slice-specific information). In practice, metadata contains meaningful cues about the anatomy and acquisition protocol, suggesting it could further constrain the reconstruction problem. In this work, we propose ContextMRI, a text-conditioned diffusion model for MRI that integrates granular metadata into the reconstruction process. We train a pixel-space diffusion model directly on minimally processed, complex-valued MRI images. During inference, metadata is converted into a structured text prompt and fed to the model via CLIP text embeddings. By conditioning the prior on metadata, we unlock more accurate reconstructions and show consistent gains across multiple datasets, acceleration factors, and undersampling patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that increasing the fidelity of metadata, ranging from slice location and contrast to patient age, sex, and pathology, systematically boosts reconstruction performance. This work highlights the untapped potential of leveraging clinical context for inverse problems and opens a new direction for metadata-driven MRI reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 figures.

However, because of the intractable nature of the score function of the likelihood term (i.e., $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t} p(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}_t)$), various samplers have been proposed in the literature that use different (more or less accurate) approximations of such a gradient to guide the diffusion process towards solutions that match the observations. In this work, I consider two sampling algorithms recently proposed under the name of Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and Pseudo-inverse Guided Diffusion Model (PGDM), respectively. In DSP, the guidance term used at each step of the reverse diffusion process is obtained by applying the adjoint of the modeling operator to the residual obtained from a one-step denoising estimate of the solution. On the other hand, PGDM utilizes a pseudo-inverse operator that originates from the fact that the one-step denoised solution is not assumed to be deterministic, rather modeled as a Gaussian distribution. Through an extensive set of numerical examples on two geophysical inverse problems (namely, seismic interpolation and seismic inversion), I show that two key aspects for the success of any measurement-guided diffusion process are: i) our ability to re-parametrize the inverse problem such that the sought after model is bounded between -1 and 1 (a pre-requisite for any diffusion model); ii) the choice of the training dataset used to learn the implicit prior that guides the reverse diffusion process. Numerical examples on synthetic and field datasets reveal that PGDM outperforms DPS in both scenarios at limited additional cost.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose EditAR, a single unified autoregressive framework for a variety of conditional image generation tasks, e.g., image editing, depth-to-image, edge-to-image, segmentation-to-image. The model takes both images and instructions as inputs, and predicts the edited images tokens in a vanilla next-token paradigm.

However, Multi-Concept Video Customization (MCVC) remains a significant challenge. We identify two key challenges in this task: 1) the identity decoupling problem, where directly adopting existing customization methods inevitably mix attributes when handling multiple concepts simultaneously, and 2) the scarcity of high-quality video-entity pairs, which is crucial for training such a model that represents and decouples various concepts well. To address these challenges, we introduce ConceptMaster, an innovative framework that effectively tackles the critical issues of identity decoupling while maintaining concept fidelity in customized videos. Specifically, we introduce a novel strategy of learning decoupled multi-concept embeddings that are injected into the diffusion models in a standalone manner, which effectively guarantees the quality of customized videos with multiple identities, even for highly similar visual concepts. To further overcome the scarcity of high-quality MCVC data, we carefully establish a data construction pipeline, which enables systematic collection of precise multi-concept video-entity data across diverse concepts. A comprehensive benchmark is designed to validate the effectiveness of our model from three critical dimensions: concept fidelity, identity decoupling ability, and video generation quality across six different concept composition scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ConceptMaster significantly outperforms previous approaches for this task, paving the way for generating personalized and semantically accurate videos across multiple concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yuzhou914.github.io/ConceptMaster/</p></details> |

Recent works have diverged into two directions: regression-based modeling and generative modeling. Regression methods efficiently infer visible surfaces, but struggle with occluded regions. Generative methods handle uncertain regions better by modeling distributions, but are computationally expensive and the generation is often misaligned with visible surfaces. In this paper, we present SPAR3D, a novel two-stage approach aiming to take the best of both directions. The first stage of SPAR3D generates sparse 3D point clouds using a lightweight point diffusion model, which has a fast sampling speed. The second stage uses both the sampled point cloud and the input image to create highly detailed meshes. Our two-stage design enables probabilistic modeling of the ill-posed single-image 3D task while maintaining high computational efficiency and great output fidelity. Using point clouds as an intermediate representation further allows for interactive user edits. Evaluated on diverse datasets, SPAR3D demonstrates superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods, at an inference speed of 0.7 seconds.

However, these models usually suffer from sample inefficiency and high training costs. This issue is particularly pronounced in the standard diffusion transformer architecture due to its quadratic complexity relative to input length. Recent works have addressed this by reducing the number of tokens processed in the model, often through masking. In contrast, this work aims to improve the training efficiency of the diffusion backbone by using predefined routes that store this information until it is reintroduced to deeper layers of the model, rather than discarding these tokens entirely. Further, we combine multiple routes and introduce an adapted auxiliary loss that accounts for all applied routes. Our method is not limited to the common transformer-based model - it can also be applied to state-space models. Unlike most current approaches, TREAD achieves this without architectural modifications. Finally, we show that our method reduces the computational cost and simultaneously boosts model performance on the standard benchmark ImageNet-1K 256 x 256 in class-conditional synthesis. Both of these benefits multiply to a convergence speedup of 9.55x at 400K training iterations compared to DiT and 25.39x compared to the best benchmark performance of DiT at 7M training iterations.</p></details> |  |

While their practical benefits are widely acknowledged, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the contrastive pre-training framework remains limited. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain the success of contrastive pre-training in downstream tasks, such as zero-shot classification, conditional diffusion models, and vision-language models. We introduce the concept of approximate sufficient statistics, a generalization of the classical sufficient statistics, and show that near-minimizers of the contrastive pre-training loss are approximately sufficient, making them adaptable to diverse downstream tasks. We further propose the Joint Generative Hierarchical Model for the joint distribution of images and text, showing that transformers can efficiently approximate relevant functions within this model via belief propagation. Building on this framework, we derive sample complexity guarantees for multi-modal learning based on contrastive pre-trained representations. Numerical simulations validate these theoretical findings, demonstrating the strong generalization performance of contrastively pre-trained transformers in various multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | 108 pages |

Previous methods have achieved success in generating diverse digital avatars, however, generating avatars with disentangled components (\eg, body, hair, and clothes) has long been a challenge. In this paper, we propose LayerAvatar, the first feed-forward diffusion-based method for generating component-disentangled clothed avatars. To achieve this, we first propose a layered UV feature plane representation, where components are distributed in different layers of the Gaussian-based UV feature plane with corresponding semantic labels. This representation supports high-resolution and real-time rendering, as well as expressive animation including controllable gestures and facial expressions. Based on the well-designed representation, we train a single-stage diffusion model and introduce constrain terms to address the severe occlusion problem of the innermost human body layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive performances of our method in generating disentangled clothed avatars, and we further explore its applications in component transfer.

For this purpose, we analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function, whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional assumptions, and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an elegant explanation of why generative diffusion models are not affected by the manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time points during generation.</p></details> |  |

However, the frame-independence of T2I generation often results in poor temporal consistency. Existing methods address this issue through temporal layer fine-tuning or inference-based temporal propagation, but these approaches suffer from high training costs or limited temporal coherence. To address these challenges, we propose a General and Efficient Adapter (GE-Adapter) that integrates temporal-spatial and semantic consistency with Baliteral DDIM inversion. This framework introduces three key components: (1) Frame-based Temporal Consistency Blocks (FTC Blocks) to capture frame-specific features and enforce smooth inter-frame transitions via temporally-aware loss functions; (2) Channel-dependent Spatial Consistency Blocks (SCD Blocks) employing bilateral filters to enhance spatial coherence by reducing noise and artifacts; and (3) Token-based Semantic Consistency Module (TSC Module) to maintain semantic alignment using shared prompt tokens and frame-specific tokens. Our method significantly improves perceptual quality, text-image alignment, and temporal coherence, as demonstrated on the MSR-VTT dataset. Additionally, it achieves enhanced fidelity and frame-to-frame coherence, offering a practical solution for T2V editing.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods yield blurry-looking textures or rely on 3D training data that are hard to acquire. Regarding this, we propose PointDreamer, a novel framework for textured mesh reconstruction from colored point cloud via diffusion-based 2D inpainting. Specifically, we first reconstruct an untextured mesh. Next, we project the input point cloud into 2D space to generate sparse multi-view images, and then inpaint empty pixels utilizing a pre-trained 2D diffusion model. After that, we unproject the colors of the inpainted dense images onto the untextured mesh, thus obtaining the final textured mesh. This project-inpaint-unproject pipeline bridges the gap between 3D point clouds and 2D diffusion models for the first time. Thanks to the powerful 2D diffusion model pre-trained on extensive 2D data, PointDreamer reconstructs clear, high-quality textures with high robustness to sparse or noisy input. Also, it's zero-shot requiring no extra training. In addition, we design Non-Border-First unprojection strategy to address the border-area inconsistency issue, which is less explored but commonly-occurred in methods that generate 3D textures from multiview images. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various synthetic and real-scanned datasets show the SoTA performance of PointDreamer, by significantly outperforming baseline methods with 30% improvement in LPIPS score (from 0.118 to 0.068).

However, exerting control over the motion of objects in videos generated by any video diffusion model is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot moving object trajectory control framework, Motion-Zero, to enable a bounding-box-trajectories-controlled text-to-video diffusion model. To this end, an initial noise prior module is designed to provide a position-based prior to improve the stability of the appearance of the moving object and the accuracy of position. In addition, based on the attention map of the U-net, spatial constraints are directly applied to the denoising process of diffusion models, which further ensures the positional and spatial consistency of moving objects during the inference. Furthermore, temporal consistency is guaranteed with a proposed shift temporal attention mechanism. Our method can be flexibly applied to various state-of-the-art video diffusion models without any training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method can control the motion trajectories of objects and generate high-quality videos.

However, the accurate reconstruction of diverse details, including structure, background, texture, color, and more, remains challenging. The stable diffusion models inevitably result in the variability of reconstructed images, even under identical conditions. To address this challenge, we first uncover the neuroscientific perspective of diffusion methods, which primarily involve top-down creation using pre-trained knowledge from extensive image datasets, but tend to lack detail-driven bottom-up perception, leading to a loss of faithful details. In this paper, we propose NeuralDiffuser, which incorporates primary visual feature guidance to provide detailed cues in the form of gradients. This extension of the bottom-up process for diffusion models achieves both semantic coherence and detail fidelity when reconstructing visual stimuli. Furthermore, we have developed a novel guidance strategy for reconstruction tasks that ensures the consistency of repeated outputs with original images rather than with various outputs. Extensive experimental results on the Natural Senses Dataset (NSD) qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the advancement of NeuralDiffuser by comparing it against baseline and state-of-the-art methods horizontally, as well as conducting longitudinal ablation studies.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a relative scarcity of research on image-guided video editing, a method that empowers users to edit videos by merely indicating a target object in the initial frame and providing an RGB image as reference, without relying on the text prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel Image-guided Video Editing Diffusion model, termed IVEDiff for the image-guided video editing. IVEDiff is built on top of image editing models, and is equipped with learnable motion modules to maintain the temporal consistency of edited video. Inspired by self-supervised learning concepts, we introduce a masked motion modeling fine-tuning strategy that empowers the motion module's capabilities for capturing inter-frame motion dynamics, while preserving the capabilities for intra-frame semantic correlations modeling of the base image editing model. Moreover, an optical-flow-guided motion reference network is proposed to ensure the accurate propagation of information between edited video frames, alleviating the misleading effects of invalid information. We also construct a benchmark to facilitate further research. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method is able to generate temporally smooth edited videos while robustly dealing with various editing objects with high quality.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this issue, quantization of diffusion models has been explored. It reduces memory usage and computational costs by compressing weights and activations into lower-bit formats. However, existing methods often struggle to preserve both image quality and text-image alignment, particularly in lower-bit($<$ 8bits) quantization. In this paper, we analyze the challenges associated with quantizing text-to-image diffusion models from a distributional perspective. Our analysis reveals that activation outliers play a crucial role in determining image quality. Additionally, we identify distinctive patterns in cross-attention scores, which significantly affects text-image alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Distribution-aware Group Quantization (DGQ), a method that identifies and adaptively handles pixel-wise and channel-wise outliers to preserve image quality. Furthermore, DGQ applies prompt-specific logarithmic quantization scales to maintain text-image alignment. Our method demonstrates remarkable performance on datasets such as MS-COCO and PartiPrompts. We are the first to successfully achieve low-bit quantization of text-to-image diffusion models without requiring additional fine-tuning of weight quantization parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ugonfor.kr/DGQ</p></details> |

While recent video diffusion models have shown promising potential, they still grapple with spatiotemporal inconsistencies and high computational resource demands. We propose GLC-Diffusion, a tuning-free method for long video generation. It models the long video denoising process by establishing denoising trajectories through Global-Local Collaborative Denoising to ensure overall content consistency and temporal coherence between frames. Additionally, we introduce a Noise Reinitialization strategy which combines local noise shuffling with frequency fusion to improve global content consistency and visual diversity. Further, we propose a Video Motion Consistency Refinement (VMCR) module that computes the gradient of pixel-wise and frequency-wise losses to enhance visual consistency and temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments, including quantitative and qualitative evaluations on videos of varying lengths (\textit{e.g.}, 3\times and 6\times longer), demonstrate that our method effectively integrates with existing video diffusion models, producing coherent, high-fidelity long videos superior to previous approaches.</p></details> |  |

To achieve controllability, current studies focus on two main directions: (1) using reference speech as prosody prompt to guide speech synthesis, and (2) using natural language descriptions to control the generation process. However, finding reference speech that exactly contains the prosody that users want to synthesize takes a lot of effort. Description-based guidance in TTS systems can only determine the overall prosody, which has difficulty in achieving fine-grained prosody control over the synthesized speech. In this paper, we propose DrawSpeech, a sketch-conditioned diffusion model capable of generating speech based on any prosody sketches drawn by users. Specifically, the prosody sketches are fed to DrawSpeech to provide a rough indication of the expected prosody trends. DrawSpeech then recovers the detailed pitch and energy contours based on the coarse sketches and synthesizes the desired speech. Experimental results show that DrawSpeech can generate speech with a wide variety of prosody and can precisely control the fine-grained prosody in a user-friendly manner.

Although deep learning methods have demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in wire segmentation, they require substantial annotated datasets for generalizability, underscoring the need for extensive labeled data to enhance model performance. To address this challenge, we propose the Segmentation-guided Frame-consistency Video Diffusion Model (SF-VD) to generate large collections of labeled fluoroscopy videos, augmenting the training data for wire segmentation networks. SF-VD leverages videos with limited annotations by independently modeling scene distribution and motion distribution. It first samples the scene distribution by generating 2D fluoroscopy images with wires positioned according to a specified input mask, and then samples the motion distribution by progressively generating subsequent frames, ensuring frame-to-frame coherence through a frame-consistency strategy. A segmentation-guided mechanism further refines the process by adjusting wire contrast, ensuring a diverse range of visibility in the synthesized image. Evaluation on a fluoroscopy dataset confirms the superior quality of the generated videos and shows significant improvements in guidewire segmentation.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

To tackle this challenge, we introduce Anomaly Segmentation with Forward Process of Diffusion Models (AnoFPDM), a fully weakly-supervised framework that operates without the need of pixel-level labels. Leveraging the unguided forward process as a reference for the guided forward process, we select hyperparameters such as the noise scale, the threshold for segmentation and the guidance strength.

However, as the text to nature image models, we show that the T2MedI model can also bias to some subgroups to overlook the minority ones in the training set. In this work, we first build a T2MedI model based on the pre-trained Imagen model, which has the fixed contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) text encoder, while its decoder has been fine-tuned on medical images from the Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset. Its gender bias is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Toward this issue, we propose to fine-tune the T2MedI toward the target application dataset to align their sensitive subgroups distribution probability. Specifically, the alignment loss for fine-tuning is guided by an off-the-shelf sensitivity-subgroup classifier to match the classification probability between the generated images and the expected target dataset. In addition, the image quality is maintained by a CLIP-consistency regularization term following a knowledge distillation scheme. For evaluation, we set the target dataset to be enhanced as the BraST18 dataset, and trained a brain magnetic resonance (MR) slice-based gender classifier from it. With our method, the generated MR image can markedly reduce the inconsistency with the gender proportion in the BraTS18 dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving optimal performance requires access to extensive healthcare data, which is often not readily available. Furthermore, the imperative to preserve patient privacy restricts patient data sharing with third parties and even within institutes. Recently, generative AI models have been gaining traction for facilitating open-data sharing by proposing synthetic data as surrogates of real patient data. Despite the promise, some of these models are susceptible to patient data memorization, where models generate patient data copies instead of novel synthetic samples. Considering the importance of the problem, surprisingly it has received relatively little attention in the medical imaging community. To this end, we assess memorization in unconditional latent diffusion models. We train latent diffusion models on CT, MR, and X-ray datasets for synthetic data generation. We then detect the amount of training data memorized utilizing our novel self-supervised copy detection approach and further investigate various factors that can influence memorization. Our findings show a surprisingly high degree of patient data memorization across all datasets. Comparison with non-diffusion generative models, such as autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, indicates that while latent diffusion models are more susceptible to memorization, overall they outperform non-diffusion models in synthesis quality. Further analyses reveal that using augmentation strategies, small architecture, and increasing dataset can reduce memorization while over-training the models can enhance it. Collectively, our results emphasize the importance of carefully training generative models on private medical imaging datasets, and examining the synthetic data to ensure patient privacy before sharing it for medical research and applications.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in vision-language and diffusion models have fueled interest in text-to-vector graphics generation. However, existing approaches often suffer from over-parameterized outputs or treat the layered structure - a core feature of vector graphics - as a secondary goal, diminishing their practical use. Recognizing the importance of layered SVG representations, we propose NeuralSVG, an implicit neural representation for generating vector graphics from text prompts. Inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), NeuralSVG encodes the entire scene into the weights of a small MLP network, optimized using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To encourage a layered structure in the generated SVG, we introduce a dropout-based regularization technique that strengthens the standalone meaning of each shape. We additionally demonstrate that utilizing a neural representation provides an added benefit of inference-time control, enabling users to dynamically adapt the generated SVG based on user-provided inputs, all with a single learned representation.

Critically, we prove that a very specific memoryless noise schedule must be enforced during fine-tuning, in order to account for the dependency between the noise variable and the generated samples. We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression problem.

While recent advances in video diffusion models have shown impressive capabilities in text-to-video generation, maintaining consistent identity while producing natural motion remains challenging. Previous methods either require person-specific fine-tuning or struggle to balance identity preservation with motion diversity. Built upon Video Diffusion Transformers, our method introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch facial feature extractor that captures both identity and structural features, (2) a lightweight cross-modal adapter with Conditioned Adaptive Normalization for efficient identity integration, and (3) a two-stage training strategy combining synthetic identity pairs with video data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magic Mirror effectively balances identity consistency with natural motion, outperforming existing methods across multiple metrics while requiring minimal parameters added.

Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such challenges in diffusion models by developing an influence functions framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by this, we introduce a novel task: Gaze-Guided Hand-Object Interaction Synthesis, with potential applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and assistive technologies. To support this task, we present GazeHOI, the first dataset to capture simultaneous 3D modeling of gaze, hand, and object interactions. This task poses significant challenges due to the inherent sparsity and noise in gaze data, as well as the need for high consistency and physical plausibility in generating hand and object motions. To tackle these issues, we propose a stacked gaze-guided hand-object interaction diffusion model, named GHO-Diffusion. The stacked design effectively reduces the complexity of motion generation. We also introduce HOI-Manifold Guidance during the sampling stage of GHO-Diffusion, enabling fine-grained control over generated motions while maintaining the data manifold. Additionally, we propose a spatial-temporal gaze feature encoding for the diffusion condition and select diffusion results based on consistency scores between gaze-contact maps and gaze-interaction trajectories. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of our method and the unique contributions of our dataset.

In contrast, humans are difficult to be cheated by subtle manipulations, since we make judgments only based on essential factors. Inspired by this observation, we attempt to model label generation with essential label-causative factors and incorporate label-non-causative factors to assist data generation. For an adversarial example, we aim to discriminate the perturbations as non-causative factors and make predictions only based on the label-causative factors. Concretely, we propose a casual diffusion model (CausalDiff) that adapts diffusion models for conditional data generation and disentangles the two types of casual factors by learning towards a novel casual information bottleneck objective. Empirically, CausalDiff has significantly outperformed state-of-the-art defense methods on various unseen attacks, achieving an average robustness of 86.39% (+4.01%) on CIFAR-10, 56.25% (+3.13%) on CIFAR-100, and 82.62% (+4.93%) on GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark).

However, segmentation is challenging due to the significant class imbalance between healthy and pathological tissues. This paper addresses this issue by leveraging a diffusion model for data augmentation applied during training an AI model. Our approach generates synthetic pathological tissue patches while preserving essential shape characteristics and intricate details specific to each tissue type. This method enhances the segmentation process by increasing the occurence of underrepresented classes in the training data. We demonstrate that our diffusion-based augmentation technique improves segmentation accuracy across all pathological tissue types, particularly for the less common patterns.

To tackle the increasing complexity of these forgeries, we propose \textbf{Wavelet-CLIP}, a deepfake detection framework that integrates wavelet transforms with features derived from the ViT-L/14 architecture, pre-trained in the CLIP fashion. Wavelet-CLIP utilizes Wavelet Transforms to deeply analyze both spatial and frequency features from images, thus enhancing the model's capability to detect sophisticated deepfakes. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive evaluations against existing state-of-the-art methods for cross-dataset generalization and detection of unseen images generated by standard diffusion models.

Diffusion models have emerged as SOTA approaches in data generation across various modalities. For molecular graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) as a diffusion backbone have achieved impressive results. Latent space diffusion, where diffusion occurs in a low-dimensional space via an autoencoder, has demonstrated computational efficiency. However, the literature on latent space diffusion for molecular graphs is scarce, and no commonly accepted best practices exist. In this work, we explore different approaches and hyperparameters, contrasting generative flow models (denoising diffusion, flow matching, heat dissipation) and architectures (GNNs and E(3)-equivariant GNNs). Our experiments reveal a high sensitivity to the choice of approach and design decisions.

In this paper, we propose a novel method based on dual diffusion bridges, trained using the CocoChorales Dataset, which consists of unpaired monophonic single-instrument audio data. Each diffusion model is trained on a specific instrument with a Gaussian prior. During inference, a model is designated as the source model to map the input audio to its corresponding Gaussian prior, and another model is designated as the target model to reconstruct the target audio from this Gaussian prior, thereby facilitating timbre transfer. We compare our approach against existing unsupervised timbre transfer models such as VAEGAN and Gaussian Flow Bridges (GFB). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both better Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) and melody preservation, as reflected by lower pitch distances (DPD) compared to VAEGAN and GFB. Additionally, we discover that the noise level from the Gaussian prior, $\sigma$, can be adjusted to control the degree of melody preservation and amount of timbre transferred.</p></details> |  |

During manufacturing, variations in material and process parameters can significantly influence the exact fiber orientation. We employ multilevel polynomial surrogates to model the propagation of uncertain material properties in the injection molding process. To ensure reliable uncertainty quantification, a key focus is deriving novel error bounds for statistical measures of a quantity of interest, computed via these surrogates. To verify these bounds, we conduct numerical experiments using the Cross-WLF viscosity model alongside the Hagen-Poiseuille flow in a rectangular channel. In particular, the impact of uncertainties in fiber length and matrix temperature on the fractional anisotropy of fiber orientation is investigated. The Folgar-Tucker equation and the improved anisotropic rotary diffusion model are used, incorporating recently established analytical solutions of these models as part of our verification. Our results demonstrate that the investigated method significantly improves upon standard Monte Carlo estimation, while also providing error guarantees. These findings offer the first step toward a reliable and practical tool for optimizing fiber-reinforced polymer manufacturing processes in the future.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the input format for the inpainting task proposed by FLUX.1-Fill-dev, we improve the Long-context Condition Unit (LCU) introduced in ACE and extend this input paradigm to any editing and generation tasks. To take full advantage of image generative priors, we develop a two-stage training scheme to minimize the efforts of finetuning powerful text-to-image diffusion models like FLUX.1-dev. In the first stage, we pre-train the model using task data with the 0-ref tasks from the text-to-image model. There are many models in the community based on the post-training of text-to-image foundational models that meet this training paradigm of the first stage. For example, FLUX.1-Fill-dev deals primarily with painting tasks and can be used as an initialization to accelerate the training process. In the second stage, we finetune the above model to support the general instructions using all tasks defined in ACE. To promote the widespread application of ACE++ in different scenarios, we provide a comprehensive set of models that cover both full finetuning and lightweight finetuning, while considering general applicability and applicability in vertical scenarios. The qualitative analysis showcases the superiority of ACE++ in terms of generating image quality and prompt following ability.

Various techniques, such as MultiDiffusion and SyncDiffusion, have further pushed image generation beyond training resolutions, i.e., from square images to panorama, by merging multiple overlapping diffusion paths or employing gradient descent to maintain perceptual coherence. However, these methods suffer from significant computational inefficiencies due to generating and averaging numerous predictions, which is required in practice to produce high-quality and seamless images. This work addresses this limitation and presents a novel approach that eliminates the need to generate and average numerous overlapping denoising predictions. Our method shifts non-overlapping denoising windows over time, ensuring that seams in one timestep are corrected in the next. This results in coherent, high-resolution images with fewer overall steps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, comparing it with MultiDiffusion, SyncDiffusion, and StitchDiffusion. Our method offers several key benefits, including improved computational efficiency and faster inference times while producing comparable or better image quality.

Meanwhile, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated substantial improvements in optimizing Wi-Fi network performance. Wi-Fi optimization problems are highly challenging to model mathematically, and DRL methods can bypass complex mathematical modeling, while GDMs excel in handling complex data modeling. Therefore, combining DRL with GDMs can mutually enhance their capabilities. The current MAC layer access mechanism in Wi-Fi networks is the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), which dramatically decreases in performance with a high number of terminals. In this study, we propose the Deep Diffusion Deterministic Policy Gradient (D3PG) algorithm, which integrates diffusion models with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) framework to optimize Wi-Fi network performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply such an integration in Wi-Fi performance optimization. We propose an access mechanism that jointly adjusts the contention window and the aggregation frame length based on the D3PG algorithm. Through simulations, we have demonstrated that this mechanism significantly outperforms existing Wi-Fi standards in dense Wi-Fi scenarios, maintaining performance even as the number of users increases sharply.</p></details> |  |

However, missing modalities are commonly observed due to limitations in scan time, scan corruption, artifacts, motion, and contrast agent intolerance. Synthesis of missing MRI has been a means to address the limitations of modality insufficiency in clinical practice and research. However, there are still some challenges, such as poor generalization, inaccurate non-linear mapping, and slow processing speeds. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel unified synthesis model, the Frequency-guided and Coarse-to-fine Unified Diffusion Model (FgC2F-UDiff), designed for multiple inputs and outputs. Specifically, the Coarse-to-fine Unified Network (CUN) fully exploits the iterative denoising properties of diffusion models, from global to detail, by dividing the denoising process into two stages, coarse and fine, to enhance the fidelity of synthesized images. Secondly, the Frequency-guided Collaborative Strategy (FCS) harnesses appropriate frequency information as prior knowledge to guide the learning of a unified, highly non-linear mapping. Thirdly, the Specific-acceleration Hybrid Mechanism (SHM) integrates specific mechanisms to accelerate the diffusion model and enhance the feasibility of many-to-many synthesis. Extensive experimental evaluations have demonstrated that our proposed FgC2F-UDiff model achieves superior performance on two datasets, validated through a comprehensive assessment that includes both qualitative observations and quantitative metrics, such as PSNR SSIM, LPIPS, and FID.</p></details> |  |
| **[SceneBooth: Diffusion-based Framework for Subject-preserved Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03490v1)** | 2025-01-07 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.03490v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the demand for personalizing image generation, subject-driven text-to-image generation method, which creates novel renditions of an input subject based on text prompts, has received growing research interest. Existing methods often learn subject representation and incorporate it into the prompt embedding to guide image generation, but they struggle with preserving subject fidelity. To solve this issue, this paper approaches a novel framework named SceneBooth for subject-preserved text-to-image generation, which consumes inputs of a subject image, object phrases and text prompts. Instead of learning the subject representation and generating a subject, our SceneBooth fixes the given subject image and generates its background image guided by the text prompts. To this end, our SceneBooth introduces two key components, i.e., a multimodal layout generation module and a background painting module. The former determines the position and scale of the subject by generating appropriate scene layouts that align with text captions, object phrases, and subject visual information. The latter integrates two adapters (ControlNet and Gated Self-Attention) into the latent diffusion model to generate a background that harmonizes with the subject guided by scene layouts and text descriptions. In this manner, our SceneBooth ensures accurate preservation of the subject's appearance in the output. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that SceneBooth significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of subject preservation, image harmonization and overall quality.</p></details> |  |

Different from generating text on artificially designed images (such as posters, covers, cartoons, etc.), the text in natural scene images needs to meet the following four key criteria: (1) Fidelity: the generated text should appear as realistic as a photograph and be completely accurate, with no errors in any of the strokes. (2) Reasonability: the text should be generated on reasonable carrier areas (such as boards, signs, walls, etc.), and the generated text content should also be relevant to the scene. (3) Utility: the generated text can facilitate to the training of natural scene OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tasks. (4) Controllability: The attribute of the text (such as font and color) should be controllable as needed. In this paper, we propose a two stage method, SceneVTG++, which simultaneously satisfies the four aspects mentioned above. SceneVTG++ consists of a Text Layout and Content Generator (TLCG) and a Controllable Local Text Diffusion (CLTD). The former utilizes the world knowledge of multi modal large language models to find reasonable text areas and recommend text content according to the nature scene background images, while the latter generates controllable multilingual text based on the diffusion model. Through extensive experiments, we respectively verified the effectiveness of TLCG and CLTD, and demonstrated the state-of-the-art text generation performance of SceneVTG++. In addition, the generated images have superior utility in OCR tasks like text detection and text recognition. Codes and datasets will be available.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

To address this challenge, synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach. In this paper, we propose to synthesize realistic license plates (LPs) using diffusion models, inspired by recent advances in image and video generation. In our experiments a diffusion model was successfully trained on a Ukrainian LP dataset, and 1000 synthetic images were generated for detailed analysis. Through manual classification and annotation of the generated images, we performed a thorough study of the model output, such as success rate, character distributions, and type of failures. Our contributions include experimental validation of the efficacy of diffusion models for LP synthesis, along with insights into the characteristics of the generated data. Furthermore, we have prepared a synthetic dataset consisting of 10,000 LP images, publicly available at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13342102. Conducted experiments empirically confirm the usefulness of synthetic data for the LPR task. Despite the initial performance gap between the model trained with real and synthetic data, the expansion of the training data set with pseudolabeled synthetic data leads to an improvement in LPR accuracy by 3% compared to baseline.</p></details> |  |

Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to provide responsive and adaptable services. However, existing methods primarily focus on either vehicle scheduling or path planning, which often simplify complex urban layouts and neglect the necessity for simultaneous coordination and mutual avoidance among CAVs. This oversimplification poses significant challenges to the deployment of AMoD systems in real-world scenarios. To address these gaps, we propose CoDriveVLM, a novel framework that integrates high-fidelity simultaneous dispatching and cooperative motion planning for future AMoD systems. Our method harnesses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance multi-modality information processing, and this enables comprehensive dispatching and collision risk evaluation. The VLM-enhanced CAV dispatching coordinator is introduced to effectively manage complex and unforeseen AMoD conditions, thus supporting efficient scheduling decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a scalable decentralized cooperative motion planning method via consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) focusing on collision risk evaluation and decentralized trajectory optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of CoDriveVLM in various traffic conditions, showcasing its potential to significantly improve the fidelity and effectiveness of AMoD systems in future urban transportation networks.

Despite their rapid advancements in research and growing popularity in applications, a comprehensive survey of existing studies on VLMs is notably lacking, particularly for researchers aiming to leverage VLMs in their specific domains. To this end, we provide a systematic overview of VLMs in the following aspects: model information of the major VLMs developed over the past five years (2019-2024); the main architectures and training methods of these VLMs; summary and categorization of the popular benchmarks and evaluation metrics of VLMs; the applications of VLMs including embodied agents, robotics, and video generation; the challenges and issues faced by current VLMs such as hallucination, fairness, and safety.

We introduce three key improvements that contribute to SAIL-VL's leading performance: (1) Scalable high-quality visual understanding data construction: We implement a visual understanding data construction pipeline, which enables hundred-million-scale high-quality recaption data annotation. Equipped with this pipeline, we curate SAIL-Caption, a large-scale caption dataset with large quantity and the highest data quality compared with opensource caption datasets. (2) Scalable Pretraining with High-Quality Visual Understanding Data: We scale SAIL-VL's pretraining budget up to 131B tokens and show that even a 2B VLM benefits from scaled up training data sizes, exhibiting expected data size scaling laws in visual understanding and instruction following performance. (3) Scalable SFT via quantity and quality scaling: We introduce general guidance for instruction data curation to scale up instruction data continuously, allowing us to construct a large SFT dataset with the highest quality. To further improve SAIL-VL's performance, we propose quality scaling, a multi-stage training recipe with curriculum learning, to improve model performance scaling curves w.r.t. data sizes from logarithmic to be near-linear. SAIL-VL obtains the highest average score in 19 commonly used benchmarks in our evaluation and achieves top1 performance among VLMs of comparable sizes on OpenCompass (https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal). We release our SAIL-VL-2B model at HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/BytedanceDouyinContent/SAIL-VL-2B).</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interactively generate and edit BTs that address visual conditions, enabling context-aware robot operations in visually complex environments. A key feature of our approach lies in the conditional control through self-prompted visual conditions. Specifically, the VLM generates BTs with visual condition nodes, where conditions are expressed as free-form text. Another VLM process integrates the text into its prompt and evaluates the conditions against real-world images during robot execution. We validated our framework in a real-world cafe scenario, demonstrating both its feasibility and limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

Existing datasets and tasks, however, have notable limitations. Most datasets are confined to short videos with limited events and narrow narratives. For example, datasets with instructional and egocentric videos often depict activities of one person in a single scene. Although existing movie datasets offer richer content, they are often limited to short-term tasks, lack publicly available videos, and frequently encounter data leakage issues given the use of subtitles and other information about commercial movies during LLM pretraining. To address the above limitations, we propose Short-Films 20K (SF20K), the largest publicly available movie dataset. SF20K is composed of 20,143 amateur films and offers long-term video tasks in the form of multiple-choice and open-ended question answering. Our extensive analysis of SF20K reveals minimal data leakage, emphasizes the need for long-term reasoning, and demonstrates the strong performance of recent VLMs. Finally, we show that instruction tuning on the SF20K-Train set substantially improves model performance, paving the way for future progress in long-term video understanding.</p></details> |  |

For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been effective in zero-shot tasks by leveraging their general knowledge from large-scale datasets. Recent studies demonstrate that transformer-based models with class-wise queries can effectively address zero-shot multi-label classification. However, poor utilization of the relationship between seen and unseen attributes makes the model lack generalizability. Additionally, attribute classification generally involves many attributes, making maintaining the model's scalability difficult. To address these issues, we propose Super-class guided transFormer (SugaFormer), a novel framework that leverages super-classes to enhance scalability and generalizability for zero-shot attribute classification. SugaFormer employs Super-class Query Initialization (SQI) to reduce the number of queries, utilizing common semantic information from super-classes, and incorporates Multi-context Decoding (MD) to handle diverse visual cues. To strengthen generalizability, we introduce two knowledge transfer strategies that utilize VLMs. During training, Super-class guided Consistency Regularization (SCR) aligns SugaFormer's features with VLMs using region-specific prompts, and during inference, Zero-shot Retrieval-based Score Enhancement (ZRSE) refines predictions for unseen attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SugaFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across three widely-used attribute classification benchmarks under zero-shot, and cross-dataset transfer settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/SugaFormer.</p></details> | AAAI25 |

This limitation is particularly evident in ADL tasks, where understanding detailed human-object interaction and human-centric motion is crucial for applications such as elderly monitoring and cognitive assessment. To address this, we aim to leverage the complementary nature of egocentric views to enhance LVLM's understanding of exocentric ADL videos. Consequently, we propose an online ego2exo distillation approach to learn ego-augmented exo representations in LVLMs. While effective, this approach requires paired ego-exo training data, which is impractical to collect for real-world ADL scenarios. Consequently, we develop EgoMimic, a skeleton-guided method that can generate mimicked ego views from exocentric videos. We find that the exo representations of our ego-augmented LVLMs successfully learn to extract ego-perspective cues, demonstrated through comprehensive evaluation on six ADL benchmarks and our proposed EgoPerceptionMCQ benchmark designed specifically to assess egocentric understanding from exocentric videos. Code, models, and data will be open-sourced at https://github.com/dominickrei/EgoExo4ADL.</p></details> |  |

This study developed a dynamic scene retrieval system using Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models, which can be optimized for real-time deployment on edge devices. The proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art in-context learning methods, including the zero-shot capabilities of GPT-4o, particularly in complex scenarios. By conducting frame-level analysis on the Honda Scenes Dataset, which contains a collection of about 80 hours of annotated driving videos capturing diverse real-world road and weather conditions, our study highlights the robustness of CLIP models in learning visual concepts from natural language supervision. Results also showed that fine-tuning the CLIP models, such as ViT-L/14 and ViT-B/32, significantly improved scene classification, achieving a top F1 score of 91.1%. These results demonstrate the ability of the system to deliver rapid and precise scene recognition, which can be used to meet the critical requirements of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). This study shows the potential of CLIP models to provide scalable and efficient frameworks for dynamic scene understanding and classification. Furthermore, this work lays the groundwork for advanced autonomous vehicle technologies by fostering a deeper understanding of driver behavior, road conditions, and safety-critical scenarios, marking a significant step toward smarter, safer, and more context-aware autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

Many existing approaches directly utilize visual or textual features as class prototypes, however, these features fail to adequately represent their respective classes. We identify that this limitation arises from the modality gap inherent in pretrained vision-language models, which weakens the connection between the visual and textual modalities. To eliminate this modality gap and enable textual features to fully represent class prototypes, we propose a simple and efficient Cross-Modal Mapping (CMM) method. This method employs a linear transformation to map image features into the textual feature space, ensuring that both modalities are comparable within the same feature space. Nevertheless, the modality gap diminishes the effectiveness of this mapping. To address this, we further introduce a triplet loss to optimize the spatial relationships between image features and class textual features, allowing class textual features to naturally serve as class prototypes for image features. Experimental results on 11 benchmark demonstrate an average improvement of approximately 3.5% compared to conventional methods and exhibit competitive performance on 4 distribution shift benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has focused on mitigating these attacks in object recognition models through weight fine-tuning, much less attention has been given to detecting backdoored samples directly. Given the vast datasets used in training, manual inspection for backdoor triggers is impractical, and even state-of-the-art defense mechanisms fail to fully neutralize their impact. To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Experiments demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of this method, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 86% across two renowned datasets for detecting unseen backdoor triggers, establishing a new standard in backdoor defense.</p></details> |  |

Despite this progress, these models often encounter substantial domain gaps, hindering their ability to engage in complex conversations across new domains. Recent efforts have aimed to mitigate this issue, albeit relying on domain-specific image-text data to curate instruction-tuning data. However, many domains, such as agriculture, lack such vision-language data. In this work, we propose an approach to construct instruction-tuning data that harnesses vision-only data for the agriculture domain. We utilize diverse agricultural datasets spanning multiple domains, curate class-specific information, and employ large language models (LLMs) to construct an expert-tuning set, resulting in a 70k expert-tuning dataset called AgroInstruct. Subsequently, we expert-tuned and created AgroGPT, an efficient LMM that can hold complex agriculture-related conversations and provide useful insights. We also develop AgroEvals for evaluation and compare {AgroGPT's} performance with large open and closed-source models. {AgroGPT} excels at identifying fine-grained agricultural concepts, can act as an agriculture expert, and provides helpful information for multimodal agriculture questions.

Such data is almost always curated from in-the-wild videos, given the cross-modal semantic correspondence that is inherent to them. In this work, we hypothesize that insisting on the absolute need for ground truth audio-visual correspondence, is not only unnecessary, but also leads to severe restrictions in scale, quality, and diversity of the data, ultimately impairing its use in the modern generative models. That is, we propose a scalable image sonification framework where instances from a variety of high-quality yet disjoint uni-modal origins can be artificially paired through a retrieval process that is empowered by reasoning capabilities of modern vision-language models. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we use our sonified images to train an audio-to-image generative model that performs competitively against state-of-the-art. Finally, through a series of ablation studies, we exhibit several intriguing auditory capabilities like semantic mixing and interpolation, loudness calibration and acoustic space modeling through reverberation that our model has implicitly developed to guide the image generation process.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance in 3D spatial comprehension, which is critical for embodied intelligence, remains limited. Recent advances have leveraged 3D point clouds and multi-view images as inputs, yielding promising results. However, we propose exploring a purely vision-based solution inspired by human perception, which merely relies on visual cues for 3D spatial understanding. This paper empirically investigates the limitations of VLMs in 3D spatial knowledge, revealing that their primary shortcoming lies in the lack of global-local correspondence between the scene and individual frames. To address this, we introduce GPT4Scene, a novel visual prompting paradigm in VLM training and inference that helps build the global-local relationship, significantly improving the 3D spatial understanding of indoor scenes. Specifically, GPT4Scene constructs a 3D Bird's Eye View (BEV) image from the video and marks consistent object IDs across both frames and the BEV image. The model then inputs the concatenated BEV image and video frames with markers. In zero-shot evaluations, GPT4Scene improves performance over closed-source VLMs like GPT-4o. Additionally, we prepare a processed video dataset consisting of 165K text annotation to fine-tune open-source VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all 3D understanding tasks. Surprisingly, after training with the GPT4Scene paradigm, VLMs consistently improve during inference, even without visual prompting and BEV image as explicit correspondence. It demonstrates that the proposed paradigm helps VLMs develop an intrinsic ability to understand 3D scenes, which paves the way for a noninvasive approach to extending pre-trained VLMs for 3D scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gpt4scene.github.io/</p></details> |

However, prior research works have predominantly focused on enhancing Far-OOD performance, while potentially compromising Near-OOD efficacy, as observed from our pilot study. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy to enhance zero-shot OOD detection performances for both Far-OOD and Near-OOD scenarios by innovatively harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) and VLMs. Our approach first exploit an LLM to generate superclasses of the ID labels and their corresponding background descriptions followed by feature extraction using CLIP. We then isolate the core semantic features for ID data by subtracting background features from the superclass features. The refined representation facilitates the selection of more appropriate negative labels for OOD data from a comprehensive candidate label set of WordNet, thereby enhancing the performance of zero-shot OOD detection in both scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce novel few-shot prompt tuning and visual prompt tuning to adapt the proposed framework to better align with the target distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, with an improvement of up to 2.9% in AUROC and a reduction of up to 12.6% in FPR95. Additionally, our method exhibits superior robustness against covariate shift across different domains, further highlighting its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Existing efforts mitigate these issues by adding multilingual training data, but do so in a largely ad-hoc manner, lacking insight into how different training mixes tip the scale for different groups of languages. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the training strategies for massively multilingual LVLMs. First, we conduct a series of multi-stage experiments spanning 13 downstream vision-language tasks and 43 languages, systematically examining: (1) the number of training languages that can be included without degrading English performance and (2) optimal language distributions of pre-training as well as (3) instruction-tuning data. Further, we (4) investigate how to improve multilingual text-in-image understanding, and introduce a new benchmark for the task. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that one can (i) include as many as 100 training languages simultaneously (ii) with as little as 25-50\% of non-English data, to greatly improve multilingual performance while retaining strong English performance. We further find that (iii) including non-English OCR data in pre-training and instruction-tuning is paramount for improving multilingual text-in-image understanding. Finally, we put all our findings together and train Centurio, a 100-language LVLM, offering state-of-the-art performance in an evaluation covering 14 tasks and 56 languages.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 7.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs based on egocentric videos are of great interest. However, current datasets for embodied video question answering lack comprehensive and systematic evaluation frameworks. Critical embodied cognitive issues, such as robotic self-cognition, dynamic scene perception, and hallucination, are rarely addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and varied question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure quality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent meticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies. Additionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that ensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we conduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific LVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of LVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied agents.

Language interfaces, particularly those powered by Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision Language Models (VLM), hold significant promise in this context, as they can interpret visual scenes and correlate them with semantic information. However, such interfaces are also known for their hallucinated predictions. In addition, language instructions provided by humans can also be ambiguous and lack precise details about specific locations, objects, or actions, exacerbating the hallucination issue. In this work, we introduce Seeing with Partial Certainty (SwPC) - a framework designed to measure and align uncertainty in VLM-based place recognition, enabling the model to recognize when it lacks confidence and seek assistance when necessary. This framework is built on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on place recognition while minimizing requests for human help in complex indoor environment settings. Through experiments on the widely used richly-annotated scene dataset Matterport3D, we show that SwPC significantly increases the success rate and decreases the amount of human intervention required relative to the prior art. SwPC can be utilized with any VLMs directly without requiring model fine-tuning, offering a promising, lightweight approach to uncertainty modeling that complements and scales alongside the expanding capabilities of foundational models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 Figures |

An accident can appear in a wide variety of forms, and understanding what type of accident is taking place may be useful to prevent it from recurring. This work focuses on classifying traffic scenes into specific accident types. We approach the problem by representing a traffic scene as a graph, where objects such as cars can be represented as nodes, and relative distances and directions between them as edges. This representation of a traffic scene is referred to as a scene graph, and can be used as input for an accident classifier. Better results are obtained with a classifier that fuses the scene graph input with visual and textual representations. This work introduces a multi-stage, multimodal pipeline that pre-processes videos of traffic accidents, encodes them as scene graphs, and aligns this representation with vision and language modalities before executing the classification task.

Our GLOV meta-prompts an LLM with the downstream task description, querying it for suitable VLM prompts (e.g., for zero-shot classification with CLIP). These prompts are ranked according to a purity measure obtained through a fitness function. In each respective optimization step, the ranked prompts are fed as in-context examples (with their accuracies) to equip the LLM with the knowledge of the type of text prompts preferred by the downstream VLM. Furthermore, we also explicitly steer the LLM generation process in each optimization step by specifically adding an offset difference vector of the embeddings from the positive and negative solutions found by the LLM, in previous optimization steps, to the intermediate layer of the network for the next generation step. This offset vector steers the LLM generation toward the type of language preferred by the downstream VLM, resulting in enhanced performance on the downstream vision tasks. We comprehensively evaluate our GLOV on 16 diverse datasets using two families of VLMs, i.e., dual-encoder (e.g., CLIP) and encoder-decoder (e.g., LLaVa) models -- showing that the discovered solutions can enhance the recognition performance by up to 15.0% and 57.5% (3.8% and 21.6% on average) for these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/jmiemirza/GLOV</p></details> |

However, multi-modal RAG systems face unique challenges: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant entries to user query (e.g., images, documents), and (ii) vision-language models or multi-modal language models like GPT-4o may hallucinate when processing these entries to generate RAG output. In this paper, we aim to address the first challenge, i.e, improving the selection of relevant context from the knowledge-base in retrieval phase of the multi-modal RAG. Specifically, we leverage the relevancy score (RS) measure designed in our previous work for evaluating the RAG performance to select more relevant entries in retrieval process. The retrieval based on embeddings, say CLIP-based embedding, and cosine similarity usually perform poorly particularly for multi-modal data. We show that by using a more advanced relevancy measure, one can enhance the retrieval process by selecting more relevant pieces from the knowledge-base and eliminate the irrelevant pieces from the context by adaptively selecting up-to-$k$ entries instead of fixed number of entries. Our evaluation using COCO dataset demonstrates significant enhancement in selecting relevant context and accuracy of the generated response.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the fine-tuning of DEPLOT, a modality conversion module that translates the image of a plot or chart to a linearized table, on a custom dataset of 50,000 bar charts. The dataset comprises simple, stacked, and grouped bar charts, targeting the unique structural features of these visualizations. The finetuned DEPLOT model is evaluated against its base version using a test set of 1,000 images and two metrics: Relative Mapping Similarity (RMS), which measures categorical mapping accuracy, and Relative Number Set Similarity (RNSS), which evaluates numerical interpretation accuracy. To further explore the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we curate an additional set of 100 bar chart images paired with question answer sets. Our findings demonstrate that providing a structured intermediate table alongside the image significantly enhances LLM reasoning performance compared to direct image queries.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the modality gap between textual and visual data, they often face significant challenges, such as over-reliance on text priors, hallucinations, and limited capacity for complex visual reasoning. Existing benchmarks to evaluate visual reasoning in LVLMs often rely on schematic or synthetic images and on imprecise machine-generated explanations. To bridge the modality gap, we present DrivingVQA, a new benchmark derived from driving theory tests to evaluate visual chain-of-thought reasoning in complex real-world scenarios. It offers 3,931 expert-crafted multiple-choice problems and interleaved explanations grounded with entities relevant to the reasoning process. We leverage this dataset to perform an extensive study of LVLMs' ability to reason about complex visual scenarios. Our experiments reveal that open-source and proprietary LVLMs struggle with visual chain-of-thought reasoning under zero-shot settings. We investigate training strategies that leverage relevant entities to improve visual reasoning. Notably, we observe a performance boost of up to 7\% when reasoning over image tokens of cropped regions tied to these entities.</p></details> |  |

While their practical benefits are widely acknowledged, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the contrastive pre-training framework remains limited. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain the success of contrastive pre-training in downstream tasks, such as zero-shot classification, conditional diffusion models, and vision-language models. We introduce the concept of approximate sufficient statistics, a generalization of the classical sufficient statistics, and show that near-minimizers of the contrastive pre-training loss are approximately sufficient, making them adaptable to diverse downstream tasks. We further propose the Joint Generative Hierarchical Model for the joint distribution of images and text, showing that transformers can efficiently approximate relevant functions within this model via belief propagation. Building on this framework, we derive sample complexity guarantees for multi-modal learning based on contrastive pre-trained representations. Numerical simulations validate these theoretical findings, demonstrating the strong generalization performance of contrastively pre-trained transformers in various multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | 108 pages |

Curation of these image-text pairs is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce SVP (Supervision-free Visual Projection), a novel framework that enhances vision-language alignment without relying on curated data or preference annotation. SVP leverages self-captioning and a pre-trained grounding model as a feedback mechanism to elicit latent information in VLMs. We evaluate our approach across six key areas: captioning, referring, visual question answering, multitasking, hallucination control, and object recall. Results demonstrate significant improvements, including a 14% average improvement in captioning tasks, up to 12% increase in object recall, and substantial reduction in hallucination rates. Notably, a small VLM using SVP achieves hallucination reductions comparable to a model five times larger, while a VLM with initially poor referring capabilities more than doubles its performance, approaching parity with a model twice its size.</p></details> | Preprint |

Identifying the reasons behind a biased system is not straightforward, since in many occasions they are associated with hidden spurious correlations which are not easy to spot. Standard approaches rely on bias audits performed by analyzing model performance in pre-defined subgroups of data samples, usually characterized by common attributes like gender or ethnicity when it comes to people, or other specific attributes defining semantically coherent groups of images. However, it is not always possible to know a-priori the specific attributes defining the failure modes of visual recognition systems. Recent approaches propose to discover these groups by leveraging large vision language models, which enable the extraction of cross-modal embeddings and the generation of textual descriptions to characterize the subgroups where a certain model is underperforming. In this work, we argue that incorporating visual explanations (e.g. heatmaps generated via GradCAM or other approaches) can boost the performance of such bias discovery and mitigation frameworks. To this end, we introduce Visually Grounded Bias Discovery and Mitigation (ViG-Bias), a simple yet effective technique which can be integrated to a variety of existing frameworks to improve both, discovery and mitigation performance. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that incorporating visual explanations enhances existing techniques like DOMINO, FACTS and Bias-to-Text, across several challenging datasets, including CelebA, Waterbirds, and NICO++.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

This capability is essential in applications such as industrial inspection, where logical anomaly detection is critical for maintaining high-quality standards and minimizing costly recalls. Previous research in anomaly detection (AD) has relied on prior knowledge for designing algorithms, which often requires extensive manual annotations, significant computing power, and large amounts of data for training. Autoregressive, multimodal Vision Language Models (AVLMs) offer a promising alternative due to their exceptional performance in visual reasoning across various domains. Despite this, their application to logical AD remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate using AVLMs for logical AD and demonstrate that they are well-suited to the task. Combining AVLMs with format embedding and a logic reasoner, we achieve SOTA performance on public benchmarks, MVTec LOCO AD, with an AUROC of 86.0% and F1-max of 83.7%, along with explanations of anomalies.

Comics Understanding, a complex and multifaceted field, stands to greatly benefit from these advances. Comics, as a medium, combine rich visual and textual narratives, challenging AI models with tasks that span image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and deeper narrative comprehension through sequential panels. However, the unique structure of comics -- characterized by creative variations in style, reading order, and non-linear storytelling -- presents a set of challenges distinct from those in other visual-language domains. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of Comics Understanding from both dataset and task perspectives. Our contributions are fivefold: (1) We analyze the structure of the comics medium, detailing its distinctive compositional elements; (2) We survey the widely used datasets and tasks in comics research, emphasizing their role in advancing the field; (3) We introduce the Layer of Comics Understanding (LoCU) framework, a novel taxonomy that redefines vision-language tasks within comics and lays the foundation for future work; (4) We provide a detailed review and categorization of existing methods following the LoCU framework; (5) Finally, we highlight current research challenges and propose directions for future exploration, particularly in the context of vision-language models applied to comics. This survey is the first to propose a task-oriented framework for comics intelligence and aims to guide future research by addressing critical gaps in data availability and task definition.

Recent works have explored vision-language models (VLMs) as a promising alternative, using multi-view rendering and textual prompting to identify object parts. However, naively applying VLMs in this context introduces several drawbacks, such as the need for meticulous prompt engineering, and fails to leverage the 3D geometric structure of objects. To address these limitations, we propose COPS, a COmprehensive model for Parts Segmentation that blends the semantics extracted from visual concepts and 3D geometry to effectively identify object parts. COPS renders a point cloud from multiple viewpoints, extracts 2D features, projects them back to 3D, and uses a novel geometric-aware feature aggregation procedure to ensure spatial and semantic consistency. Finally, it clusters points into parts and labels them. We demonstrate that COPS is efficient, scalable, and achieves zero-shot state-of-the-art performance across five datasets, covering synthetic and real-world data, texture-less and coloured objects, as well as rigid and non-rigid shapes.

Unfortunately, existing methods rely on dataset-specific hyperparameters, significantly limiting their adaptability to unseen tasks. In response, we propose Online Gaussian Adaptation (OGA), a novel method that models the likelihoods of visual features using Gaussian distributions and incorporates zero-shot priors into an interpretable Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation framework with fixed hyper-parameters across all datasets. We demonstrate that OGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on most datasets and runs. Additionally, we show that combining OTTA with popular few-shot techniques (a practical yet overlooked setting in prior research) is highly beneficial. Furthermore, our experimental study reveals that common OTTA evaluation protocols, which average performance over at most three runs per dataset, are inadequate due to the substantial variability observed across runs for all OTTA methods. Therefore, we advocate for more rigorous evaluation practices, including increasing the number of runs and considering additional quantitative metrics, such as our proposed Expected Tail Accuracy (ETA), calculated as the average accuracy in the worst 10% of runs. We hope these contributions will encourage more rigorous and diverse evaluation practices in the OTTA community. Code is available at https://github.com/cfuchs2023/OGA .</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce VideoMindPalace, a new framework inspired by the "Mind Palace", which organizes critical video moments into a topologically structured semantic graph. VideoMindPalace organizes key information through (i) hand-object tracking and interaction, (ii) clustered activity zones representing specific areas of recurring activities, and (iii) environment layout mapping, allowing natural language parsing by LLMs to provide grounded insights on spatio-temporal and 3D context. In addition, we propose the Video MindPalace Benchmark (VMB), to assess human-like reasoning, including spatial localization, temporal reasoning, and layout-aware sequential understanding. Evaluated on VMB and established video QA datasets, including EgoSchema, NExT-QA, IntentQA, and the Active Memories Benchmark, VideoMindPalace demonstrates notable gains in spatio-temporal coherence and human-aligned reasoning, advancing long-form video analysis capabilities in VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Running VLMs on edge devices has become a challenge for their widespread application. There are several efficient VLM efforts, but they often sacrifice linguistic capabilities to enhance multimodal abilities, or require extensive training. To address this quandary,we introduce the innovative framework of Efficient Vision Language Models with Elastic Visual Experts (Eve). By strategically incorporating adaptable visual expertise at multiple stages of training, Eve strikes a balance between preserving linguistic abilities and augmenting multimodal capabilities. This balanced approach results in a versatile model with only 1.8B parameters that delivers significant improvements in both multimodal and linguistic tasks. Notably, in configurations below 3B parameters, Eve distinctly outperforms in language benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art results 68.87% in VLM Benchmarks. Additionally, its multimodal accuracy outstrips that of the larger 7B LLaVA-1.5 model.</p></details> |  |

However, many of these works lack effective exploration of prior knowledge, rendering them unable to effectively address the domain gap issue in the context of 3D FSCIL, thereby leading to catastrophic forgetting. The Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-Training (CLIP) model serves as a highly suitable backbone for addressing the challenges of 3D FSCIL due to its abundant shape-related prior knowledge. Unfortunately, its direct application to 3D FSCIL still faces the incompatibility between 3D data representation and the 2D features, primarily manifested as feature space misalignment and significant noise. To address the above challenges, we introduce the FILP-3D framework with two novel components: the Redundant Feature Eliminator (RFE) for feature space misalignment and the Spatial Noise Compensator (SNC) for significant noise. RFE aligns the feature spaces of input point clouds and their embeddings by performing a unique dimensionality reduction on the feature space of pre-trained models (PTMs), effectively eliminating redundant information without compromising semantic integrity. On the other hand, SNC is a graph-based 3D model designed to capture robust geometric information within point clouds, thereby augmenting the knowledge lost due to projection, particularly when processing real-world scanned data. Moreover, traditional accuracy metrics are proven to be biased due to the imbalance in existing 3D datasets. Therefore we propose 3D FSCIL benchmark FSCIL3D-XL and novel evaluation metrics that offer a more nuanced assessment of a 3D FSCIL model. Experimental results on both established and our proposed benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Policy code generation methods use executable code to connect high-level task descriptions and low-level action sequences, leveraging the generalization capabilities of large language models and atomic skill libraries. In this work, we propose Robotic Programmer (RoboPro), a robotic foundation model, enabling the capability of perceiving visual information and following free-form instructions to perform robotic manipulation with policy code in a zero-shot manner. To address low efficiency and high cost in collecting runtime code data for robotic tasks, we devise Video2Code to synthesize executable code from extensive videos in-the-wild with off-the-shelf vision-language model and code-domain large language model. Extensive experiments show that RoboPro achieves the state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on robotic manipulation in both simulators and real-world environments. Specifically, the zero-shot success rate of RoboPro on RLBench surpasses the state-of-the-art model GPT-4o by 11.6%, which is even comparable to a strong supervised training baseline. Furthermore, RoboPro is robust to variations on API formats and skill sets.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, many pre-training datasets are restricted by patient privacy concerns, potentially containing noise that can adversely affect downstream performance. Moreover, the growing reliance on multi-modal generation exacerbates this issue because of its susceptibility to adversarial attacks. To investigate how VLMs trained on adversarial noisy data perform on downstream medical tasks, we first craft noisy upstream datasets using multi-modal adversarial attacks. Through our comprehensive analysis, we unveil that moderate noise enhances model robustness and transferability, but increasing noise levels negatively impact downstream task performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose rectify adversarial noise (RAN) framework, a recipe designed to effectively defend adversarial attacks and rectify the influence of upstream noise during fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

We introduce MM-Gen, a scalable method that generates task-specific, high-quality synthetic text for candidate images by leveraging stronger models. MM-Gen employs a three-stage targeted process: partitioning data into subgroups, generating targeted text based on task descriptions, and filtering out redundant and outlier data. Fine-tuning VLMs with data generated by MM-Gen leads to significant performance gains, including 29% on spatial reasoning and 15% on diagram understanding for Llava-1.5 (7B).

Existing frameworks accelerate training by applying FP8 computation to linear layers while leaving optimizer states and activations in higher precision, which fails to fully optimize memory usage. This paper introduces COAT (Compressing Optimizer States and Activations for FP8 Training), a novel FP8 training framework designed to significantly reduce memory footprint when training large models. COAT addresses current limitations through two key innovations: (1) Dynamic Range Expansion, which aligns optimizer state distributions more closely with the FP8 representation range, thereby reducing quantization error, and (2) Mixed-Granularity Activation Quantization, which optimizes activation memory using a combination of per-tensor and per-group quantization strategies. Experiments demonstrate that COAT effectively reduces end-to-end training memory footprint by 1.54x compared to BF16 while achieving nearly lossless performance across various tasks, such as Large Language Model pretraining and fine-tuning and Vision Language Model training. COAT also achieves a 1.43x end-to-end training speedup compared to BF16, performing on par with or surpassing TransformerEngine's speedup. COAT enables efficient full-parameter training of large models on fewer GPUs, and facilitates doubling the batch size in distributed training settings, providing a practical solution for scaling large-scale model training.

However, the assumption that VLMs inherently provide visually grounded, reliable, and interpretable explanations for driving remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce DriveBench, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate VLM reliability across 17 settings (clean, corrupted, and text-only inputs), encompassing 19,200 frames, 20,498 question-answer pairs, three question types, four mainstream driving tasks, and a total of 12 popular VLMs. Our findings reveal that VLMs often generate plausible responses derived from general knowledge or textual cues rather than true visual grounding, especially under degraded or missing visual inputs. This behavior, concealed by dataset imbalances and insufficient evaluation metrics, poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios like autonomous driving. We further observe that VLMs struggle with multi-modal reasoning and display heightened sensitivity to input corruptions, leading to inconsistencies in performance. To address these challenges, we propose refined evaluation metrics that prioritize robust visual grounding and multi-modal understanding. Additionally, we highlight the potential of leveraging VLMs' awareness of corruptions to enhance their reliability, offering a roadmap for developing more trustworthy and interpretable decision-making systems in real-world autonomous driving contexts.

Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content.

However, RAG, particularly multi-modal RAG, can introduce new hallucination sources: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant pieces (e.g., documents, images) as raw context from the database, and (ii) retrieved images are processed into text-based context via vision-language models (VLMs) or directly used by multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o, which may hallucinate. To address this, we propose a novel framework to evaluate the reliability of multi-modal RAG using two performance measures: (i) the relevancy score (RS), assessing the relevance of retrieved entries to the query, and (ii) the correctness score (CS), evaluating the accuracy of the generated response. We train RS and CS models using a ChatGPT-derived database and human evaluator samples. Results show that both models achieve ~88% accuracy on test data. Additionally, we construct a 5000-sample human-annotated database evaluating the relevancy of retrieved pieces and the correctness of response statements. Our RS model aligns with human preferences 20% more often than CLIP in retrieval, and our CS model matches human preferences ~91% of the time. Finally, we assess various RAG systems' selection and generation performances using RS and CS.</p></details> |  |

Despite their remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on visual stimuli, the alignment of these models with human perception in identifying relevant elements in images requires further exploration. This paper investigates the alignment between state-of-the-art LLMs and human annotators in detecting elements of relevance within home environment scenarios. We created a set of twelve images depicting various domestic scenarios and enlisted fourteen annotators to identify the key element in each image. We then compared these human responses with outputs from five different LLMs, including GPT-4o and four LLaVA variants. Our findings reveal a varied degree of alignment, with LLaVA 34B showing the highest performance but still scoring low. However, an analysis of the results highlights the models' potential to detect value-laden elements in images, suggesting that with improved training and refined prompts, LLMs could enhance applications in social robotics, assistive technologies, and human-computer interaction by providing deeper insights and more contextually relevant responses.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

While such capability is largely attributed to the rich world knowledge contained within the Large Language Models (LLMs), our work reveals their shortcomings in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) across six different benchmark settings. Most recent state-of-the-art LVLMs like LLaVa-1.5, InstructBLIP and GPT-4V not only severely deteriorate in terms of classification performance, e.g., average drop of 65.58 in EM for Stanford Dogs for LLaVA-1.5, but also struggle to generate an accurate explanation with detailed attributes based on the concept that appears within an input image despite their capability to generate holistic image-level descriptions. In-depth analyses show that instruction-tuned LVLMs exhibit modality gap, showing discrepancy when given textual and visual inputs that correspond to the same concept, preventing the image modality from leveraging the rich parametric knowledge within the LLMs. In an effort to further the community's endeavor in this direction, we propose a multiple granularity attribute-centric evaluation benchmark, Finer, which aims to establish a ground to evaluate LVLMs' fine-grained visual comprehension ability and provide significantly improved explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024; Main Conference</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models(VLM) excel in high-level commonsense reasoning, they lack the fine-grained 3D spatial understanding required for precise manipulation tasks. Fine-tuning VLM on robotic datasets to create Vision-Language-Action Models(VLA) is a potential solution, but it is hindered by high data collection costs and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel object-centric representation that bridges the gap between VLM's high-level reasoning and the low-level precision required for manipulation. Our key insight is that an object's canonical space, defined by its functional affordances, provides a structured and semantically meaningful way to describe interaction primitives, such as points and directions. These primitives act as a bridge, translating VLM's commonsense reasoning into actionable 3D spatial constraints. In this context, we introduce a dual closed-loop, open-vocabulary robotic manipulation system: one loop for high-level planning through primitive resampling, interaction rendering and VLM checking, and another for low-level execution via 6D pose tracking. This design ensures robust, real-time control without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, highlighting the potential of this approach for automating large-scale simulation data generation.</p></details> |  |

Vision-language models like CLIP show potential in ZSAD but have limitations: relying on manually crafted fixed textual descriptions or anomaly prompts is time-consuming and prone to semantic ambiguity, and CLIP struggles with pixel-level anomaly segmentation, focusing more on global semantics than local details. To address these limitations, We introduce KAnoCLIP, a novel ZSAD framework that leverages vision-language models. KAnoCLIP combines general knowledge from a Large Language Model (GPT-3.5) and fine-grained, image-specific knowledge from a Visual Question Answering system (Llama3) via Knowledge-Driven Prompt Learning (KnPL). KnPL uses a knowledge-driven (KD) loss function to create learnable anomaly prompts, removing the need for fixed text prompts and enhancing generalization. KAnoCLIP includes the CLIP visual encoder with V-V attention (CLIP-VV), Bi-Directional Cross-Attention for Multi-Level Cross-Modal Interaction (Bi-CMCI), and Conv-Adapter. These components preserve local visual semantics, improve local cross-modal fusion, and align global visual features with textual information, enhancing pixel-level anomaly detection. KAnoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZSAD across 12 industrial and medical datasets, demonstrating superior generalization compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Hand-drawn sketches are one of the intuitive ways to control robots with 2D devices. However, since similar sketches have different intentions from scene to scene, existing work needs additional modalities to set the sketches' semantics. This requires complex operations for users and leads to decreasing usability. In this paper, we propose Sketch-MoMa, a teleoperation system using the user-given hand-drawn sketches as instructions to control a robot. We use Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the user-given sketches superimposed on an observation image and infer drawn shapes and low-level tasks of the robot. We utilize the sketches and the generated shapes for recognition and motion planning of the generated low-level tasks for precise and intuitive operations. We validate our approach using state-of-the-art VLMs with 7 tasks and 5 sketch shapes. We also demonstrate that our approach effectively specifies the detailed motions, such as how to grasp and how much to rotate. Moreover, we show the competitive usability of our approach compared with the existing 2D interface through a user experiment with 14 participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

However, previous works on transductive or test-time adaptation (TTA) often make strong assumptions about the data distribution, such as the presence of all classes. Our work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios, and introduces a more realistic evaluation framework, including: (i) a variable number of effective classes for adaptation within a single batch, and (ii) non-i.i.d. batches of test samples in online adaptation settings. We provide comprehensive evaluations, comparisons, and ablation studies that demonstrate how current transductive or TTA methods for VLMs systematically compromise the models' initial zero-shot robustness across various realistic scenarios, favoring performance gains under advantageous assumptions about the test samples' distributions. Furthermore, we introduce StatA, a versatile method that could handle a wide range of deployment scenarios, including those with a variable number of effective classes at test time. Our approach incorporates a novel regularization term designed specifically for VLMs, which acts as a statistical anchor preserving the initial text-encoder knowledge, particularly in low-data regimes.

Significant progress has been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, but most require much labeled data for training. Consequently, developing precise segmentation methods that demand fewer labeled datasets is paramount in medical image analysis. The emergence of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, recently opened the door for universal computer vision tasks. Exploiting the generalization ability of these pre-trained foundation models on downstream tasks, such as segmentation, leads to unexpected performance with a relatively small amount of labeled data. However, exploring these models for pulmonary artery-vein segmentation is still limited. This paper proposes a novel framework called Language-guided self-adaptive Cross-Attention Fusion Framework. Our method adopts pre-trained CLIP as a strong feature extractor for generating the segmentation of 3D CT scans, while adaptively aggregating the cross-modality of text and image representations. We propose a s pecially designed adapter module to fine-tune pre-trained CLIP with a self-adaptive learning strategy to effectively fuse the two modalities of embeddings. We extensively validate our method on a local dataset, which is the largest pulmonary artery-vein CT dataset to date and consists of 718 labeled data in total. The experiments show that our method outperformed other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our data and code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 8 pages,3 figures |

However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance.

However, multi-image reasoning tasks are still under-explored in the open-source community due to two main challenges: (1) scaling datasets with multiple correlated images and complex reasoning instructions is resource-intensive and maintaining quality is difficult, and (2) there is a lack of robust evaluation benchmarks for multi-image tasks. To address these issues, we introduce SMIR, an efficient synthetic data-generation pipeline for multi-image reasoning, and a high-quality dataset generated using this pipeline. Our pipeline efficiently extracts highly correlated images using multimodal embeddings, combining visual and descriptive information and leverages open-source LLMs to generate quality instructions. Using this pipeline, we generated 160K synthetic training samples, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive closed-source solutions. Additionally, we present SMIR-BENCH, a novel multi-image reasoning evaluation benchmark comprising 200 diverse examples across 7 complex multi-image reasoning tasks. SMIR-BENCH is multi-turn and utilizes a VLM judge to evaluate free-form responses, providing a comprehensive assessment of model expressiveness and reasoning capability across modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMIR dataset by fine-tuning several open-source VLMs and evaluating their performance on SMIR-BENCH. Our results show that models trained on our dataset outperform baseline models in multi-image reasoning tasks up to 8% with a much more scalable data pipeline.</p></details> |  |

It originates from the classical Bongard Problems (BPs): Given two sets of images (positive and negative), the model needs to identify the set that query images belong to by inducing the visual concepts, which is exclusively depicted by images from the positive set. Our benchmark inherits the few-shot concept induction of the original BPs while adding the two novel layers of challenge: 1) open-world free-form concepts, as the visual concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are unique compositions of terms from an open vocabulary, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge; 2) real-world images, as opposed to the synthetic diagrams used by many counterparts. In our exploration, Bongard-OpenWorld already imposes a significant challenge to current few-shot reasoning algorithms. We further investigate to which extent the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve our task, by directly probing VLMs, and combining VLMs and LLMs in an interactive reasoning scheme. We even conceived a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs & VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard Problems. However, none of these approaches manage to close the human-machine gap, as the best learner achieves 64% accuracy while human participants easily reach 91%. We hope Bongard-OpenWorld can help us better understand the limitations of current visual intelligence and facilitate future research on visual agents with stronger few-shot visual reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), in particular, learn from vast and diverse data sources, allowing rich and nuanced representations of the world and, thereby, providing extensive capabilities, including the ability to reason, engage in meaningful dialog; collaborate with humans and other agents to jointly solve complex problems; and understand social and emotional aspects of humans. Despite this impressive feat, the cognitive abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs trained on large-scale datasets are still superficial and brittle. Consequently, generic LLMs are severely limited in their generalist capabilities. A number of foundational problems -- embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory -- are required to be addressed for LLMs to attain human-level general intelligence. These concepts are more aligned with human cognition and provide LLMs with inherent human-like cognitive properties that support the realization of physically-plausible, semantically meaningful, flexible and more generalizable knowledge and intelligence. In this work, we discuss the aforementioned foundational issues and survey state-of-the art approaches for implementing these concepts in LLMs. Specifically, we discuss how the principles of embodiment, symbol grounding, causality and memory can be leveraged toward the attainment of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in an organic manner.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs via fine-grained AI feedback. The basic idea is that we generate a small-size sentence-level hallucination annotation dataset by proprietary models, whereby we train a hallucination detection model which can perform sentence-level hallucination detection, covering primary hallucination types (i.e., object, attribute, and relationship). Then, we propose a detect-then-rewrite pipeline to automatically construct preference dataset for training hallucination mitigating model. Furthermore, we propose differentiating the severity of hallucinations, and introducing a Hallucination Severity-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (HSA-DPO) for mitigating hallucination in LVLMs by incorporating the severity of hallucinations into preference learning.

To address this challenge, we introduce Infinity-MM, a large-scale multimodal instruction dataset.

However, a crucial capability - fine-grained motion comprehension - remains under-explored in current benchmarks. To address this gap, we propose MotionBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained motion comprehension of video understanding models. MotionBench evaluates models' motion-level perception through six primary categories of motion-oriented question types and includes data collected from diverse sources, ensuring a broad representation of real-world video content. Experimental results reveal that existing VLMs perform poorly in understanding fine-grained motions. To enhance VLM's ability to perceive fine-grained motion within a limited sequence length of LLM, we conduct extensive experiments reviewing VLM architectures optimized for video feature compression and propose a novel and efficient Through-Encoder (TE) Fusion method. Experiments show that higher frame rate inputs and TE Fusion yield improvements in motion understanding, yet there is still substantial room for enhancement.

Interpretability is crucial for safely deploying such algorithms in high-stakes medical domains. Traditional MIL methods offer explanations by highlighting salient regions. However, such spatial heatmaps provide limited insights for end users. To address this, we propose a novel inherently interpretable WSI-classification approach that uses human-understandable pathology concepts to generate explanations. Our proposed Concept MIL model leverages recent advances in vision-language models to directly predict pathology concepts based on image features. The model's predictions are obtained through a linear combination of the concepts identified on the top-K patches of a WSI, enabling inherent explanations by tracing each concept's influence on the prediction. In contrast to traditional concept-based interpretable models, our approach eliminates the need for costly human annotations by leveraging the vision-language model. We validate our method on two widely used pathology datasets: Camelyon16 and PANDA. On both datasets, Concept MIL achieves AUC and accuracy scores over 0.9, putting it on par with state-of-the-art models. We further find that 87.1\% (Camelyon16) and 85.3\% (PANDA) of the top 20 patches fall within the tumor region. A user study shows that the concepts identified by our model align with the concepts used by pathologists, making it a promising strategy for human-interpretable WSI classification.</p></details> |  |

While marketed as providing auto-steering capabilities, the system's operational characteristics and safety performance remain underexplored, primarily due to a lack of real-world testing and comprehensive data. To fill this gap, we extensively tested mainstream LKA systems from leading U.S. automakers in Tampa, Florida. Using an innovative method, we collected a comprehensive dataset that includes full Controller Area Network (CAN) messages with LKA attributes, as well as video, perception, and lateral trajectory data from a high-quality front-facing camera equipped with advanced vision detection and trajectory planning algorithms. Our tests spanned diverse, challenging conditions, including complex road geometry, adverse weather, degraded lane markings, and their combinations. A vision language model (VLM) further annotated the videos to capture weather, lighting, and traffic features. Based on this dataset, we present an empirical overview of LKA's operational features and safety performance. Key findings indicate: (i) LKA is vulnerable to faint markings and low pavement contrast; (ii) it struggles in lane transitions (merges, diverges, intersections), often causing unintended departures or disengagements; (iii) steering torque limitations lead to frequent deviations on sharp turns, posing safety risks; and (iv) LKA systems consistently maintain rigid lane-centering, lacking adaptability on tight curves or near large vehicles such as trucks. We conclude by demonstrating how this dataset can guide both infrastructure planning and self-driving technology.

Towards systematic study of such issues, we introduce a synthetic framework for assessing the ability of VLMs to perform algorithmic visual reasoning (AVR), comprising three tasks: Table Readout, Grid Navigation, and Visual Analogy. Each has two levels of difficulty, SIMPLE and HARD, and even the SIMPLE versions are difficult for frontier VLMs. We seek strategies for training on the SIMPLE version of the tasks that improve performance on the corresponding HARD task, i.e., S2H generalization. This synthetic framework, where each task also has a text-only version, allows a quantification of the modality imbalance, and how it is impacted by training strategy. Ablations highlight the importance of explicit image-to-text conversion in promoting S2H generalization when using auto-regressive training. We also report results of mechanistic study of this phenomenon, including a measure of gradient alignment that seems to identify training strategies that promote better S2H generalization.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis confirms this hypothesis, revealing that the widely used cosine similarity metric is prone to false positive reward estimates. To address this, we introduce BiMI ({Bi}nary {M}utual {I}nformation), a novel reward function designed to mitigate noise.

Federated learning offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across distributed data sources without requiring data centralization. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which typically contain billions of parameters, pose significant communication challenges for traditional federated learning approaches based on model parameter updates, as they would incur substantial communication costs. In this paper, we propose FedRSCLIP, the first federated learning framework designed for remote sensing image classification based on a VLM, specifically CLIP. FedRSCLIP addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity and large-scale model transmission in federated environments by introducing Prompt Learning, which optimizes only a small set of tunable parameters. The framework introduces a dual-prompt mechanism, comprising Shared Prompts for global knowledge sharing and Private Prompts for client-specific adaptation. To maintain semantic coherence between shared and private prompts, we propose the Dual Prompt Alignment Constraint to balance global consistency and local adaptability across diverse client distributions. Additionally, to enhance cross-modal representation learning, we introduce the Cross-Modal Feature Alignment Constraint to align multimodal features between text and image prompts. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we construct a Fed-RSIC dataset based on three existing remote sensing image classification datasets, specifically designed to simulate various federated learning configurations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of FedRSCLIP in remote sensing image classification.</p></details> |  |

We introduce NTSEBench, a new dataset designed to evaluate cognitive multi-modal reasoning and problem-solving skills of large models. The dataset contains 2728 multiple-choice questions, accompanied by a total of 4,642 images, categorized into 26 different types. These questions are drawn from the nationwide NTSE examination in India and feature a mix of visual and textual general aptitude challenges, designed to assess intelligence and critical thinking skills beyond mere rote learning.

However, these works primarily operate at the whole-image level, aligning general information from 2D medical images without attending to finer details. As a result, these models often provide irrelevant or non-clinically valuable information while missing critical details. Medical vision-language tasks differ significantly from general images, particularly in their focus on fine-grained details, while excluding irrelevant content. General domain VLMs tend to prioritize global information due to their design, which compresses the entire image into a multi-token representation that is passed into the LLM decoder. Therefore, current VLMs all lack the capability to restrict their attention to particular areas. To address this critical issue in the medical domain, we introduce MedVP, an visual prompt generation and fine-tuning framework, which involves extract medical entities, generate visual prompts, and adapt datasets for visual prompt guided fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly introduce visual prompt into medical VLMs, and we successfully outperform recent state-of-the-art large models across multiple medical VQA datasets. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyze the impact of different visual prompt forms and how they contribute to performance improvement. The results demonstrate both the effectiveness and clinical significance of our approach</p></details> |  |

With the recent progress of vision-language models (VLMs), employing VLMs to improve this field has emerged as a popular research topic. However, most existing methods are studied on self-built question-answering datasets, lacking a unified training and testing benchmark for walk guidance. Moreover, in blind walking task, it is necessary to perform real-time streaming video parsing and generate concise yet informative reminders, which poses a great challenge for VLMs that suffer from redundant responses and low inference efficiency. In this paper, we firstly release a diverse, extensive, and unbiased walking awareness dataset, containing 12k video-manual annotation pairs from Europe and Asia to provide a fair training and testing benchmark for blind walking task. Furthermore, a WalkVLM model is proposed, which employs chain of thought for hierarchical planning to generate concise but informative reminders and utilizes temporal-aware adaptive prediction to reduce the temporal redundancy of reminders. Finally, we have established a solid benchmark for blind walking task and verified the advantages of WalkVLM in stream video processing for this task compared to other VLMs. Our dataset and code will be released at anonymous link https://walkvlm2024.github.io.</p></details> |  |

This is particularly critical for object detection tasks, where domain shifts (caused by factors such as lighting conditions, viewing angles, and environmental variations) can lead to significant performance degradation. This review delves into advanced methodologies for domain adaptation, including adversarial learning, discrepancy-based, multi-domain, teacher-student, ensemble, and Vision Language Models techniques, emphasizing their efficacy in reducing domain gaps and enhancing model robustness. Feature-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for addressing these challenges by harmonizing feature representations across domains. These techniques, such as Feature Alignment, Feature Augmentation/Reconstruction, and Feature Transformation, are employed alongside or as integral parts of other domain adaptation strategies to minimize domain gaps and improve model performance. Special attention is given to strategies that minimize the reliance on extensive labeled data and using unlabeled data, particularly in scenarios involving synthetic-to-real domain shifts. Applications in fields such as autonomous driving and medical imaging are explored, showcasing the potential of these methods to ensure reliable object detection in diverse and complex settings. By providing a thorough analysis of state-of-the-art techniques, challenges, and future directions, this work offers a valuable reference for researchers striving to develop resilient and adaptable object detection frameworks, advancing the seamless deployment of artificial intelligence in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 13 figures, It will be submitted to the Artificial Intelligence Review journal</p></details> |

One critical form of stereotyping reproduced by these models is homogeneity bias-the tendency to represent certain groups as more homogeneous than others. We investigate how this bias responds to hyperparameter adjustments in GPT-4, specifically examining sampling temperature and top p which control the randomness of model outputs. By generating stories about individuals from different racial and gender groups and comparing their similarities using vector representations, we assess both bias robustness and its relationship with hyperparameter values. We find that (1) homogeneity bias persists across most hyperparameter configurations, with Black Americans and women being represented more homogeneously than White Americans and men, (2) the relationship between hyperparameters and group representations shows unexpected non-linear patterns, particularly at extreme values, and (3) hyperparameter adjustments affect racial and gender homogeneity bias differently-while increasing temperature or decreasing top p can reduce racial homogeneity bias, these changes show different effects on gender homogeneity bias. Our findings suggest that while hyperparameter tuning may mitigate certain biases to some extent, it cannot serve as a universal solution for addressing homogeneity bias across different social group dimensions.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional EAs face challenges in dynamically adapting to expanding knowledge bases, hindering the efficient exploitation of accumulated information and limiting adaptability to new situations. To address these issues, we introduce an Optimization Knowledge Adaptation Evolutionary Model (OKAEM), which features dynamic parameter adjustment using accumulated knowledge to enhance its optimization capabilities. OKAEM employs attention mechanisms to model the interactions among individuals, fitness landscapes, and genetic components separately, thereby parameterizing the evolutionary operators of selection, crossover, and mutation. These powerful learnable operators enable OKAEM to benefit from pre-learned extensive prior knowledge and self-tune with real-time evolutionary insights. Experimental results demonstrate that OKAEM: 1) exploits prior knowledge for significant performance gains across various knowledge transfer settings; 2) achieves competitive performance through self-tuning alone, even without prior knowledge; 3) outperforms state-of-the-art black-box baselines in a vision-language model tuning case; 4) can improve its optimization capabilities with growing knowledge; 5) is capable of emulating principles of natural selection and genetic recombination.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to Springer Nature for possible publication</p></details> |

Despite their success, LVLMs still suffer from generating hallucinations in complex generation tasks, leading to inconsistencies between visual inputs and generated content. To address this issue, some approaches have introduced inference-time interventions, such as contrastive decoding and attention rectification, to reduce overreliance on language priors. However, these approaches overlook hallucinations stemming from spurious inter-modality correlations. In this paper, we propose an Inter-Modality Correlation Calibration Decoding (IMCCD) method to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs in a training-free manner. In this method, we design a Cross-Modal Value-Enhanced Decoding(CMVED) module to alleviate hallucination by a novel contrastive decoding mechanism. During the estimation of distorted distribution, CMVED masks the value vectors associated with significant cross-modal attention weights, which address both uni-modality overreliance and misleading inter-modality correlations. Additionally, a Content-Driven Attention Refinement(CDAR) module refines cross-modal attention weights, guiding LVLMs to focus on important visual content. Experimental results on diverse hallucination benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art techniques in reducing hallucinations in LVLM text generation.

Multiple heads intuitively enable different parallel processes over the same input. Yet, they also obscure the attribution of each input patch to the output of a model. We propose a novel 1-head Transformer Attention Bottleneck (TAB) layer, inserted after the traditional MHSA architecture, to serve as an attention bottleneck for interpretability and intervention. Unlike standard self-attention, TAB constrains the total attention over all patches to $\in [0, 1]$. That is, when the total attention is 0, no visual information is propagated further into the network and the vision-language model (VLM) would default to a generic, image-independent response. To demonstrate the advantages of TAB, we train VLMs with TAB to perform image difference captioning. Over three datasets, our models perform similarly to baseline VLMs in captioning but the bottleneck is superior in localizing changes and in identifying when no changes occur. TAB is the first architecture to enable users to intervene by editing attention, which often produces expected outputs by VLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, such existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence between images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos (e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn foundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM training. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality \textbf{multimodal textbook} corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It collects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours. We first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional videos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio (ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an image-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its counterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer knowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb pretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook exhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and textual cues in their few-shot context for task solving~\footnote{Our code are available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/multimodal_textbook}}.</p></details> | Under review |

A common solution is to leverage powerful vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to bridge the gap between vision and text information. However, VLMs are typically pretrained for image-level vision-text alignment, focusing on global semantic features. In contrast, segmentation tasks require fine-grained pixel-level alignment and detailed category boundary information, which VLMs alone cannot provide. As a result, information extracted directly from VLMs can't meet the requirements of segmentation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose FGAseg, a model designed for fine-grained pixel-text alignment and category boundary supplementation. The core of FGAseg is a Pixel-Level Alignment module that employs a cross-modal attention mechanism and a text-pixel alignment loss to refine the coarse-grained alignment from CLIP, achieving finer-grained pixel-text semantic alignment. Additionally, to enrich category boundary information, we introduce the alignment matrices as optimizable pseudo-masks during forward propagation and propose Category Information Supplementation module. These pseudo-masks, derived from cosine and convolutional similarity, provide essential global and local boundary information between different categories. By combining these two strategies, FGAseg effectively enhances pixel-level alignment and category boundary information, addressing key challenges in open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FGAseg outperforms existing methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Recent research discovered that the mid-layer representation of the subject's final token in a prompt has a strong influence on factual predictions, and developed Large Language Model (LLM) editing techniques based on this observation. However, for Vision-LLMs (VLLMs), how visual representations impact the predictions from a decoder-only language model remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, model editing for VLLMs has not been extensively studied in the literature. In this work, we employ the contribution allocation and noise perturbation methods to measure the contributions of visual representations for token predictions. Our attribution analysis shows that visual representations in mid-to-later layers that are highly relevant to the prompt contribute significantly to predictions. Based on these insights, we propose VisEdit, a novel model editor for VLLMs that effectively corrects knowledge by editing intermediate visual representations in regions important to the edit prompt. We evaluated VisEdit using multiple VLLM backbones and public VLLM editing benchmark datasets. The results show the superiority of VisEdit over the strong baselines adapted from existing state-of-the-art editors for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI-2025</p></details> |

To leverage the various capabilities of these encoders, recent studies incorporate multiple encoders within a single VLM, leading to a considerable increase in computational cost. In this paper, we present Mixture-of-Visual-Encoder Knowledge Distillation (MoVE-KD), a novel framework that distills the unique proficiencies of multiple vision encoders into a single, efficient encoder model. Specifically, to mitigate conflicts and retain the unique characteristics of each teacher encoder, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and mixture-of-experts (MoEs) to selectively activate specialized knowledge based on input features, enhancing both adaptability and efficiency. To regularize the KD process and enhance performance, we propose an attention-based distillation strategy that adaptively weighs the different visual encoders and emphasizes valuable visual tokens, reducing the burden of replicating comprehensive but distinct features from multiple teachers. Comprehensive experiments on popular VLMs, such as LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, validate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be released.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Unraveling Safety Attention Heads in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02029v1)** | 2025-01-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.02029v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the integration of an additional modality, large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit greater vulnerability to safety risks (e.g., jailbreaking) compared to their language-only predecessors. Although recent studies have devoted considerable effort to the post-hoc alignment of LVLMs, the inner safety mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we discover that internal activations of LVLMs during the first token generation can effectively identify malicious prompts across different attacks. This inherent safety perception is governed by sparse attention heads, which we term ``safety heads." Further analysis reveals that these heads act as specialized shields against malicious prompts; ablating them leads to higher attack success rates, while the model's utility remains unaffected. By locating these safety heads and concatenating their activations, we construct a straightforward but powerful malicious prompt detector that integrates seamlessly into the generation process with minimal extra inference overhead. Despite its simple structure of a logistic regression model, the detector surprisingly exhibits strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. Experiments across various prompt-based attacks confirm the effectiveness of leveraging safety heads to protect LVLMs. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Ziwei-Zheng/SAHs}.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose CLIP-UP: CLIP-based Unanswerable Problem detection, a novel lightweight method for equipping VLMs with the ability to withhold answers to unanswerable questions. By leveraging CLIP to extract question-image alignment information, CLIP-UP requires only efficient training of a few additional layers, while keeping the original VLMs' weights unchanged.

To this end, we propose a novel Token Preference Optimization model with self-calibrated rewards (dubbed as TPO), which adaptively attends to visual-correlated tokens without fine-grained annotations. Specifically, we introduce a token-level \emph{visual-anchored} \emph{reward} as the difference of the logistic distributions of generated tokens conditioned on the raw image and the corrupted one. In addition, to highlight the informative visual-anchored tokens, a visual-aware training objective is proposed to enhance more accurate token-level optimization. Extensive experimental results have manifested the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed TPO.

However, progress in learning universal multimodal embedding models has been relatively slow despite its importance and practicality. In this work, we aim to explore the potential for building universal embeddings capable of handling a wide range of downstream tasks. Our contributions are twofold: (1) MMEB (Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark), which covers 4 meta-tasks (i.e. classification, visual question answering, multimodal retrieval, and visual grounding) and 36 datasets, including 20 training and 16 evaluation datasets covering both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, and (2) VLM2Vec (Vision-Language Model -> Vector), a contrastive training framework that converts any state-of-the-art vision-language model into an embedding model via training on MMEB. Unlike previous models such as CLIP and BLIP, which encodes text or images independently without any task instruction, VLM2Vec can process any combination of images and text to generate a fixed-dimensional vector based on task instructions. We build a series of VLM2Vec models on SoTA VLMs like Phi-3.5-V, LLaVA-1.6 and evaluate them on MMEB's evaluation split. Our results show that VLM2Vec achieves an absolute average improvement of 10% to 20% over existing multimodal embedding models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets in MMEB. We show that VLMs are secretly strong embedding models.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Despite their advantages, these models, akin to other foundational systems, inherit biases from the disproportionate distribution of real-world data, leading to misconceptions about the actual environment. Prevalent datasets like ImageNet are often riddled with non-causal, spurious correlations that can diminish VLM performance in scenarios where these contextual elements are absent. This study presents an investigation into how a simple linear probe can effectively distill task-specific core features from CLIP's embedding for downstream applications. Our analysis reveals that the CLIP text representations are often tainted by spurious correlations, inherited in the biased pre-training dataset. Empirical evidence suggests that relying on visual representations from CLIP, as opposed to text embedding, is more practical to refine the skewed perceptions in VLMs, emphasizing the superior utility of visual representations in overcoming embedded biases. Our codes will be available here.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Vision-Language Alignment for Text-to-Image Generation via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00917v1)** | 2025-01-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.00917v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has witnessed significant advancements with the integration of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), yet challenges remain in aligning complex textual descriptions with high-quality, visually coherent images. This paper introduces the Vision-Language Aligned Diffusion (VLAD) model, a generative framework that addresses these challenges through a dual-stream strategy combining semantic alignment and hierarchical diffusion. VLAD utilizes a Contextual Composition Module (CCM) to decompose textual prompts into global and local representations, ensuring precise alignment with visual features. Furthermore, it incorporates a multi-stage diffusion process with hierarchical guidance to generate high-fidelity images. Experiments conducted on MARIO-Eval and INNOVATOR-Eval benchmarks demonstrate that VLAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image quality, semantic alignment, and text rendering accuracy. Human evaluations further validate the superior performance of VLAD, making it a promising approach for text-to-image generation in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks focus on classical cognitive illusions, which have been learned by state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, revealing issues such as hallucinations and limited perceptual abilities. To address this gap, we introduce IllusionBench, a comprehensive visual illusion dataset that encompasses not only classic cognitive illusions but also real-world scene illusions. This dataset features 1,051 images, 5,548 question-answer pairs, and 1,051 golden text descriptions that address the presence, causes, and content of the illusions. We evaluate ten SOTA VLMs on this dataset using true-or-false, multiple-choice, and open-ended tasks. In addition to real-world illusions, we design trap illusions that resemble classical patterns but differ in reality, highlighting hallucination issues in SOTA models. The top-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves 80.59% accuracy on true-or-false tasks and 76.75% on multiple-choice questions, but still lags behind human performance. In the semantic description task, GPT-4o's hallucinations on classical illusions result in low scores for trap illusions, even falling behind some open-source models. IllusionBench is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual illusions in VLMs to date.</p></details> |  |

Despite their progress, challenges remain in both prompt-following ability, image quality and lack of high-quality datasets, which are essential for refining these models. As acquiring labeled data is costly, we introduce AGFSync, a framework that enhances T2I diffusion models through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in a fully AI-driven approach. AGFSync utilizes Vision-Language Models (VLM) to assess image quality across style, coherence, and aesthetics, generating feedback data within an AI-driven loop. By applying AGFSync to leading T2I models such as SD v1.4, v1.5, and SDXL-base, our extensive experiments on the TIFA dataset demonstrate notable improvements in VQA scores, aesthetic evaluations, and performance on the HPSv2 benchmark, consistently outperforming the base models. AGFSync's method of refining T2I diffusion models paves the way for scalable alignment techniques.

To address this limitation, we introduce SmartSpatial, an innovative approach that enhances the spatial arrangement capabilities of Stable Diffusion models through 3D-aware conditioning and attention-guided mechanisms. SmartSpatial incorporates depth information and employs cross-attention control to ensure precise object placement, delivering notable improvements in spatial accuracy metrics. In conjunction with SmartSpatial, we present SmartSpatialEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess spatial relationships. This framework utilizes vision-language models and graph-based dependency parsing for performance analysis. Experimental results on the COCO and SpatialPrompts datasets show that SmartSpatial significantly outperforms existing methods, setting new benchmarks for spatial arrangement accuracy in image generation.</p></details> |  |

To examine the situation, we introduce ViLP, a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark that pairs each question with three potential answers and three corresponding images: one image whose answer can be inferred from text alone, and two images that demand visual reasoning. By leveraging image generative models, we ensure significant variation in texture, shape, conceptual combinations, hallucinated elements, and proverb-based contexts, making our benchmark images distinctly out-of-distribution. While humans achieve near-perfect accuracy, modern VLMs falter; for instance, GPT-4 achieves only 66.17% on ViLP. To alleviate this, we propose a self-improving framework in which models generate new VQA pairs and images, then apply pixel-level and semantic corruptions to form "good-bad" image pairs for self-training. Our training objectives compel VLMs to focus more on actual visual inputs and have demonstrated their effectiveness in enhancing the performance of open-source VLMs, including LLaVA-v1.5 and Cambrian.</p></details> |  |

Continuous prompts parameterize context tokens in prompts by turning them into differentiable vectors. Deep continuous prompts insert prompts not only in the input but also in the intermediate hidden representations. Manually designed deep continuous prompts exhibit a remarkable improvement compared to the zero-shot pre-trained model on downstream tasks. How to automate the continuous prompt design is an underexplored area, and a fundamental question arises, is manually designed deep prompt strategy optimal? To answer this question, we propose a method dubbed differentiable prompt learning (DPL). The DPL method is formulated as an optimization problem to automatically determine the optimal context length of the prompt to be added to each layer, where the objective is to maximize the performance. We test the DPL method on the pre-trained CLIP. We empirically find that by using only limited data, our DPL method can find deep continuous prompt configuration with high confidence. The performance on the downstream tasks exhibits the superiority of the automatic design: our method boosts the average test accuracy by 2.60% on 11 datasets compared to baseline methods. Besides, our method focuses only on the prompt configuration (i.e. context length for each layer), which means that our method is compatible with the baseline methods that have sophisticated designs to boost the performance. The DPL method can be deployed to large language models or computer vision models at no cost.</p></details> |  |

Previous work has shown that one way to achieve this aim is to learn a structured abstract transition model in the form of symbolic predicates and operators, and then plan within this model to solve novel tasks at test time. However, these learned models do not ground directly into pixels from just a handful of demonstrations. In this work, we propose to invent predicates that operate directly over input images by leveraging the capabilities of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). Our key idea is that, given a set of demonstrations, a VLM can be used to propose a set of predicates that are potentially relevant for decision-making and then to determine the truth values of these predicates in both the given demonstrations and new image inputs. We build upon an existing framework for predicate invention, which generates feature-based predicates operating on object-centric states, to also generate visual predicates that operate on images. Experimentally, we show that our approach -- pix2pred -- is able to invent semantically meaningful predicates that enable generalization to novel, complex, and long-horizon tasks across two simulated robotic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Planning in the Era of LLMs (LM4Plan @ AAAI 2025)</p></details> |

We propose a large-scale and fully end-to-end diffusion model for multi-modal understanding and generation that significantly improves on existing diffusion-based multimodal models, and is the first of its kind to support the full suite of vision-language modeling capabilities. Inspired by the multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT) and recent advances in discrete diffusion language modeling, we leverage a cross-modal maximum likelihood estimation framework that simultaneously trains the conditional likelihoods of both images and text jointly under a single loss function, which is back-propagated through both branches of the diffusion transformer. The resulting model is highly flexible and capable of a wide range of tasks including image generation, captioning, and visual question answering. Our model attained competitive performance compared to recent unified image understanding and generation models, demonstrating the potential of multimodal diffusion modeling as a promising alternative to autoregressive next-token prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Existing token reduction methods primarily focus on importance-based token pruning, which overlooks the redundancy caused by frame resemblance and repetitive visual elements. In this paper, we analyze the high vision token similarities in LVLMs. We reveal that token similarity distribution condenses as layers deepen while maintaining ranking consistency. Leveraging the unique properties of similarity over importance, we introduce FrameFusion, a novel approach that combines similarity-based merging with importance-based pruning for better token reduction in LVLMs. FrameFusion identifies and merges similar tokens before pruning, opening up a new perspective for token reduction. We evaluate FrameFusion on diverse LVLMs, including Llava-Video-{7B,32B,72B}, and MiniCPM-V-8B, on video understanding, question-answering, and retrieval benchmarks. Experiments show that FrameFusion reduces vision tokens by 70$\%$, achieving 3.4-4.4x LLM speedups and 1.6-1.9x end-to-end speedups, with an average performance impact of less than 3$\%$.

In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data.

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing.

Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition.

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods. We suggest that this tool can improve the value of such sources in photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Biomedical Optics Express journal</p></details> |
| **[Fluence compensation for real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09572v1)** | 2020-01-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2001.09572v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently we demonstrated an integrated photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasound (PAUS) system using a kHz-rate wavelength-tunable laser and a swept-beam delivery approach. It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |
