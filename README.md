| **[A Dataset of Performance Measurements and Alerts from Mozilla (Data Artifact)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16332v1)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.16332v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance regressions in software systems can lead to significant financial losses and degraded user satisfaction, making their early detection and mitigation critical. Despite the importance of practices that capture performance regressions early, there is a lack of publicly available datasets that comprehensively capture real-world performance measurements, expert-validated alerts, and associated metadata such as bugs and testing conditions. To address this gap, we introduce a unique dataset to support various research studies in performance engineering, anomaly detection, and machine learning. This dataset was collected from Mozilla Firefox's performance testing infrastructure and comprises 5,655 performance time series, 17,989 performance alerts, and detailed annotations of resulting bugs collected from May 2023 to May 2024. By publishing this dataset, we provide researchers with an invaluable resource for studying performance trends, developing novel change point detection methods, and advancing performance regression analysis across diverse platforms and testing environments. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14642238</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional approaches aiming at direct prediction of system dynamics, CLINE identifies static geometric features of the phase space that encode the (non)linear relationships between state variables. It overcomes challenges such as multiple time scales and strong nonlinearities while producing interpretable results convertible into symbolic differential equations. We validate CLINE on various oscillatory systems, showcasing its effectiveness.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2302.01701v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-supervised New Activity Detection in Sensor-based Smart Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10288v2)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2401.10288v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of ubiquitous computing technology, human activity analysis based on time series data from a diverse range of sensors enables the delivery of more intelligent services. Despite the importance of exploring new activities in real-world scenarios, existing human activity recognition studies generally rely on predefined known activities and often overlook detecting new patterns (novelties) that have not been previously observed during training. Novelty detection in human activities becomes even more challenging due to (1) diversity of patterns within the same known activity, (2) shared patterns between known and new activities, and (3) differences in sensor properties of each activity dataset. We introduce CLAN, a two-tower model that leverages Contrastive Learning with diverse data Augmentation for New activity detection in sensor-based environments. CLAN simultaneously and explicitly utilizes multiple types of strongly shifted data as negative samples in contrastive learning, effectively learning invariant representations that adapt to various pattern variations within the same activity. To enhance the ability to distinguish between known and new activities that share common features, CLAN incorporates both time and frequency domains, enabling the learning of multi-faceted discriminative representations. Additionally, we design an automatic selection mechanism of data augmentation methods tailored to each dataset's properties, generating appropriate positive and negative pairs for contrastive learning. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CLAN achieves a 9.24% improvement in AUROC compared to the best-performing baseline model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Reservoir Computing for Chaotic Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15615v2)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.15615v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir Computing was shown in recent years to be useful as efficient to learn networks in the field of time series tasks. Their randomized initialization, a computational benefit, results in drawbacks in theoretical analysis of large random graphs, because of which deterministic variations are an still open field of research. Building upon Next-Gen Reservoir Computing and the Temporal Convolution Derived Reservoir Computing, we propose a deterministic alternative to the higher-dimensional mapping therein, TCRC-LM and TCRC-CM, utilizing the parametrized but deterministic Logistic mapping and Chebyshev maps. To further enhance the predictive capabilities in the task of time series forecasting, we propose the novel utilization of the Lobachevsky function as non-linear activation function. As a result, we observe a new, fully deterministic network being able to outperform TCRCs and classical Reservoir Computing in the form of the prominent Echo State Networks by up to $99.99\%$ for the non-chaotic time series and $87.13\%$ for the chaotic ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection in Industry 5.0](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15946v1)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.15946v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry5.0 environments present a critical need for effective anomaly detection methods that can indicate equipment malfunctions, process inefficiencies, or potential safety hazards. The ever-increasing sensorization of manufacturing lines makes processes more observable, but also poses the challenge of continuously analyzing vast amounts of multivariate time series data. These challenges include data quality since data may contain noise, be unlabeled or even mislabeled. A promising approach consists of combining an embedding model with other Machine Learning algorithms to enhance the overall performance in detecting anomalies. Moreover, representing time series as vectors brings many advantages like higher flexibility and improved ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. We tested our solution in a real industrial use case, using data collected from a Bonfiglioli plant. The results demonstrate that, unlike traditional reconstruction-based autoencoders, which often struggle in the presence of sporadic noise, our embedding-based framework maintains high performance across various noise conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Time Series Wildfire Spread Prediction: Modeling Improvements and the WSTS+ Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12003v2)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.12003v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has demonstrated the potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) to accurately predict wildfire spread on a given day based upon high-dimensional explanatory data from a single preceding day, or from a time series of T preceding days. Here, we introduce a variety of modeling improvements that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy for both single-day and multi-day input scenarios, as evaluated on a large public benchmark for next-day wildfire spread, termed the WildfireSpreadTS (WSTS) benchmark. Consistent with prior work, we found that models using time-series input obtained the best overall accuracy. Furthermore, we create a new benchmark, WSTS+, by incorporating four additional years of historical wildfire data into the WSTS benchmark. Our benchmark doubles the number of unique years of historical data, expands its geographic scope, and, to our knowledge, represents the largest public benchmark for time-series-based wildfire spread prediction.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[CLIMB: Data Foundations for Large Scale Multimodal Clinical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07667v2)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.07667v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in clinical AI have enabled remarkable progress across many clinical domains. However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOCAL: Learning with Orientation Matrix to Infer Causal Structure from Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19464v4)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.19464v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from time series observational data is highly challenging due to the dynamic nature and complex nonlinear interactions between variables. Existing methods typically search for the optimal DAG by optimizing an objective function but face scalability challenges, as their computational demands grow exponentially with the dimensional expansion of variables. To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. Building on this, we introduce two adaptive modules that enhance the algebraic characterization of acyclicity: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML constructs causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring DAG formation while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic causal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[KDSelector: A Knowledge-Enhanced and Data-Efficient Model Selector Learning Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12478v2)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.12478v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model selection has been raised as an essential problem in the area of time series anomaly detection (TSAD), because there is no single best TSAD model for the highly heterogeneous time series in real-world applications. However, despite the success of existing model selection solutions that train a classification model (especially neural network, NN) using historical data as a selector to predict the correct TSAD model for each series, the NN-based selector learning methods used by existing solutions do not make full use of the knowledge in the historical data and require iterating over all training samples, which limits the accuracy and training speed of the selector. To address these limitations, we propose KDSelector, a novel knowledge-enhanced and data-efficient framework for learning the NN-based TSAD model selector, of which three key components are specifically designed to integrate available knowledge into the selector and dynamically prune less important and redundant samples during the learning. We develop a TSAD model selection system with KDSelector as the internal, to demonstrate how users improve the accuracy and training speed of their selectors by using KDSelector as a plug-and-play module.

| **[Line Space Clustering (LSC): Feature-Based Clustering using K-medians and Dynamic Time Warping for Versatility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15777v1)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.15777v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering high-dimensional data is a critical challenge in machine learning due to the curse of dimensionality and the presence of noise. Traditional clustering algorithms often fail to capture the intrinsic structures in such data. This paper explores a combination of clustering methods, which we called Line Space Clustering (LSC), a representation that transforms data points into lines in a newly defined feature space, enabling clustering based on the similarity of feature value patterns, essentially treating features as sequences. LSC employs a combined distance metric that uses Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances, weighted by a parameter {\alpha}, allowing flexibility in emphasizing shape or magnitude similarities. We delve deeply into the mechanics of DTW and the Savitzky Golay filter, explaining their roles in the algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of LSC on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that randomly experimenting with time-series optimized methods sometimes might surprisingly work on a complex dataset, particularly in noisy environments.

| **[Time Series Classification of Supraglacial Lakes Evolution over Greenland Ice Sheet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05638v2)** | 2025-03-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.05638v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has emerged as a significant contributor to global sea level rise, primarily due to increased meltwater runoff. Supraglacial lakes, which form on the ice sheet surface during the summer months, can impact ice sheet dynamics and mass loss; thus, better understanding these lakes' seasonal evolution and dynamics is an important task. This study presents a computationally efficient time series classification approach that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of the Reconstructed Phase Spaces (RPSs) to identify supraglacial lakes based on their seasonal evolution: 1) those that refreeze at the end of the melt season, 2) those that drain during the melt season, and 3) those that become buried, remaining liquid insulated a few meters beneath the surface. Our approach uses time series data from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, which utilize microwave and visible radiation, respectively. Evaluated on a GrIS-wide dataset, the RPS-GMM model, trained on a single representative sample per class, achieves 85.46% accuracy with Sentinel-1 data alone and 89.70% with combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. This performance significantly surpasses existing machine learning and deep learning models which require a large training data. The results demonstrate the robustness of the RPS-GMM model in capturing the complex temporal dynamics of supraglacial lakes with minimal training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA).

| **[Macroeconomic Forecasting with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00890v3)** | 2025-03-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.00890v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comparative analysis evaluating the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) against traditional macro time series forecasting approaches. In recent times, LLMs have surged in popularity for forecasting due to their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and quickly adapt across very different domains. However, their effectiveness in forecasting macroeconomic time series data compared to conventional methods remains an area of interest. To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against traditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD database. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in forecasting macroeconomic time series, shedding light on their applicability in real-world scenarios</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Encoding Strategies for Energy Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15456v1)** | 2025-03-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.15456v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contemporary power systems, energy consumption prediction plays a crucial role in maintaining grid stability and resource allocation enabling power companies to minimize energy waste and avoid overloading the grid. While there are several research works on energy optimization, they often fail to address the complexities of real-time fluctuations and the cyclic pattern of energy consumption. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of predictive models by employing sinusoidal encoding on periodic features of time-series data. To demonstrate the increase in performance, several statistical and ensemble machine learning models were trained on an energy demand dataset, using the proposed sinusoidal encoding. The performance of these models was then benchmarked against identical models trained on traditional encoding methods. The results demonstrated a 12.6% improvement of Root Mean Squared Error (from 0.5497 to 0.4802) and a 7.8% increase in the R^2 score (from 0.7530 to 0.8118), indicating that the proposed encoding better captures the cyclic nature of temporal patterns than traditional methods. The proposed methodology significantly improves prediction accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications in smart grid systems.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to assist in financial trend prediction by leveraging quantum resources for improved feature representation and learning. A custom Quantum Neural Network (QNN) regressor is introduced, designed with a novel ansatz tailored for financial applications. Two hybrid optimization strategies are proposed: (1) a sequential approach where classical recurrent models (RNN/LSTM) extract temporal dependencies before quantum processing, and (2) a joint learning framework that optimizes classical and quantum parameters simultaneously. Systematic evaluation using TimeSeriesSplit, k-fold cross-validation, and predictive error analysis highlights the ability of these hybrid models to integrate quantum computing into financial forecasting workflows. The findings demonstrate how quantum-assisted learning can contribute to financial modeling, offering insights into the practical role of quantum resources in time-series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages and 11 figures</p></details> |

While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Patient Behavior Monitoring and Suicide Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15221v1)** | 2025-03-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.15221v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their adoption in healthcare remains limited. While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of FMs for patient behavior monitoring through wearable devices remains underexplored. These datasets are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel FM based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), specifically designed to process real-world data from wearable devices. We demonstrate that our pretrained FM, trained on a broad cohort of psychiatric patients, performs downstream tasks via its latent representation without fine-tuning on a held-out cohort of suicidal patients. To illustrate this, we develop a probabilistic change-point detection algorithm for suicide detection and demonstrate the FM's effectiveness in predicting emotional states. Our results show that the discrete latent structure of the VQ-VAE outperforms a state-of-the-art Informer architecture in unsupervised suicide detection, while matching its performance in supervised emotion prediction when the latent dimensionality is increased, though at the cost of reduced unsupervised accuracy. This trade-off highlights the need for future FMs to integrate hybrid discrete-continuous structures for balanced performance across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (31 with appendices), 6 figures (13 with appendices); submitted to UAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sparseformer: a Transferable Transformer with Multi-granularity Token Sparsification for Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15578v1)** | 2025-03-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.15578v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series (MedTS) classification is crucial for improved diagnosis in healthcare, and yet it is challenging due to the varying granularity of patterns, intricate inter-channel correlation, information redundancy, and label scarcity. While existing transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, they mainly focus on forecasting and fail to fully exploit the distinctive characteristics of MedTS data. In this paper, we introduce Sparseformer, a transformer specifically designed for MedTS classification. We propose a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global modeling and token compression, allowing dynamic focus on the most informative tokens while distilling redundant features. This mechanism is then applied to the multi-granularity, cross-channel encoding of medical signals, capturing intra- and inter-granularity correlations and inter-channel connections. The sparsification design allows our model to handle heterogeneous inputs of varying lengths and channels directly. Further, we introduce an adaptive label encoder to address label space misalignment across datasets, equipping our model with cross-dataset transferability to alleviate the medical label scarcity issue. Our model outperforms 12 baselines across seven medical datasets under supervised learning. In the few-shot learning experiments, our model also achieves superior average results. In addition, the in-domain and cross-domain experiments among three diagnostic scenarios demonstrate our model's zero-shot learning capability. Collectively, these findings underscore the robustness and transferability of our model in various medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 16 pages, 5 tables</p></details> |

Our findings indicate that banana trees are highly effective with unbiased random data, outperforming state-of-the-art static algorithms in these scenarios.

In our approach, a diffusion-based time series forecasting model is used to probabilistically estimate the evolution of the system's stochastic components. These forecasts are then incorporated into MPC algorithms to estimate future trajectories and optimize action selection under the uncertainty of the future. We evaluate the framework on the task of energy arbitrage, where a Battery Energy Storage System participates in the day-ahead electricity market of the New York state. Experimental results indicate that our model-based approach with a diffusion-based forecaster significantly outperforms both implementations with classical forecasting methods and model-free reinforcement learning baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

Motivated by insights from the Topological Data Analysis (TDA) paradigm, of which real-world data exhibits multi-scale patterns, we construct several graphs using Persistent Homology Filtration -- a mathematical framework describing the multiscale structural properties of data points. Then, we use the constructed graphs as an input to create an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks. The ensemble aggregates the signals from the individual learners via an attention-based routing mechanism, thus systematically encoding the inherent multiscale structures of data. Four different real-world experiments on seismic activity prediction and traffic forecasting (PEMS-BAY, METR-LA) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms single-graph baselines while providing interpretable insights.</p></details> |  |

Theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signal. In non-sparse regimes, analyses have primarily focused on linear regression models with the design matrix having independent rows. In this paper, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal, as well as for minimum mean-square errors. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing VAMP algorithm and show that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p></details> |  |

Recent years, there are increasing interest of the data mining community to develop time series deep learning models to pursue better performance. The models performance often evaluate by certain evaluation metrics such as RMSE, Accuracy, and F1-score. Yet time series data are often hard to interpret and are collected with unknown environmental factors, sensor configuration, latent physic mechanisms, and non-stationary evolving behavior. As a result, a model that is better on standard metric-based evaluation may not always perform better in real-world tasks. In this blue sky paper, we aim to explore the challenge that exists in the metric-based evaluation framework for time series data mining and propose a potential blue-sky idea -- developing a knowledge-discovery-based evaluation framework, which aims to effectively utilize domain-expertise knowledge to evaluate a model. We demonstrate that an evidence-seeking explanation can potentially have stronger persuasive power than metric-based evaluation and obtain better generalization ability for time series data mining tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in SIAM SDM 2025 - Blue Sky Track (to appear)</p></details> |
| **[How Can Time Series Analysis Benefit From Multiple Modalities? A Survey and Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11835v2)** | 2025-03-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.11835v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data mining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits. We release an up-to-date GitHub repository that includes key papers and resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Repo: https://github.com/AdityaLab/MM4TSA</p></details> |
| **[On a Dissimilarity Metric for Analyzing Body Synergistic Coordination in Non-Periodic Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14821v1)** | 2025-03-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.14821v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a novel metric to quantitatively evaluate body synergistic coordination, explicitly addressing dynamic interactions between pairs of body segments in baseball pitching motions. Conventional methods typically compare motion trajectories using individual joint coordinates or velocities independently, employing techniques like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) that inherently apply temporal alignment even when such correction may distort meaningful rhythm-based differences. In contrast, our approach models the coordination dynamics as Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, leveraging convolution operations between pairs of time series data to capture the gain and phase-lag inherent in genuine coordination dynamics. Empirical validation demonstrates the robustness of the proposed metric to variations in camera angles and scaling, providing superior discriminative capability compared to DTW and deep learning-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Set Features for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14773v4)** | 2025-03-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2311.14773v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes to use set features for detecting anomalies in samples that consist of unusual combinations of normal elements. Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample. For example, state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches, first classify each element of the sample (e.g., image patch) as normal or anomalous and then classify the entire sample as anomalous if it contains anomalous elements. However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in image-level logical anomaly detection and sequence-level time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12245</p></details> |

This complexity, stemming from interactions among EVs, PV systems, customer behavior, and weather conditions, calls for a scalable framework to capture a full range of possible scenarios and analyze grid responses to factor in compound uncertainty. Although this process is challenging for many utilities today, the need to model numerous grid parameters as random variables and evaluate the impact on the system from many different perspectives will become increasingly essential to facilitate more strategic and well-informed planning investments. We present a scalable, stochastic-aware distribution system planning application that addresses these uncertainties by capturing spatial and temporal variability through a Markov model and conducting Monte Carlo simulations leveraging modular cloud-based architecture. The results demonstrate that 15,000 power flow scenarios generated from the Markov model are completed on the modified IEEE 123-bus test feeder, with each simulation representing an 8,760-hour time series run, all in under an hour. The grid impact extracted from this huge volume of simulated data provides insights into the spatial and temporal effects of adopted technology, highlighting that planning solely for average conditions is inadequate, while worst-case scenario planning may lead to prohibitive expenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures.

Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, large foundation models are able to preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors. We attribute this success to foundation models' ability to perform in-context learning and identify context parroting as a simple mechanism used by these models to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the potential of foundation models as a tool for probing nonlinear and complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13th ...</summary><p>13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

When analyzing time series, we often seek to understand the underlying events occurring in the measured environment. For example, one might ask: What caused a sharp drop in the stock price? Events are often described with natural language, so we conduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer natural language events from time series. We curate a new benchmark featuring win probabilities collected from 4,200 basketball and American football games, featuring 1.7M timesteps with real value data and corresponding natural language events. Building on the recent wave of using LLMs on time series, we evaluate 16 LLMs and find that they demonstrate promising abilities to infer events from time series data. The open-weights DeepSeek-R1 32B model outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o. Despite this impressive initial performance, we also find clear avenues to improve recent models, as we identify failures when altering the provided context, event sequence lengths, and evaluation strategy.

These non-auto-regressive approaches involving different generative methods, including GAN, Diffusion, and Flow Matching for time series, have empirically demonstrated high-quality generation capability and accuracy. However, we still lack an appropriate understanding of how it processes approximation and generalization. This paper presents the first theoretical framework from the perspective of flow-based generative models to relieve the knowledge of limitations. In particular, we provide our insights with strict guarantees from three perspectives: $\textbf{Approximation}$, $\textbf{Generalization}$ and $\textbf{Efficiency}$. In detail, our analysis achieves the contributions as follows: $\bullet$ By assuming a general data model, the fitting of the flow-based generative models is confirmed to converge to arbitrary error under the universal approximation of Diffusion Transformer (DiT). $\bullet$ Introducing a polynomial-based regularization for flow matching, the generalization error thus be bounded since the generalization of polynomial approximation. $\bullet$ The sampling for generation is considered as an optimization process, we demonstrate its fast convergence with updating standard first-order gradient descent of some objective.</p></details> | 33 pages |

In this paper we initiate the application of QML to LTSF problems by proposing QuLTSF, a simple hybrid QML model for multivariate LTSF.

However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

This study introduces a novel deep learning framework that advances time series forecasting for infectious diseases, with its application to COVID 19 data as a critical case study. Our hybrid approach integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to capture spatial and temporal dynamics of disease transmission across diverse regions. The CNN extracts spatial features from raw epidemiological data, while the LSTM models temporal patterns, yielding precise and adaptable predictions. To maximize performance, we employ a hybrid optimization strategy combining the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) to fine tune hyperparameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and training epochs enhancing model efficiency and accuracy. Applied to COVID 19 case data from 24 countries across six continents, our method outperforms established benchmarks, including ARIMA and standalone LSTM models, with statistically significant gains in predictive accuracy (e.g., reduced RMSE). This framework demonstrates its potential as a versatile method for forecasting epidemic trends, offering insights for resource planning and decision making in both historical contexts, like the COVID 19 pandemic, and future outbreaks.</p></details> |  |

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an invaluable tool for disturbance mapping, providing consistent time-series images of the ground regardless of weather or illumination conditions. Despite SAR's potential for disturbance mapping, processing SAR data to an analysis-ready format requires expertise and significant compute resources, particularly for large-scale global analysis. In October 2023, NASA's Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project released the near-global Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR backscatter from Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1) dataset, providing publicly available, analysis-ready SAR imagery. In this work, we utilize this new dataset to systematically analyze land surface disturbances. As labeling SAR data is often prohibitively time-consuming, we train a self-supervised vision transformer - which requires no labels to train - on OPERA RTC-S1 data to estimate a per-pixel distribution from the set of baseline imagery and assess disturbances when there is significant deviation from the modeled distribution. To test our model's capability and generality, we evaluate three different natural disasters - which represent high-intensity, abrupt disturbances - from three different regions of the world. Across events, our approach yields high quality delineations: F1 scores exceeding 0.6 and Areas Under the Precision-Recall Curve exceeding 0.65, consistently outperforming existing SAR disturbance methods. Our findings suggest that a self-supervised vision transformer is well-suited for global disturbance mapping and can be a valuable tool for operational, near-global disturbance monitoring, particularly when labeled data does not exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures, 5 tables.

However, effective analysis of multi-modal time series is hindered by data heterogeneity, modality gap, misalignment, and inherent noise. Recent advancements in multi-modal time series methods have exploited the multi-modal context via cross-modal interactions based on deep learning methods, significantly enhancing various downstream tasks. In this tutorial and survey, we present a systematic and up-to-date overview of multi-modal time series datasets and methods. We first state the existing challenges of multi-modal time series analysis and our motivations, with a brief introduction of preliminaries. Then, we summarize the general pipeline and categorize existing methods through a unified cross-modal interaction framework encompassing fusion, alignment, and transference at different levels (\textit{i.e.}, input, intermediate, output), where key concepts and ideas are highlighted. We also discuss the real-world applications of multi-modal analysis for both standard and spatial time series, tailored to general and specific domains. Finally, we discuss future research directions to help practitioners explore and exploit multi-modal time series.

We address key challenges in scaling models with neural time-series data, namely, sparse and variable electrode distribution across subjects and datasets. The Population Transformer (PopT) stacks on top of pretrained temporal embeddings and enhances downstream decoding by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. The pretrained PopT lowers the amount of data required for downstream decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on held-out subjects and tasks. Compared to end-to-end methods, this approach is computationally lightweight, while achieving similar or better decoding performance. We further show how our framework is generalizable to multiple time-series embeddings and neural data modalities. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained and fine-tuned PopT models to show how they can be used to extract neuroscience insights from large amounts of data. We release our code as well as a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability.

While various approaches for TSC have been explored, important properties of time series, such as shift equivariance and inversion invariance, are largely underexplored by existing works. To fill this gap, we propose a novel multi-view approach to capture patterns with properties like shift equivariance. Our method integrates diverse features, including spectral, temporal, local, and global features, to obtain rich, complementary contexts for TSC. We use continuous wavelet transform to capture time-frequency features that remain consistent even when the input is shifted in time. These features are fused with temporal convolutional or multilayer perceptron features to provide complex local and global contextual information. We utilize the Mamba state space model for efficient and scalable sequence modeling and capturing long-range dependencies in time series. Moreover, we introduce a new scanning scheme for Mamba, called tango scanning, to effectively model sequence relationships and leverage inversion invariance, thereby enhancing our model's generalization and robustness. Experiments on two sets of benchmark datasets (10+20 datasets) demonstrate our approach's effectiveness, achieving average accuracy improvements of 4.01-6.45\% and 7.93\% respectively, over leading TSC models such as TimesNet and TSLANet.</p></details> |  |

It shifts the focus from data fidelity to goal-oriented or task-oriented semantic transmission. While deep learning-based methods are commonly used for semantic encoding and decoding, they struggle with the sequential nature of time series data and high computation cost, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. Data compression plays a crucial role in reducing transmission and storage costs, yet traditional data compression methods fall short of the demands of goal-oriented communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct analytics on time series data compressed by the SHRINK compression algorithm. Through experimentation using outlier detection as a case study, we show that our method outperforms baselines running on uncompressed data in multiple cases, with merely 1% difference in the worst case. Additionally, it achieves four times lower runtime on average and accesses approximately 10% of the data volume, which enables edge analytics with limited storage and computation power. These results demonstrate that our approach offers reliable, high-speed outlier detection analytics for diverse IoT applications while extracting semantics from time-series data, achieving high compression, and reducing data transmission.</p></details> |  |

Despite their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs remain underutilized for motion sensor data due to the lack of semantic context in time-series, computational constraints, and challenges in processing numerical inputs. SensorLLM addresses these limitations through a Sensor-Language Alignment stage, where we introduce special tokens for each sensor channel and automatically generate textual trend descriptions. This alignment enables LLMs to capture numerical variations, channel-specific features, and data of varying duration--without requiring human annotations. In the subsequent Task-Aware Tuning stage, we refine the model for HAR classification, achieving performance that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that SensorLLM evolves into an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier through Sensor-Language Alignment, generalizing across diverse HAR datasets. We believe this work establishes a foundation for future research on time-series and text alignment, paving the way for foundation models in sensor data analysis.</p></details> |  |

This class of methods appears to be of interest for modeling dynamical systems, either through direct long-term prediction of the evolution of the state or as a powerful embedding for downstream methods. In particular, a recent line of work has developed invertible Koopman autoencoders (IKAEs), which provide an exact reconstruction of the input state thanks to their analytically invertible encoder, based on coupling layer normalizing flow models. We identify that the conservation of the dimension imposed by the normalizing flows is a limitation for the IKAE models, and thus we propose to augment the latent state with a second, non-invertible encoder network. This results in our new model: the Augmented Invertible Koopman AutoEncoder (AIKAE). We demonstrate the relevance of the AIKAE through a series of long-term time series forecasting experiments, on satellite image time series as well as on a benchmark involving predictions based on a large lookback window of observations.</p></details> |  |

Remote sensing based forest health monitoring, oftentimes, relies on supervised machine learning algorithms that require labeled training data. Monitoring temporal patterns through time series analysis offers a potential alternative for earlier detection of disturbance but requires substantial storage resources. This study investigates the potential of a Deep Learning algorithm based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder for the detection of anomalies in forest health (e.g. bark beetle outbreaks), utilizing Sentinel-2 time series data. This approach is an alternative to supervised machine learning methods, avoiding the necessity for labeled training data. Furthermore, it is more memory-efficient than other time series analysis approaches, as a robust model can be created using only a 26-week-long time series as input. In this study, we monitored pure stands of spruce in Thuringia, Germany, over a 7-year period from 2018 to the end of 2024. Our best model achieved a detection accuracy of 87% on test data and was able to detect 61% of all anomalies at a very early stage (more than a month before visible signs of forest degradation). Compared to another widely used time series break detection algorithm - BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend), our approach consistently detected higher percentage of anomalies at an earlier stage. These findings suggest that LSTM-based Autoencoders could provide a promising, resource-efficient approach to forest health monitoring, enabling more timely responses to emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 18 figures, submitted to IEEE: Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

However, the high-dimensional spatial-temporal dynamics of turbulent flames typically pose considerable challenges to mode recognition. Based on the bidirectional temporal and nonlinear dimensionality reduction models, this study introduces a two-layer bidirectional long short-term memory variational autoencoder, Bi-LSTM-VAE model, to effectively recognize dynamical modes in annular combustion systems. Specifically, leveraging 16 pressure signals from a swirl-stabilized annular combustor, the model maps complex dynamics into a low-dimensional latent space while preserving temporal dependency and nonlinear behavior features through the recurrent neural network structure. The results show that the novel Bi-LSTM-VAE method enables a clear representation of combustion states in two-dimensional state space. Analysis of latent variable distributions reveals distinct patterns corresponding to a wide range of equivalence ratios and premixed fuel and air mass flow rates, offering novel insights into mode classification and transitions, highlighting this model's potential for deciphering complex thermoacoustic phenomena.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Traditional methods for RUL prediction often struggle with issues such as data sparsity, varying battery chemistries, and the inability to capture complex degradation patterns over time. In this study, we propose a survival analysis-based framework combined with deep learning models to predict the RUL of lithium-ion batteries. Specifically, we utilize five advanced models: the Cox-type models (Cox, CoxPH, and CoxTime) and two machine-learning-based models (DeepHit and MTLR). These models address the challenges of accurate RUL estimation by transforming raw time-series battery data into survival data, including key degradation indicators such as voltage, current, and internal resistance. Advanced feature extraction techniques enhance the model's robustness in diverse real-world scenarios, including varying charging conditions and battery chemistries. Our models are tested using 10-fold cross-validation, ensuring generalizability and minimizing overfitting. Experimental results show that our survival-based framework significantly improves RUL prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods, providing a reliable tool for battery management and maintenance optimization. This study contributes to the advancement of predictive maintenance in battery technology, offering valuable insights for both researchers and industry practitioners aiming to enhance the operational lifespan of lithium-ion batteries.</p></details> |  |

Industrial data exhibit characteristics such as multi-source heterogeneity, nonlinearity, strong coupling, and temporal interactions, while also being affected by noise interference. These complexities make it challenging for traditional anomaly detection methods to extract key features, impacting detection accuracy and stability. Traditional machine learning approaches often struggle with such complex data due to limitations in processing capacity and generalisation ability, making them inadequate for practical applications. While deep learning feature extraction modules have demonstrated remarkable performance in image and text processing, they remain ineffective when applied to multi-source heterogeneous industrial data lacking explicit correlations. Moreover, existing multi-source heterogeneous data processing techniques still rely on dimensionality reduction and feature selection, which can lead to information loss and difficulty in capturing high-order interactions. To address these challenges, this study applies the EAPCR and Time-EAPCR models proposed in previous research and introduces a new model, Time-EAPCR-T, where Transformer replaces the LSTM module in the time-series processing component of Time-EAPCR. This modification effectively addresses multi-source data heterogeneity, facilitates efficient multi-source feature fusion, and enhances the temporal feature extraction capabilities of multi-source industrial data.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across four industrial datasets, highlighting its broad application potential.</p></details> |  |

Besides traditional methods that operate in the time domain, many recent models transform time series data into the frequency domain to better capture complex patterns. However, these methods often use filtering techniques to remove certain frequency signals as noise, which may unintentionally discard important information and reduce prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose the Frequency Decomposition Mixture-of-Experts (FreqMoE) model, which dynamically decomposes time series data into frequency bands, each processed by a specialized expert. A gating mechanism adjusts the importance of each output of expert based on frequency characteristics, and the aggregated results are fed into a prediction module that iteratively refines the forecast using residual connections. Our experiments demonstrate that FreqMoE outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving the best performance on 51 out of 70 metrics across all tested datasets, while significantly reducing the number of required parameters to under 50k, providing notable efficiency advantages.

In this setting, multiple labels are recorded over time while being corrupted by a time-dependent noise function. We first demonstrate the importance of modeling the temporal nature of the label noise function and how existing methods will consistently underperform.

Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is challenging due to the algorithm's complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications.

The performance of state-of-the-art capacity prediction methods is significantly hindered by the limited availability of training data, primarily attributed to the expensive experimentation and data sharing restrictions. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a recurrent conditional generative adversarial network (RCGAN) scheme to enrich the limited battery data by adding high-fidelity synthetic ones to improve the capacity prediction. The proposed RCGAN scheme consists of a generator network to generate synthetic samples that closely resemble the true data and a discriminator network to differentiate real and synthetic samples. Long shortterm memory (LSTM)-based generator and discriminator are leveraged to learn the temporal and spatial distributions in the multivariate time-series battery data. Moreover, the generator is conditioned on the capacity value to account for changes in battery dynamics due to the degradation over usage cycles. The effectiveness of the RCGAN is evaluated across six batteries from two benchmark datasets (NASA and MIT). The raw data is then augmented with synthetic samples from the RCGAN to train LSTM and gate recurrent unit (GRU) models for capacity prediction. Simulation results show that the models trained with augmented datasets significantly outperform those trained with the original datasets in capacity prediction.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

Conventional models primarily employ long-only mechanisms, excluding highly correlated assets to diversify risk. However, incorporating short-selling enables low-risk arbitrage through hedging correlated assets. This paper constructs a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) portfolio management framework with short-selling mechanisms conforming to actual trading rules, exploring strategies for excess returns in China's A-share market. Key innovations include: (1) Development of a comprehensive short-selling mechanism in continuous trading that accounts for dynamic evolution of transactions across time periods; (2) Design of a long-short optimization framework integrating deep neural networks for processing multi-dimensional financial time series with mean Sharpe ratio reward functions. Empirical results show the DRL model with short-selling demonstrates significant optimization capabilities, achieving consistent positive returns during backtesting periods. Compared to traditional approaches, this model delivers superior risk-adjusted returns while reducing maximum drawdown. From an allocation perspective, the DRL model establishes a robust investment style, enhancing defensive capabilities through strategic avoidance of underperforming assets and balanced capital allocation. This research contributes to portfolio theory while providing novel methodologies for quantitative investment practice.</p></details> |  |

The advantages of FT, such as high efficiency and a global view, have been rapidly explored and exploited in various time series tasks and applications, demonstrating the promising potential of FT as a new deep learning paradigm for time series analysis. Despite the growing attention and the proliferation of research in this emerging field, there is currently a lack of a systematic review and in-depth analysis of deep learning-based time series models with FT. It is also unclear why FT can enhance time series analysis and what its limitations are in the field. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive review that systematically investigates and summarizes the recent research advancements in deep learning-based time series analysis with FT. Specifically, we explore the primary approaches used in current models that incorporate FT, the types of neural networks that leverage FT, and the representative FT-equipped models in deep time series analysis. We propose a novel taxonomy to categorize the existing methods in this field, providing a structured overview of the diverse approaches employed in incorporating FT into deep learning models for time series analysis. Finally, we highlight the advantages and limitations of FT for time series modeling and identify potential future research directions that can further contribute to the community of time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

For example, in retail, covariates may indicate promotions or peak dates such as holiday seasons that heavily influence demand forecasts. Recent advances in pretraining large language model architectures for time series forecasting have led to highly accurate forecasters. However, the majority of these models do not readily use covariates as they are often specific to a certain task or domain. This paper introduces a new method to incorporate covariates into pretrained time series forecasting models. Our proposed approach incorporates covariate information into pretrained forecasting models through modular blocks that inject past and future covariate information, without necessarily modifying the pretrained model in consideration. In order to evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark composed of 32 different synthetic datasets with varying dynamics to evaluate the effectivity of forecasting models with covariates. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets show that our approach effectively incorporates covariate information into pretrained models, outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2025</p></details> |

Recent state-of-the-art works ignore the inter-relations between variates, using their model on each variate independently. This raises several research questions related to proper modeling of multivariate data. In this work, we propose to view multivariate forecasting as a multi-task learning problem, facilitating the analysis of forecasting by considering the angle between task gradients and their balance. To do so, we analyze linear models to characterize the behavior of tasks. Our analysis suggests that tasks can be defined by grouping similar variates together, which we achieve via a simple clustering that depends on correlation-based similarities. Moreover, to balance tasks, we scale gradients with respect to their prediction error. Then, each task is solved with a linear model within our MTLinear framework. We evaluate our approach on challenging benchmarks in comparison to strong baselines, and we show it obtains on-par or better results on multivariate forecasting problems.

Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions.

In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly enhanced the performance of TSC models in these critical domains. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers can covertly implant triggers into models to induce malicious outcomes. Existing backdoor attacks targeting DNN-based TSC models remain elementary. In particular, early methods borrow trigger designs from computer vision, which are ineffective for time series data. More recent approaches utilize generative models for trigger generation, but at the cost of significant computational complexity. In this work, we analyze the limitations of existing attacks and introduce an enhanced method, FreqBack. Drawing inspiration from the fact that DNN models inherently capture frequency domain features in time series data, we identify that improper perturbations in the frequency domain are the root cause of ineffective attacks. To address this, we propose to generate triggers both effectively and efficiently, guided by frequency analysis. FreqBack exhibits substantial performance across five models and eight datasets, achieving an impressive attack success rate of over 90%, while maintaining less than a 3% drop in model accuracy on clean data.</p></details> | WWW 2025 (Oral) |

Understanding the stability of a synchronized phenomenon is crucial for ensuring functionality in various complex systems. The stability of the synchronization phenomenon is extensively studied using the Master Stability Function (MSF). This powerful and elegant tool plays a pivotal role in determining the stability of synchronization states, providing deep insights into synchronization in coupled systems. Although MSF analysis has been used for 25 years to study the stability of synchronization states, a systematic investigation of MSF across various networked systems remains missing from the literature. In this article, we present a simplified and unified MSF analysis for diverse undirected and directed networked systems. We begin with the analytical MSF framework for pairwise-coupled identical systems with diffusive and natural coupling schemes and extend our analysis to directed networks and multilayer networks, considering both intra-layer and inter-layer interactions. Furthermore, we revisit the MSF framework to incorporate higher-order interactions alongside pairwise interactions. To enhance understanding, we also provide a numerical analysis of synchronization in coupled R\"ossler systems under pairwise diffusive coupling and propose algorithms for determining the MSF, identifying stability regimes, and classifying MSF functions. Overall, the primary goal of this review is to present a systematic study of MSF in coupled dynamical networks in a clear and structured manner, making this powerful tool more accessible. Furthermore, we highlight cases where the study of synchronization states using MSF remains underexplored. Additionally, we discuss recent research focusing on MSF analysis using time series data and machine learning approaches.</p></details> | 49 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets.

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making.

In the preprocessing phase, we transform the original data to achieve a unified structure and mitigate the effect of possible outliers. Further, to address the challenge of high dimensionality, we test three dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, kPCA, UMAP). Finally, we predict supply and demand curves, once represented in a latent space, with a variety of machine learning methods (RF, LSTM, TSMixer). As our results on the MIBEL dataset show, a high dimensional structure of the market curves can be best handled by the nonlinear reduction technique UMAP. Regardless of the ML technique used for prediction, we achieved the lowest values for all considered precision metrics with a UMAP latent space representation in only two or three dimensions, even when compared to PCA and kPCA with five or six dimensions. Further, we demonstrate that the most promising machine learning technique to handle the complex structure of the electricity market curves is a novel TSMixer architecture. Finally, we fill the gap in the field of electricity market curves prediction literature: in addition to standard analysis on the supply side, we applied the ML framework and predicted demand curves too.

Such data streams, however, are vulnerable to anomalies that signal crucial problems like system failures or security incidents. Traditional MVTS anomaly detection methods, encompassing statistical and centralized machine learning approaches, struggle with the heterogeneity, variability, and privacy concerns of large-scale, distributed environments. In response, we introduce FedKO, a novel unsupervised Federated Learning framework that leverages the linear predictive capabilities of Koopman operator theory along with the dynamic adaptability of Reservoir Computing. This enables effective spatiotemporal processing and privacy preservation for MVTS data. FedKO is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, utilizing a specific federated algorithm to explore a shared Reservoir-Koopman model across diverse datasets. Such a model is then deployable on edge devices for efficient detection of anomalies in local MVTS streams. Experimental results across various datasets showcase FedKO's superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in MVTS anomaly detection. Moreover, FedKO reduces up to 8x communication size and 2x memory usage, making it highly suitable for large-scale systems.</p></details> | Accepted at SDM 2025 |

In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Few dedicated UniDA methods exist for Time Series (TS), which remains a challenging case. In general, UniDA approaches align common class samples and detect unknown target samples from emerging classes. Such detection often results from thresholding a discriminability metric. The threshold value is typically either a fine-tuned hyperparameter or a fixed value, which limits the ability of the model to adapt to new data. Furthermore, discriminability metrics exhibit overconfidence for unknown samples, leading to misclassifications. This paper introduces UniJDOT, an optimal-transport-based method that accounts for the unknown target samples in the transport cost. Our method also proposes a joint decision space to improve the discriminability of the detection module. In addition, we use an auto-thresholding algorithm to reduce the dependence on fixed or fine-tuned thresholds. Finally, we rely on a Fourier transform-based layer inspired by the Fourier Neural Operator for better TS representation. Experiments on TS benchmarks demonstrate the discriminability, robustness, and state-of-the-art performance of UniJDOT.</p></details> |  |

Previous works in wireless respiration monitoring have primarily focused on estimating respiration rate, where the breath waveforms are often generated as a by-product. As a result, issues such as waveform deformation and inversion have largely been overlooked, reducing the signal's utility for applications requiring breathing waveforms. To address this problem, we present a novel approach, MobiVital, that improves the quality of respiration waveforms obtained from ultra-wideband (UWB) radar data. MobiVital combines a self-supervised autoregressive model for breathing waveform extraction with a biology-informed algorithm to detect and correct waveform inversions. To encourage reproducible research efforts for developing wireless vital signal monitoring systems, we also release a 12-person, 24-hour UWB radar vital signal dataset, with time-synchronized ground truth obtained from wearable sensors. Our results show that the respiration waveforms produced by our system exhibit a 7-34% increase in fidelity to the ground truth compared to the baselines and can benefit downstream tasks such as respiration rate estimation.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%-30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to PID controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

With the advancement of foundation models, such as the emergence of large language models (LLMs), a wide range of reasoning strategies has been proposed, including test-time enhancements, such as Chain-ofThought, and post-training optimizations, as used in DeepSeek-R1. While these reasoning strategies have demonstrated effectiveness across various challenging language or vision tasks, their applicability and impact on time-series forecasting (TSF), particularly the challenging zero-shot TSF, remain largely unexplored. In particular, it is unclear whether zero-shot TSF benefits from reasoning and, if so, what types of reasoning strategies are most effective. To bridge this gap, we propose ReC4TS, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of popular reasoning strategies when applied to zero-shot TSF tasks. ReC4TS conducts comprehensive evaluations across datasets spanning eight domains, covering both unimodal and multimodal with short-term and longterm forecasting tasks. More importantly, ReC4TS provides key insights: (1) Self-consistency emerges as the most effective test-time reasoning strategy; (2) Group-relative policy optimization emerges as a more suitable approach for incentivizing reasoning ability during post-training; (3) Multimodal TSF benefits more from reasoning strategies compared to unimodal TSF. Beyond these insights, ReC4TS establishes two pioneering starting blocks to support future zero-shot TSF reasoning research: (1) A novel dataset, TimeThinking, containing forecasting samples annotated with reasoning trajectories from multiple advanced LLMs, and (2) A new and simple test-time scaling-law validated on foundational TSF models enabled by self-consistency reasoning strategy.

The practical applications often involve analyzing time-series data alongside contextual information in the form of natural language to support informed decisions. However, current time-series models are limited in their ability to perform reasoning that involves both time-series and their textual content. In this work, we address this gap by introducing \textit{Chat-TS}, a large language model (LLM) based framework, designed to support reasoning over time series and textual data. Unlike traditional models, Chat-TS integrates time-series tokens into LLMs' vocabulary, enhancing its reasoning ability over both modalities without compromising the core natural language capabilities, enabling practical analysis and reasoning across modalities. To support learning and evaluation in this setup, we contribute new datasets: the \textit{TS Instruct Training Dataset} which pairs diverse time-series data with relevant text instructions and responses for instruction tuning, the \textit{TS Instruct Question and Answer (QA) Gold Dataset} which provides multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning, and a \textit{TS Instruct Quantitative Probing Set} which contains a small subset of the TS Instruct QA tasks alongside math and decision-making questions for LLM evaluation. We designed a training strategy to preserve the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs while augmenting them for time-series reasoning. Experiments show that Chat-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal reasoning tasks by maintaining strong natural language proficiency while improving time-series reasoning. ~\footnote{To ensure replicability and facilitate future research, all models, datasets, and code will be available at [\texttt{Github-URL}].}</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba time series forecasting with uncertainty propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10873v1)** | 2025-03-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.10873v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models, such as Mamba, have recently garnered attention in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequence patterns. However, in electricity consumption benchmarks, Mamba forecasts exhibit a mean error of approximately 8\%. Similarly, in traffic occupancy benchmarks, the mean error reaches 18\%. This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\% of the time. We end with a consideration of potential limitations, adjustments to improve performance, and considerations for applying this framework to processes for purely or largely stochastic dynamics where the stochastic changes accumulate, as observed for example in pure Brownian motion or molecular dynamics trajectories.</p></details> |  |

In such systems, three key challenges must be overcome for accurate and scalable predictions: 1) emergence of new entities, 2) disappearance of existing entities, and 3) the large number of entities present in the data. The recently proposed Inverted Transformer (iTransformer) architecture has shown promising results by effectively handling variable entities. However, its practical application in large-scale settings is limited by quadratic time and space complexity ($O(N^2)$) with respect to the number of entities $N$. In this paper, we introduce EiFormer, an improved inverted transformer architecture that maintains the adaptive capabilities of iTransformer while reducing computational complexity to linear scale ($O(N)$). Our key innovation lies in restructuring the attention mechanism to eliminate redundant computations without sacrificing model expressiveness. Additionally, we incorporate a random projection mechanism that not only enhances efficiency but also improves prediction accuracy through better feature representation. Extensive experiments on the public LargeST benchmark dataset and a proprietary large-scale time series dataset demonstrate that EiFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in both computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy. Our approach enables practical deployment of transformer-based forecasting in industrial applications where handling time series at scale is essential.</p></details> | 10 pages |

This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of evaluation methodologies for these increasingly capable agents. We systematically analyze evaluation benchmarks and frameworks across four critical dimensions: (1) fundamental agent capabilities, including planning, tool use, self-reflection, and memory; (2) application-specific benchmarks for web, software engineering, scientific, and conversational agents; (3) benchmarks for generalist agents; and (4) frameworks for evaluating agents. Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including a shift toward more realistic, challenging evaluations with continuously updated benchmarks. We also identify critical gaps that future research must address-particularly in assessing cost-efficiency, safety, and robustness, and in developing fine-grained, and scalable evaluation methods. This survey maps the rapidly evolving landscape of agent evaluation, reveals the emerging trends in the field, identifies current limitations, and proposes directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

This benchmark addresses the gap in current evaluations that often overlook the ability of models to comprehend and produce code constrained by computational complexity. BigO(Bench) includes tooling to infer the algorithmic complexity of any Python function from profiling measurements, including human- or LLM-generated solutions. BigO(Bench) also includes of set of 3,105 coding problems and 1,190,250 solutions from Code Contests annotated with inferred (synthetic) time and space complexity labels from the complexity framework, as well as corresponding runtime and memory footprint values for a large set of input sizes. We present results from evaluating multiple state-of-the-art language models on this benchmark, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling complexity requirements. In particular, token-space reasoning models are unrivaled in code generation but not in complexity understanding, hinting that they may not generalize well to tasks for which no reward was given at training time.</p></details> |  |

A Rigorous Examination of Mitigation Strategies for LLM Benchmark Data Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16402v1)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.16402v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC)-the inclusion of benchmark testing samples in the training set-has raised increasing concerns in Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, leading to falsely inflated performance estimates and undermining evaluation reliability. To address this, researchers have proposed various mitigation strategies to update existing benchmarks, including modifying original questions or generating new ones based on them. However, a rigorous examination of the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies remains lacking. In this paper, we design a systematic and controlled pipeline along with two novel metrics-fidelity and contamination resistance-to provide a fine-grained and comprehensive assessment of existing BDC mitigation strategies. Previous assessment methods, such as accuracy drop and accuracy matching, focus solely on aggregate accuracy, often leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions. Our metrics address this limitation by emphasizing question-level evaluation result matching. Extensive experiments with 10 LLMs, 5 benchmarks, 20 BDC mitigation strategies, and 2 contamination scenarios reveal that no existing strategy significantly improves resistance over the vanilla case (i.e., no benchmark update) across all benchmarks, and none effectively balances fidelity and contamination resistance. These findings underscore the urgent need for designing more effective BDC mitigation strategies.

Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372v5)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.12372v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, VLDB 2025</p></details> |

In light of this, we hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBRACES, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates. By optimizing sub-update contributions, LLMBRACES refines the prediction process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, much like a 'brace' providing support and stability. Moreover, LLMBRACES can be extended to support conditional control over generation characteristics, such as sentiment, thereby offering fine-grained steering of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments on various LLMs-including Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama2-7B, and Llama3-8B-demonstrate that LLMBRACES outperforms baseline approaches in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings while requiring significantly fewer tunable parameters, up to 75% fewer compared to LoRA. Furthermore, LLMBRACES excels in sentiment-controlled generation and toxicity reduction, highlighting its potential for flexible, controlled text generation across applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |

In this work, we introduce and evaluate perceptual harm, a term for the harm caused to users when others perceive or suspect them of using AI. We examined perceptual harms in three online experiments, each of which entailed human participants evaluating the profiles for fictional freelance writers. We asked participants whether they suspected the freelancers of using AI, the quality of their writing, and whether they should be hired. We found some support for perceptual harms against for certain demographic groups, but that perceptions of AI use negatively impacted writing evaluations and hiring outcomes across the board.</p></details> |  |

We conduct formative interviews with 12 health professionals and 10 potential coaching recipients to develop design principles for an LLM-based health coach. We then built GPTCoach, a chatbot that implements the onboarding conversation from an evidence-based coaching program, uses conversational strategies from motivational interviewing, and incorporates wearable data to create personalized physical activity plans. In a lab study with 16 participants using three months of historical data, we find promising evidence that GPTCoach gathers rich qualitative information to offer personalized support, with users feeling comfortable sharing concerns.

Defending against such attacks remains challenging due to the opacity of jailbreaking mechanisms and the high computational cost of training LLMs robustly. We demonstrate that adversarial attacks share a universal mechanism for circumventing LLM safeguards that works by ablating a dimension in the residual stream embedding space called the refusal feature. We further show that the operation of refusal feature ablation (RFA) approximates the worst-case perturbation of offsetting model safety. Based on these findings, we propose Refusal Feature Adversarial Training (ReFAT), a novel algorithm that efficiently performs LLM adversarial training by simulating the effect of input-level attacks via RFA. Experiment results show that ReFAT significantly improves the robustness of three popular LLMs against a wide range of adversarial attacks, with considerably less computational overhead compared to existing adversarial training methods.</p></details> |  |

Our study investigates the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning in small LLMs, focusing on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, under strict constraints: training on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. Adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and curating a compact, high-quality mathematical reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to explore model behavior and performance. Our results demonstrate rapid reasoning gains - e.g., AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, surpassing o1-preview - using only 7,000 samples and a $42 training cost, compared to thousands of dollars for baseline models. However, challenges such as optimization instability and length constraints emerged with prolonged training. These findings highlight the efficacy of RL-based fine-tuning for small LLMs, offering a cost-effective alternative to large-scale approaches. We release our code and datasets as open-source resources, providing insights into trade-offs and laying a foundation for scalable, reasoning-capable LLMs in resource-limited environments.

While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications-such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations-which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, \textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/QizhiPei/mathfusion.</p></details> | Work in progress |

While increasing parameter counts improves accuracy, it also broadens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a hardware-aware framework that accelerates the inference of LLMs while preserving their capabilities. Using neural architecture search (NAS) at a large-scale, Puzzle optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization. We showcase our framework's impact via Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B), a publicly available model derived from Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. Nemotron-51B achieves a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while retaining 98.4% of the original model's benchmark accuracies. Notably, it is the most accurate model supporting single H100 GPU inference with large batch sizes, despite training on only 45B tokens, far fewer than the 15T used to train Llama-70B. Lastly, we derive Llama-3.3-Nemotron-49B-Super-Base to demonstrate Puzzle can retain long-context and that lightweight alignment on these derived models allows them to surpass the parent model in specific capabilities. Our work establishes that powerful LLM models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible loss in quality, underscoring that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection.</p></details> |  |

Existing KV cache compression methods include eviction, merging, or quantization of the KV cache to reduce its size. However, compression results in irreversible information forgetting, potentially affecting the accuracy of subsequent decoding. In this paper, we propose SpeCache, which takes full advantage of the large and easily expandable CPU memory to offload the complete KV cache, and dynamically fetches KV pairs back in each decoding step based on their importance measured by low-bit KV cache copy in VRAM. To avoid inference latency caused by CPU-GPU communication, SpeCache speculatively predicts the KV pairs that the next token might attend to, allowing us to prefetch them before the next decoding step which enables parallelization of prefetching and computation. Experiments on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks verify that SpeCache effectively reduces VRAM usage while avoiding information forgetting for long sequences without re-training, even with a 10x high KV cache compression ratio.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces PolyTest, a novel approach that enhances test generation by exploiting polyglot and temperature-controlled diversity. PolyTest systematically leverages these properties in two complementary ways: (1) Cross-lingual test generation, where tests are generated in multiple languages at zero temperature and then unified; (2) Diverse test sampling, where multiple test sets are generated within the same language at a higher temperature before unification. A key insight is that LLMs can generate diverse yet contradicting tests -- same input, different expected outputs -- across languages and generations. PolyTest mitigates inconsistencies by unifying test sets, fostering self-consistency and improving overall test quality. Unlike single-language or single-attempt approaches, PolyTest enhances testing without requiring on-the-fly execution, making it particularly beneficial for weaker-performing languages. We evaluate PolyTest on Llama3-70B, GPT-4o, and GPT-3.5 using EvalPlus, generating tests in five languages (Java, C, Python, JavaScript, and a CSV-based format) at temperature 0 and sampling multiple sets at temperature 1. We observe that LLMs frequently generate contradicting tests across settings, and that PolyTest significantly improves test quality across all considered metrics -- number of tests, passing rate, statement/branch coverage (up to +9.01%), and mutation score (up to +11.23%). Finally, PolyTest outperforms Pynguin in test generation, passing rate, and mutation score.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.</p></details> |  |

While these models have shown impressive performance on general language tasks, their effectiveness in specialized fields like legal remains unclear. To address this, we present a preliminary evaluation of LLMs in various legal scenarios, covering both Chinese and English legal tasks. Our analysis includes 9 LLMs and 17 legal tasks, with a focus on newly published and more complex challenges such as multi-defendant legal judgments and legal argument reasoning. Our findings indicate that, despite DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 being among the most powerful models, their legal reasoning capabilities are still lacking. Specifically, these models score below 80\% on seven Chinese legal reasoning tasks and below 80\% on two English legal reasoning tasks. This suggests that, even among the most advanced reasoning models, legal reasoning abilities remain underdeveloped.</p></details> |  |

While numerical reward signals and verifiers can effectively rank candidate actions, they often provide limited contextual guidance. In contrast, natural language feedback better aligns with the generative capabilities of LLMs, providing richer and more actionable suggestions. However, parsing and implementing this feedback effectively can be challenging for LLM-based agents. In this work, we introduce Critique-Guided Improvement (CGI), a novel two-player framework, comprising an actor model that explores an environment and a critic model that generates detailed nature language feedback. By training the critic to produce fine-grained assessments and actionable revisions, and the actor to utilize these critiques, our approach promotes more robust exploration of alternative strategies while avoiding local optima. Experiments in three interactive environments show that CGI outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, even a small critic model surpasses GPT-4 in feedback quality. The resulting actor achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the power of explicit iterative guidance to enhance decision-making in LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |

By replacing the core-layer electrical packet switches by optical circuit switches, \emph{LumosCore} could achieves $2\times$ increase in bandwidth or $8\times$ increase in network size. We offer the detailed design of \emph{LumosCore} at both deployment stage and running stage. At deployment stage, we propose Interleaved Wiring, which is compatible with all possible logical topologies. At running stage, we design polynomial-time algorithms for GPU placement, logical topology generating and OCS reconfiguration to minimize network contention and reduce impact to scheduled jobs. We evaluate \emph{LumosCore} using both testbed experiments and large-scale simulation. Compared to traditional hybrid optical/electrical architectures, \emph{LumosCore} increases the end-to-end training throughput by up to 39.5\% on a 128-node testbed. Compared to the state-of-art Clos architectures, \emph{LumosCore} reduces the average job completion time by up to 34.1\% in a 16k simulation platform.</p></details> |  |

Popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures which lead to incoherent or repetitive outputs. We propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by using the top token's probability as a scaling factor. Our experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing show that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text across different model families (Mistral and Llama 3) and model sizes (1B to 123B parameters), especially at higher temperatures. Human evaluations further show a clear preference for min-p sampling, in both text quality and creativity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by popular open-source LLM frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, and many others, highlighting its significant impact on improving text generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added acknowledgements and minor rewordings to make the intro/abstract more readable.

This study introduces a novel evaluation framework to uncover gender biases in LLMs, focusing on their occupational narratives. Unlike previous methods relying on structured scenarios or carefully crafted prompts, our approach leverages free-form storytelling to reveal biases embedded in the models. Systematic analyses show an overrepresentation of female characters across occupations in six widely used LLMs. Additionally, our findings reveal that LLM-generated occupational gender rankings align more closely with human stereotypes than actual labor statistics. These insights underscore the need for balanced mitigation strategies to ensure fairness while avoiding the reinforcement of new stereotypes.</p></details> |  |

ATS has drawn considerable interest in both academic and industrial circles. Many studies have been conducted in the past to survey ATS methods; however, they generally lack practicality for real-world implementations, as they often categorize previous methods from a theoretical standpoint. Moreover, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has altered conventional ATS methods. In this survey, we aim to 1) provide a comprehensive overview of ATS from a ``Process-Oriented Schema'' perspective, which is best aligned with real-world implementations; 2) comprehensively review the latest LLM-based ATS works; and 3) deliver an up-to-date survey of ATS, bridging the two-year gap in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to specifically investigate LLM-based ATS methods.</p></details> |  |

A Comparative Study on Accessible Code Generation Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15885v1)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.15885v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web accessibility is essential for inclusive digital experiences, yet the accessibility of LLM-generated code remains underexplored. This paper presents an empirical study comparing the accessibility of web code generated by GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-AWQ against human-written code. Results show that LLMs often produce more accessible code, especially for basic features like color contrast and alternative text, but struggle with complex issues such as ARIA attributes. We also assess advanced prompting strategies (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Self-Criticism), finding they offer some gains but are limited. To address these gaps, we introduce FeedA11y, a feedback-driven ReAct-based approach that significantly outperforms other methods in improving accessibility. Our work highlights the promise of LLMs for accessible code generation and emphasizes the need for feedback-based techniques to address persistent challenges.</p></details> |  |

We observe that existing Video-LLMs often suffer from action-scene hallucination due to two main factors. First, existing Video-LLMs intermingle spatial and temporal features by applying an attention operation across all tokens. Second, they use the standard Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which causes the text tokens to overemphasize certain types of tokens depending on their sequential orders. To address these issues, we introduce MASH-VLM, Mitigating Action-Scene Hallucination in Video-LLMs through disentangled spatial-temporal representations. Our approach includes two key innovations: (1) DST-attention, a novel attention mechanism that disentangles the spatial and temporal tokens within the LLM by using masked attention to restrict direct interactions between the spatial and temporal tokens; (2) Harmonic-RoPE, which extends the dimensionality of the positional IDs, allowing the spatial and temporal tokens to maintain balanced positions relative to the text tokens. To evaluate the action-scene hallucination in Video-LLMs, we introduce the UNSCENE benchmark with 1,320 videos and 4,078 QA pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASH-VLM achieves state-of-the-art results on the UNSCENE benchmark, as well as on existing video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Current efforts to reduce hallucinations primarily focus on factual errors in knowledge-grounded tasks, often neglecting hallucinations related to faulty reasoning. Meanwhile, some approaches render LLMs overly conservative, limiting their problem-solving capabilities. To mitigate hallucination and laziness in reasoning tasks, we propose Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration (Auto-CEI) to enhance LLM reasoning and align responses to the model's capabilities--assertively answering within its limits and declining when tasks exceed them. In our method, Expert Iteration explores the reasoning trajectories near the LLM policy, guiding incorrect paths back on track to reduce compounding errors and improve robustness; it also promotes appropriate "I don't know" responses after sufficient reasoning attempts. The curriculum automatically adjusts rewards, incentivizing extended reasoning before acknowledging incapability, thereby pushing the limits of LLM reasoning and aligning its behaviour with these limits. We compare Auto-CEI with various SOTA baselines across logical reasoning, mathematics, and planning tasks, where Auto-CEI achieves superior alignment by effectively balancing assertiveness and conservativeness.

We propose an ensemble approach for LLMs in code generation. Instead of relying on the output of a single model, we generate multiple candidate programs from different LLMs and apply a structured voting mechanism to select the most reliable solution. For voting, we compute syntactic and semantic similarity using CodeBLEU and behavioral equivalence using CrossHair's differential behavior analysis. By aggregating these similarity scores, we select the program that best aligns with the consensus among the candidates. We show through experiments that our ensemble approach consistently outperforms standalone LLMs on the well-known HumanEval and the more challenging LiveCodeBench datasets, achieving an accuracy of 90.2% and 50.2%, respectively, on the two datasets. In comparison, the best-performing LLM (GPT-4o) has an accuracy of 83.5% and 43.4%, respectively. Furthermore, even when restricted to free open-source models, our method achieves an accuracy of 80.5% and 41.6%, respectively, demonstrating the viability of our approach in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

Event argument extraction (EAE), at the core of event-centric understanding, is the task of identifying role-specific text spans (i.e., arguments) for a given event. Document-level EAE (DocEAE) focuses on arguments that are scattered across an entire document. In this work, we explore open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for DocEAE, and propose ULTRA, a hierarchical framework that extracts event arguments more cost-effectively. Further, it alleviates the positional bias issue intrinsic to LLMs. ULTRA sequentially reads text chunks of a document to generate a candidate argument set, upon which non-pertinent candidates are dropped through self-refinement. We introduce LEAFER to address the challenge LLMs face in locating the exact boundary of an argument. ULTRA outperforms strong baselines, including strong supervised models and ChatGPT, by 9.8% when evaluated by Exact Match (EM).</p></details> | ACL'24 Findings |

However, this increased reasoning capability also leads to excessive token generation and unnecessary problem-solving attempts. We introduce Don\'t Answer Bench (DNA Bench), a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs ability to robustly understand the tricky reasoning triggers and avoiding unnecessary generation. DNA Bench consists of 150 adversarially designed prompts that are easy for humans to understand and respond to, but surprisingly not for many of the recent prominent LLMs. DNA Bench tests models abilities across different capabilities, such as instruction adherence, hallucination avoidance, redundancy filtering, and unanswerable question recognition. We evaluate reasoning LLMs (RLMs), including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI O3-mini, Claude-3.7-sonnet and compare them against a powerful non-reasoning model, e.g., GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal that RLMs generate up to 70x more tokens than necessary, often failing at tasks that simpler non-reasoning models handle efficiently with higher accuracy. Our findings underscore the need for more effective training and inference strategies in RLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning of LLMs for GDG (RLGDG). Our training method simultaneously improves grammatical correctness and fidelity to game concepts by introducing both grammar rewards and concept rewards. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy where Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline methods using SFT alone.</p></details> |  |

However, there is growing concern about the rise of lazy reviewing practices, where reviewers use large language models (LLMs) to generate reviews instead of writing them independently. Existing tools for detecting LLM-generated content are not designed to differentiate between fully LLM-generated reviews and those merely polished by an LLM. In this work, we employ a straightforward approach to identify LLM-generated reviews - doing an indirect prompt injection via the paper PDF to ask the LLM to embed a watermark. Our focus is on presenting watermarking schemes and statistical tests that maintain a bounded family-wise error rate, when a venue evaluates multiple reviews, with a higher power as compared to standard methods like Bonferroni correction. These guarantees hold without relying on any assumptions about human-written reviews. We also consider various methods for prompt injection including font embedding and jailbreaking. We evaluate the effectiveness and various tradeoffs of these methods, including different reviewer defenses. We find a high success rate in the embedding of our watermarks in LLM-generated reviews across models. We also find that our approach is resilient to common reviewer defenses, and that the bounds on error rates in our statistical tests hold in practice while having the power to flag LLM-generated reviews, while Bonferroni correction is infeasible.</p></details> | 26 pages, 1 figure |

Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over strong baselines.

Traditionally, this process requires significant programmer effort to identify optimization opportunities, modify the code to implement the optimization, and carefully deploy and measure the optimization's impact. Despite a significant amount of work on automating program edits and promising results in small-scale settings, such performance optimizations have remained elusive in large real-world production environments, due to the scale, high degree of complexity, and reliability required. This paper introduces ECO (Efficient Code Optimizer), a system that automatically refactors source code to improve performance at scale. To achieve these performance gains, ECO searches through historical commits at scale to create a dictionary of performance anti-patterns that these commits addressed. These anti-patterns are used to search for similar patterns in a code base of billions of lines of code, pinpointing other code segments with similar potential optimization opportunities. Using a fine-tuned LLM, ECO then automatically refactors the code to generate and apply similar edits. Next, ECO verifies the transformed code, submits it for code review, and measures the impact of the optimization in production. Currently deployed on Google's hyperscale production fleet, this system has driven >25k changed lines of production code, across over 6.4k submitted commits, with a >99.5% production success rate. Over the past year, ECO has consistently resulted in significant performance savings every quarter. On average, the savings produced per quarter are equivalent to over 500k normalized CPU cores.</p></details> |  |

However, human annotations are costly to scale, model-based evaluations are susceptible to stylistic biases, and target-answer-based benchmarks are vulnerable to data contamination and cheating. To address these limitations, we propose StructTest, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability to follow compositional instructions and generate structured outputs, providing an unbiased, cost-effective, and difficult-to-cheat evaluation framework. Assessments are conducted deterministically using a rule-based evaluator, which can be easily extended to new tasks and datasets. By testing structured outputs across diverse domains including Summarization, Code, HTML, and Math, and evaluating 17 popular LLMs, we demonstrate that StructTest remains challenging even for top-performing models like Deepseek-V3/R1 and GPT-4o, establishing it as a robust proxy for measuring reasoning capabilities. We believe StructTest offers a critical and complementary approach to achieving objective and comprehensive model evaluation.</p></details> |  |

The strong performances of large language models (LLMs) in long-text generation call us to propose a LLM based framework Reader-Rewriter (R$^2$) for this task. However, there are two fundamental challenges here. First, the LLM hallucinations may cause inconsistent plot extraction and screenplay generation. Second, the causality-embedded plot lines should be effectively extracted for coherent rewriting. Therefore, two corresponding tactics are proposed: 1) A hallucination-aware refinement method (HAR) to iteratively discover and eliminate the affections of hallucinations; and 2) a causal plot-graph construction method (CPC) based on a greedy cycle-breaking algorithm to efficiently construct plot lines with event causalities. Recruiting those efficient techniques, R$^2$ utilizes two modules to mimic the human screenplay rewriting process: The Reader module adopts a sliding window and CPC to build the causal plot graphs, while the Rewriter module generates first the scene outlines based on the graphs and then the screenplays. HAR is integrated into both modules for accurate inferences of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R$^2$, which substantially outperforms three existing approaches (51.3%, 22.6%, and 57.1% absolute increases) in pairwise comparison at the overall win rate for GPT-4o.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

However, it is still unclear how well LLMs generalize to sophisticated and naturally occurring mathematical statements. To address this gap, we investigate the task of autoformalizing real-world mathematical definitions -- a critical component of mathematical discourse. Specifically, we introduce two novel resources for autoformalisation, collecting definitions from Wikipedia (Def_Wiki) and arXiv papers (Def_ArXiv). We then systematically evaluate a range of LLMs, analyzing their ability to formalize definitions into Isabelle/HOL. Furthermore, we investigate strategies to enhance LLMs' performance including refinement through external feedback from Proof Assistants, and formal definition grounding, where we guide LLMs through relevant contextual elements from formal mathematical libraries. Our findings reveal that definitions present a greater challenge compared to existing benchmarks, such as miniF2F. In particular, we found that LLMs still struggle with self-correction, and aligning with relevant mathematical libraries. At the same time, structured refinement methods and definition grounding strategies yield notable improvements of up to 16% on self-correction capabilities and 43% on the reduction of undefined errors, highlighting promising directions for enhancing LLM-based autoformalization in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to billions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and performance remain underexplored. Additionally, inconsistencies in training data and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it difficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with diverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified training protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis systematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4, LLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and instruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and performance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a comprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based architectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional experiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and variations in pre-training datasets. Overall, our results provide insights into the design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation framework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model development.

ContextualJudgeBench for Evaluating LLM-based Judges in Contextual Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15620v1)** | 2025-03-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.15620v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large language model (LLM)-as-judge paradigm has been used to meet the demand for a cheap, reliable, and fast evaluation of model outputs during AI system development and post-deployment monitoring. While judge models -- LLMs finetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs -- have been touted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on non-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of contextual settings -- those where external information is used as context to generate an output -- is surprising given the increasing prevalence of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual assessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner priorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing responses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are equally factual). To address the gap, we propose ContextualJudgeBench, a judge benchmark with 2,000 challenging response pairs across eight splits inspired by real-world contextual evaluation scenarios. We build our benchmark with a multi-pronged data construction pipeline that leverages both existing human annotations and model-based perturbations. Our comprehensive study across 11 judge models and 9 general purpose models, reveals that the contextual information and its assessment criteria present a significant challenge to even state-of-the-art models. For example, OpenAI's o1, the best-performing model, barely reaches 55% consistent accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

The YOLOv12n configuration achieved the highest precision at 0.916, the highest recall at 0.969, and the highest mean Average Precision (mAP@50) at 0.978. In comparison, the YOLOv11 series was led by YOLO11x, which achieved the highest precision at 0.857, recall at 0.85, and mAP@50 at 0.91. For the YOLOv10 series, YOLOv10b and YOLOv10l both achieved the highest precision at 0.85, with YOLOv10n achieving the highest recall at 0.8 and mAP@50 at 0.89. These findings demonstrated that YOLOv12, when trained on realistic LLM-generated datasets surpassed its predecessors in key performance metrics. The technique also offered a cost-effective solution by reducing the need for extensive manual data collection in the agricultural field. In addition, this study compared the computational efficiency of all versions of YOLOv12, v11 and v10, where YOLOv11n reported the lowest inference time at 4.7 ms, compared to YOLOv12n's 5.6 ms and YOLOv10n's 5.9 ms. Although YOLOv12 is new and more accurate than YOLOv11, and YOLOv10, YOLO11n still stays the fastest YOLO model among YOLOv10, YOLOv11 and YOLOv12 series of models.

However, existing multi-turn RL algorithms for optimizing LLM agents fail to perform effective credit assignment over multiple turns while leveraging the generalization capabilities of LLMs and it remains unclear how to develop such algorithms. To study this, we first introduce a new benchmark, ColBench, where an LLM agent interacts with a human collaborator over multiple turns to solve realistic tasks in backend programming and frontend design. Building on this benchmark, we propose a novel RL algorithm, SWEET-RL (RL with Step-WisE Evaluation from Training-time information), that uses a carefully designed optimization objective to train a critic model with access to additional training-time information. The critic provides step-level rewards for improving the policy model. Our experiments demonstrate that SWEET-RL achieves a 6% absolute improvement in success and win rates on ColBench compared to other state-of-the-art multi-turn RL algorithms, enabling Llama-3.1-8B to match or exceed the performance of GPT4-o in realistic collaborative content creation.</p></details> | 29 pages, 16 figures |

However, those MSPs might still encode useful uncertainty information. Specifically, we hypothesized that wrong answers would be associated with smaller MSPs compared to correct answers. Via rigorous statistical testing, we show that this hypothesis holds for models which perform well on the underlying Q&A task. We also find a strong direction correlation between Q&A accuracy and MSP correctness prediction, while finding no correlation between Q&A accuracy and calibration error. This suggests that within the current fine-tuning paradigm, we can expect correctness prediction but not calibration to improve as LLM capabilities progress. To demonstrate the utility of correctness prediction, we show that when models have the option to abstain, performance can be improved by selectively abstaining based on the MSP of the initial model response, using only a small amount of labeled data to choose the MSP threshold.</p></details> |  |

Prior research using text-only models have struggled to address this problem in a reliable and scalable way due to (1) limited reasoning capabilities, (2) information loss from converting visual records to text, and (3) lack of a generic EHR integration to extract patient data. Methods: We introduce a broadly applicable, integration-free, LLM-powered pipeline that automates patient-trial matching using unprocessed documents extracted from EHRs. Our approach leverages (1) the new reasoning-LLM paradigm, enabling the assessment of even the most complex criteria, (2) visual capabilities of latest LLMs to interpret medical records without lossy image-to-text conversions, and (3) multimodal embeddings for efficient medical record search. The pipeline was validated on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection dataset (288 diabetic patients) and a real-world dataset composed of 485 patients from 30 different sites matched against 36 diverse trials. Results: On the n2c2 dataset, our method achieved a new state-of-the-art criterion-level accuracy of 93\%. In real-world trials, the pipeline yielded an accuracy of 87\%, undermined by the difficulty to replicate human decision-making when medical records lack sufficient information. Nevertheless, users were able to review overall eligibility in under 9 minutes per patient on average, representing an 80\% improvement over traditional manual chart reviews. Conclusion: This pipeline demonstrates robust performance in clinical trial patient matching without requiring custom integration with site systems or trial-specific tailoring, thereby enabling scalable deployment across sites seeking to leverage AI for patient matching.</p></details> |  |

However, existing CoT methods often exhibit a tendency toward "overthinking", where the LLM consistently applies reasoning strategies without adequately considering the task's underlying complexity. This results in the LLMs allocating excessive computational resources, in terms of tokens, to relatively simple tasks or problems where the correct answer is already evident. Additionally, this overthinking may lead LLMs down incorrect reasoning paths, resulting in incorrect code generation. In this paper, we introduce UnCertainty-Aware Chain-of-Thought (UnCert-CoT), an LLM-based approach designed to enhance code generation by incorporating an uncertainty-aware CoT reasoning mechanism, which focuses computational resources on targeting points where LLMs are more prone to error. We propose two confidence-based uncertainty measures: Entropy-based and Probability Differential-based methods. When uncertainty is high, UnCert-CoT activates CoT-decoding to generate multiple reasoning paths and selects the final code that exhibits the highest likelihood of correctness. In contrast, LLM directly generates the code when uncertainty is low. This uncertainty judgment mechanism allows LLMs to prioritize complex tasks and avoid unnecessary steps in simpler cases, thereby improving overall efficiency and accuracy in code generation. Our experimental results demonstrate that UnCert-CoT significantly enhances code generation accuracy on challenging benchmark MHPP(Mostly Hard Python Problems), it achieves improvements up to 6.1% on PassRate accuracy, particularly in situations where traditional LLMs are prone to errors.</p></details> |  |

We wonder: can personality tests be applied to these agents to analyze their behavior, similar to humans? We introduce TRAIT, a new benchmark consisting of 8K multi-choice questions designed to assess the personality of LLMs. TRAIT is built on two psychometrically validated small human questionnaires, Big Five Inventory (BFI) and Short Dark Triad (SD-3), enhanced with the ATOMIC-10X knowledge graph to a variety of real-world scenarios. TRAIT also outperforms existing personality tests for LLMs in terms of reliability and validity, achieving the highest scores across four key metrics: Content Validity, Internal Validity, Refusal Rate, and Reliability. Using TRAIT, we reveal two notable insights into personalities of LLMs: 1) LLMs exhibit distinct and consistent personality, which is highly influenced by their training data (e.g., data used for alignment tuning), and 2) current prompting techniques have limited effectiveness in eliciting certain traits, such as high psychopathy or low conscientiousness, suggesting the need for further research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL2025 Findings</p></details> |

However, most existing models primarily focus on analyzing input signals using text instructions, overlooking scenarios in which speech instructions and audio are mixed and serve as inputs to the model. To address these challenges, we introduce Solla, a novel framework designed to understand speech-based questions and hear the acoustic context concurrently. Solla incorporates an audio tagging module to effectively identify and represent audio events, as well as an ASR-assisted prediction method to improve comprehension of spoken content. To rigorously evaluate Solla and other publicly available models, we propose a new benchmark dataset called SA-Eval, which includes three tasks: audio event classification, audio captioning, and audio question answering. SA-Eval has diverse speech instruction with various speaking styles, encompassing two difficulty levels, easy and hard, to capture the range of real-world acoustic conditions. Experimental results show that Solla performs on par with or outperforms baseline models on both the easy and hard test sets, underscoring its effectiveness in jointly understanding speech and audio.</p></details> |  |

Using constructed languages generated by cryptographic means as controlled test environments, we designed experiments to assess an LLM's ability to explicitly learn and apply grammar rules. Our results demonstrate that while LLMs possess a measurable capacity for explicit learning, this ability diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic phenomena at hand increases. Supervised fine-tuning on chains of thought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to typologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point to the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning strategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies extract long contexts from the repository as inputs and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. However, we reveal a severe limitation of LLMs, i.e., LLMs may ignore the information within long contexts in code completion. In other words, even the contexts contain useful information (e.g., relevant APIs or similar code), LLMs may fail to utilize this information. We think this limitation is caused by an inherent bias in LLMs, i.e., relying on nearby contexts and ignoring long-range contexts. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach named CoLT. The core idea of CoLT is to provide explicit supervision signals, which emphasize that long-range contexts may hold relevant information. Specifically, CoLT proposes a reinforcement learning-based training, which explicitly encourages models to utilize the information within long contexts and punishes models for ignoring long contexts. To support CoLT, we release CoLT-132K, a large-scale dataset with 132k samples across four languages, each containing long-context inputs. We apply CoLT to a popular LLM - aiXcoder-7B and release aiXcoder-7B-v2. We conduct extensive experiments on CoLT-132K and a public benchmark - CrossCodeEval. Our experiments yield the results: 1. Effectiveness. CoLT substantially improves aiXcoder-7B. aiXcoder-7B-v2 outperforms aiXcoder-7B by up to 44% in exact match. aiXcoder-7B-v2 becomes the state-of-the-art 7B model in code completion and even surpasses larger models. 2. Generalizability. The capability learned by CoLT can generalize to new languages. Besides, CoLT is model-agnostic and effectively improves multiple LLMs. 3. Enhanced Context Utilization Capability. CoLT significantly improves the capability of LLMs in utilizing the relevant information within long contexts.</p></details> |  |

While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) puts a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce a general variation method for multiple-choice questions that completely dissociates the correct answer from previously seen tokens or concepts, requiring LLMs to understand and reason (rather than memorizing) in order to answer correctly. Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and Spanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset. Results show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our proposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access 2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models. Notably, the most accurate model in our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust (DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may not be the ones with better reasoning capabilities. Also, we see larger accuracy drops in public (vs private) datasets and questions posed in their original language (vs a manual translation), which are signs of contamination and also point to a relevant role of recall/memorization in current LLMs' answers.</p></details> |  |

Existing works have shown that RAG can help with software development tasks such as code generation, code update, and test generation. Yet, the effectiveness of adapting LLMs to fast-evolving or less common API libraries using RAG remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step to study this unexplored yet practical setting - when developers code with a less common library, they often refer to its API documentation; likewise, when LLMs are allowed to look up API documentation via RAG, to what extent can LLMs be advanced? To mimic such a setting, we select four less common open-source Python libraries with a total of 1017 eligible APIs. We study the factors that affect the effectiveness of using the documentation of less common API libraries as additional knowledge for retrieval and generation. Our intensive study yields interesting findings: (1) RAG helps improve LLMs' performance by 83%-220%. (2) Example code contributes the most to advance LLMs, instead of the descriptive texts and parameter lists in the API documentation. (3) LLMs could sometimes tolerate mild noises (typos in description or incorrect parameters) by referencing their pre-trained knowledge or document context. Finally, we suggest that developers pay more attention to the quality and diversity of the code examples in the API documentation. The study sheds light on future low-code software development workflows.</p></details> |  |

We have curated a comprehensive dataset of 17K expert-verified synthesis recipes from open-access literature, which forms the basis of our newly developed benchmark, AlchemyBench. AlchemyBench offers an end-to-end framework that supports research in large language models applied to synthesis prediction. It encompasses key tasks, including raw materials and equipment prediction, synthesis procedure generation, and characterization outcome forecasting. We propose an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that leverages large language models for automated evaluation, demonstrating strong statistical agreement with expert assessments. Overall, our contributions offer a supportive foundation for exploring the capabilities of LLMs in predicting and guiding materials synthesis, ultimately paving the way for more efficient experimental design and accelerated innovation in materials science.</p></details> | under review |

It can significantly reduce computational costs to adapt to large language models (LLMs). Given its ability to precisely target critical components within LLMs, model editing shows great potential for efficient fine-tuning applications. In this work, we investigate model editing to serve an efficient method for adapting LLMs to solve aspect-based sentiment classification. Through causal interventions, we trace and determine which neuron hidden states are essential for the prediction of the model. By performing interventions and restorations on each component of an LLM, we identify the importance of these components for aspect-based sentiment classification. Our findings reveal that a distinct set of mid-layer representations is essential for detecting the sentiment polarity of given aspect words. Leveraging these insights, we develop a model editing approach that focuses exclusively on these critical parts of the LLM, leading to a more efficient method for adapting LLMs. Our in-domain and out-of-domain experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves competitive results compared to the currently strongest methods with significantly fewer trainable parameters, highlighting a more efficient and interpretable fine-tuning strategy.</p></details> | AAAI2025 |

We use the infinitely scalable Tents puzzle, which has a known linear-time solution, to analyze this scaling behavior. Our results show that reasoning effort scales with problem size, but only up to a critical problem complexity. Beyond this threshold, the reasoning effort does not continue to increase, and may even decrease. This observation highlights a critical limitation in the logical coherence of current LLMs as problem complexity increases, and underscores the need for strategies to improve reasoning scalability. Furthermore, our results reveal significant performance differences between current state-of-the-art reasoning models when faced with increasingly complex logical puzzles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Reasoning and Planning for LLMs</p></details> |

However, the lack of datasets and benchmarks in the public domain prevents the development and fair evaluation of LLM solutions. This paper highlights our latest advances in open datasets and benchmarks from three perspectives: (1) RTLLM 2.0, an updated benchmark assessing LLM's capability in design RTL generation. The benchmark is augmented to 50 hand-crafted designs. Each design provides the design description, test cases, and a correct RTL code. (2) AssertEval, an open-source benchmark assessing the LLM's assertion generation capabilities for RTL verification. The benchmark includes 18 designs, each providing specification, signal definition, and correct RTL code. (3) RTLCoder-Data, an extended open-source dataset with 80K instruction-code data samples. Moreover, we propose a new verification-based method to verify the functionality correctness of training data samples. Based on this technique, we further release a dataset with 7K verified high-quality samples. These three studies are integrated into one framework, providing off-the-shelf support for the development and evaluation of LLMs for RTL code generation and verification. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that LLM performance can be boosted by enlarging the training dataset, improving data quality, and improving the training scheme.</p></details> | ICCAD'24 |

This work addresses profiling specifically in the context of code datasets for Large Language Models (code-LLMs), where data quality directly influences tasks such as code generation and summarization. Characterizing code datasets in terms of programming language concepts enables better insights and targeted data curation. Our proposed methodology decomposes code data profiling into two phases: (1) an offline phase where LLMs are leveraged to derive and learn rules for extracting syntactic and semantic concepts across various programming languages, including previously unseen or low-resource languages, and (2) an online deterministic phase applying these derived rules for efficient real-time analysis. This hybrid approach is customizable, extensible to new syntactic and semantic constructs, and scalable to multiple languages. Experimentally, our LLM-aided method achieves a mean accuracy of 90.33% for syntactic extraction rules and semantic classification accuracies averaging 80% and 77% across languages and semantic concepts, respectively.</p></details> | 21 pages |

While existing approaches primarily focus on detecting server crashes and error codes, they often overlook logical issues that arise due to evolving business logic and domain-specific requirements. To address this limitation, we propose LogiAgent, a novel approach for logical testing of REST systems. Built upon a large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent framework, LogiAgent integrates a Test Scenario Generator, API Request Executor, and API Response Validator to collaboratively generate, execute, and validate API test scenarios. Unlike traditional testing methods that focus on status codes like 5xx, LogiAgent incorporates logical oracles that assess responses based on business logic, ensuring more comprehensive testing. The system is further enhanced by an Execution Memory component that stores historical API execution data for contextual consistency. We conduct extensive experiments across 12 real-world REST systems, demonstrating that LogiAgent effectively identifies 234 logical issues with an accuracy of 66.19%. Additionally, it basically excels in detecting server crashes and achieves superior test coverage compared to four state-of-the-art REST API testing tools. An ablation study confirms the significant contribution of LogiAgent's memory components to improving test coverage.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, thanks to the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), automated repair has achieved remarkable progress. Advanced APR techniques powered by conversational LLMs, most notably ChatGPT, have exhibited impressive repair abilities and gained increasing popularity due to the capabilities of the underlying LLMs in providing repair feedback and performing iterative patch improvement. Despite the superiority, conversational APR techniques still fail to repair a large number of bugs. For example, a state-of-the-art conversational technique ChatRepair does not correctly repair over half of the single-function bugs in the Defects4J dataset. To understand the effectiveness and failures of conversational LLM-based repair and provide possible directions for improvement, we studied the exemplary ChatRepair with a focus on comparing the effectiveness of its cloze-style and full function repair strategies, assessing its key iterative component for patch improvement, and analyzing the repair failures. Our study has led to a series of findings, which we believe provide key implications for future research.</p></details> |  |

In this position paper, I discuss the limitations of this assumption and provide preliminary thoughts for how to build systems that can better represent the cultural diversity within the Arab world. The invalidity of the cultural homogeneity assumption might seem obvious, yet, it is widely adopted in developing multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs. I hope that this paper will encourage the NLP community to be considerate of the cultural diversity within various communities speaking the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the C3NLP workshop (Co-located with NAACL 2025)</p></details> |

While open-ended question answering tasks are more challenging to evaluate, MCQA tasks are, in principle, easier to assess, as the model's answer is thought to be simple to extract and is directly compared to a set of predefined choices. However, recent studies have started to question the reliability of MCQA evaluation, showing that multiple factors can significantly impact the reported performance of LLMs, especially when the model generates free-form text before selecting one of the answer choices. In this work, we shed light on the inconsistencies of MCQA evaluation strategies, which can lead to inaccurate and misleading model comparisons. We systematically analyze whether existing answer extraction methods are aligned with human judgment, and how they are influenced by answer constraints in the prompt across different domains. Our experiments demonstrate that traditional evaluation strategies often underestimate LLM capabilities, while LLM-based answer extractors are prone to systematic errors. Moreover, we reveal a fundamental trade-off between including format constraints in the prompt to simplify answer extraction and allowing models to generate free-form text to improve reasoning. Our findings call for standardized evaluation methodologies and highlight the need for more reliable and consistent MCQA evaluation practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages (9 main), 11 figures, 21 tables</p></details> |

Despite the complexity and cost of collecting eye-tracking data, there has also been limited progress in systematically using these signals for code LLM training. To address both issues, we propose a cohesive pipeline spanning augmentation and reward-based fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce (1) an eye-tracking path augmentation method to expand programmer attention datasets, (2) a pattern abstraction step that refines raw fixations into learnable attention motifs, and (3) a reward-guided strategy for integrating these insights directly into a CodeT5 supervised fine-tuning process. Our experiments yield +7.16 in CodeBLEU on the CodeXGlue benchmark for code summarization, underscoring how uniting human and machine attention can boost code intelligence. We hope this work encourages broader exploration of human-centric methods in next-generation AI4SE.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting these models to specialized domains using private datasets stored on resource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones and personal computers, remains challenging due to significant privacy concerns and limited computational resources. Existing model adaptation methods either compromise data privacy by requiring data transmission or jeopardize model privacy by exposing proprietary LLM parameters. To address these challenges, we propose Prada, a novel privacy-preserving and efficient black-box LLM adaptation system using private on-device datasets. Prada employs a lightweight proxy model fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) locally on user devices. During inference, Prada leverages the logits offset, i.e., difference in outputs between the base and adapted proxy models, to iteratively refine outputs from a remote black-box LLM. This offset-based adaptation approach preserves both data privacy and model privacy, as there is no need to share sensitive data or proprietary model parameters. Furthermore, we incorporate speculative decoding to further speed up the inference process of Prada, making the system practically deployable on bandwidth-constrained edge devices, enabling a more practical deployment of Prada. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate that Prada achieves performance comparable to centralized fine-tuning methods while significantly reducing computational overhead by up to 60% and communication costs by up to 80%.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing intent clustering methods often fail to align with human perceptions due to the heavy reliance on embedding distance metrics and sentence embeddings. To address these limitations, we propose integrating the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs into an $\textbf{LLM-in-the-loop (LLM-ITL)}$ intent clustering framework. Specifically, this paper (1) investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic coherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy; (2) designs an LLM-ITL clustering algorithm that facilitates the iterative discovery of coherent intent clusters; and (3) proposes task-specific techniques tailored for customer service dialogue intent clustering. Since existing English benchmarks pose limited semantic diversity and intent labels, we introduced a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset, comprising over 100,000 real customer service calls and 1,507 human-annotated intent clusters. The proposed approaches significantly outperformed LLM-guided baselines, achieving notable improvements in clustering quality and a 12% boost in the downstream intent classification task. Combined with several best practices, our findings highlight the potential of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable and human-aligned problem-solving.

A recent study by Meta revealed that 14%-22% of software failures stem from outdated tests that fail to reflect changes in the codebase. This highlights the need to keep tests in sync with code changes to ensure software reliability. In this paper, we present UTFix, a novel approach for repairing unit tests when their corresponding focal methods undergo changes. UTFix addresses two critical issues: assertion failure and reduced code coverage caused by changes in the focal method. Our approach leverages language models to repair unit tests by providing contextual information such as static code slices, dynamic code slices, and failure messages. We evaluate UTFix on our generated synthetic benchmarks (Tool-Bench), and real-world benchmarks. Tool- Bench includes diverse changes from popular open-source Python GitHub projects, where UTFix successfully repaired 89.2% of assertion failures and achieved 100% code coverage for 96 tests out of 369 tests. On the real-world benchmarks, UTFix repairs 60% of assertion failures while achieving 100% code coverage for 19 out of 30 unit tests. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study focused on unit test in evolving Python projects. Our contributions include the development of UTFix, the creation of Tool-Bench and real-world benchmarks, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of LLM-based methods in addressing unit test failures due to software evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, International Conference on Object-oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA) 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can facilitate PRF for zero-shot LLM-based dense retrieval, extending the recently proposed PromptReps method. Specifically, our approach uses LLMs to extract salient passage features-such as keywords and summaries-from top-ranked documents, which are then integrated into PromptReps to produce enhanced query representations. Experiments on passage retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating PRF significantly boosts retrieval performance. Notably, smaller rankers with PRF can match the effectiveness of larger rankers without PRF, highlighting PRF's potential to improve LLM-driven search while maintaining an efficient balance between effectiveness and resource usage.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose a novel distributed on-device LLM inference framework that leverages tensor parallelism to partition the neural network tensors (e.g., weight matrices) of one LLM across multiple edge devices for collaborative inference. A key challenge in tensor parallelism is the frequent all-reduce operations for aggregating intermediate layer outputs across participating devices, which incurs significant communication overhead. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose an over-the-air computation (AirComp) approach that harnesses the analog superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels to perform fast all-reduce steps. To utilize the heterogeneous computational capabilities of edge devices and mitigate communication distortions, we investigate a joint model assignment and transceiver optimization problem to minimize the average transmission error. The resulting mixed-timescale stochastic non-convex optimization problem is intractable, and we propose an efficient two-stage algorithm to solve it. Moreover, we prove that the proposed algorithm converges almost surely to a stationary point of the original problem. Comprehensive simulation results will show that the proposed framework outperforms existing benchmark schemes, achieving up to 5x inference speed acceleration and improving inference accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.12559</p></details> |

However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Conference on Learning Representations 2025(ICLR2025)</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has driven the growing need for intelligence, efficient, and adaptable wireless networks. Wireless networks require the empowerment of RL-based LLMs while these models also benefit from wireless networks to broaden their application scenarios. Specifically, RL-based LLMs can enhance wireless communication systems through intelligent resource allocation, adaptive network optimization, and real-time decision-making. Conversely, wireless networks provide a vital infrastructure for the efficient training, deployment, and distributed inference of RL-based LLMs, especially in decentralized and edge computing environments. This mutual empowerment highlights the need for a deeper exploration of the interplay between these two domains. We first review recent advancements in wireless communications, highlighting the associated challenges and potential solutions. We then discuss the progress of RL-based LLMs, focusing on key technologies for LLM training, challenges, and potential solutions. Subsequently, we explore the mutual empowerment between these two fields, highlighting key motivations, open challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we provide insights into future directions, applications, and their societal impact to further explore this intersection, paving the way for next-generation intelligent communication systems. Overall, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between RL-based LLMs and wireless networks, offering a vision where these domains empower each other to drive innovations.</p></details> | 25 pages, 13 figures |

However, the code generated by LLMs often contains vulnerabilities. Several secure code generation methods have been proposed to address this issue, but their current evaluation schemes leave several concerns unaddressed. Specifically, most existing studies evaluate security and functional correctness separately, using different datasets. That is, they assess vulnerabilities using security-related code datasets while validating functionality with general code datasets. In addition, prior research primarily relies on a single static analyzer, CodeQL, to detect vulnerabilities in generated code, which limits the scope of security evaluation. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study to systematically assess the improvements introduced by four state-of-the-art secure code generation techniques. Specifically, we apply both security inspection and functionality validation to the same generated code and evaluate these two aspects together. We also employ three popular static analyzers and two LLMs to identify potential vulnerabilities in the generated code. Our study reveals that existing techniques often compromise the functionality of generated code to enhance security. Their overall performance remains limited when evaluating security and functionality together. In fact, many techniques even degrade the performance of the base LLM. Our further inspection reveals that these techniques often either remove vulnerable lines of code entirely or generate ``garbage code'' that is unrelated to the intended task. Moreover, the commonly used static analyzer CodeQL fails to detect several vulnerabilities, further obscuring the actual security improvements achieved by existing techniques. Our study serves as a guideline for a more rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of secure code generation performance in future work.</p></details> |  |

However, this task poses significant challenges, requiring both professional medical knowledge and the development of accurate and explainable models. In this paper, we propose LLM-MTD (Large Language Model for Multi-Task Depression Detection), a novel approach that leverages a pre-trained large language model to simultaneously classify social media posts for depression and generate textual explanations grounded in medical diagnostic criteria. We train our model using a multi-task learning framework with a combined loss function that optimizes both classification accuracy and explanation quality. We evaluate LLM-MTD on the benchmark Reddit Self-Reported Depression Dataset (RSDD) and compare its performance against several competitive baseline methods, including traditional machine learning and fine-tuned BERT. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLM-MTD achieves state-of-the-art performance in depression detection, showing significant improvements in AUPRC and other key metrics. Furthermore, human evaluation of the generated explanations reveals their relevance, completeness, and medical accuracy, highlighting the enhanced interpretability of our approach.

SE detection in multi-turn, chat-based interactions is considerably more complex than single-instance detection due to the dynamic nature of these conversations. A critical factor in mitigating this threat is understanding the mechanisms through which SE attacks operate, specifically how attackers exploit vulnerabilities and how victims' personality traits contribute to their susceptibility. In this work, we propose an LLM-agentic framework, SE-VSim, to simulate SE attack mechanisms by generating multi-turn conversations. We model victim agents with varying personality traits to assess how psychological profiles influence susceptibility to manipulation. Using a dataset of over 1000 simulated conversations, we examine attack scenarios in which adversaries, posing as recruiters, funding agencies, and journalists, attempt to extract sensitive information. Based on this analysis, we present a proof of concept, SE-OmniGuard, to offer personalized protection to users by leveraging prior knowledge of the victims personality, evaluating attack strategies, and monitoring information exchanges in conversations to identify potential SE attempts.</p></details> |  |

This has led to a broad design space, including colocating stored KV caches with (or close to) GPUs to various KV cache compression. However, a key question remains unanswered: can these delay reductions also be economically favorable? Specifically, we ask whether a developer can use public cloud services to store precomputed KV caches and reuse them to save delay without incurring more costs in terms of compute, storage, and network. To answer this question, we propose an validated analytical model for the cloud cost (in compute, storage, and network) of storing and reusing KV caches based on various workload parameters, such as reuse frequency, generated text lengths, model sizes, etc. Preliminary results show that KV cache reusing is able to save both delay and cloud cost across a range of workloads with long context. And we call more efforts on building more economical context augmented LLM by KV cache reusing.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can sometimes match humans in analogical reasoning tasks, opening the possibility that analogical reasoning might emerge from domain general processes. However, it is still debated whether these emergent capacities are largely superficial and limited to simple relations seen during training or whether they rather encompass the flexible representational and mapping capabilities which are the focus of leading cognitive models of analogy. In this study, we introduce novel analogical reasoning tasks that require participants to map between semantically contentful words and sequences of letters and other abstract characters. This task necessitates the ability to flexibly re-represent rich semantic information-an ability which is known to be central to human analogy but which is thus far not well-captured by existing cognitive theories and models. We assess the performance of both human participants and LLMs on tasks focusing on reasoning from semantic structure and semantic content, introducing variations that test the robustness of their analogical inferences. Advanced LLMs match human performance across several conditions, though humans and LLMs respond differently to certain task variations and semantic distractors. Our results thus provide new evidence that LLMs might offer a how-possibly explanation of human analogical reasoning in contexts that are not yet well modeled by existing theories, but that even today's best models are unlikely to yield how-actually explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The title has been changed from Semantic Structure-Mapping in LLM and Human Analogical Reasoning to LLMs as Models for Analogical Reasoning to improve clarity and accuracy</p></details> |

Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called "MufassirQAS". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information.

Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.</p></details> |  |

It explores the common ethical challenges posed by both LLMs and other AI systems, such as privacy and fairness, as well as ethical challenges uniquely arising from LLMs. It highlights challenges such as hallucination, verifiable accountability, and decoding censorship complexity, which are unique to LLMs and distinct from those encountered in traditional AI systems. The study underscores the need to tackle these complexities to ensure accountability, reduce biases, and enhance transparency in the influential role that LLMs play in shaping information dissemination. It proposes mitigation strategies and future directions for LLM ethics, advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration. It recommends ethical frameworks tailored to specific domains and dynamic auditing systems adapted to diverse contexts.

Notably, it is during the final phase that these models are exposed to negative examples -- incorrect, rejected, or suboptimal responses to queries. This paper delves into the role of negative examples in the training of LLMs, using a likelihood-ratio (Likra) model on multiple-choice question answering benchmarks to precisely manage the influence and the volume of negative examples. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) During a critical phase in training, Likra with negative examples demonstrates a significantly larger improvement per training example compared to SFT using only positive examples. This leads to a sharp jump in the learning curve for Likra unlike the smooth and gradual improvement of SFT; (2) negative examples that are plausible but incorrect (near-misses) exert a greater influence; and (3) while training with positive examples fails to significantly decrease the likelihood of plausible but incorrect answers, training with negative examples more accurately identifies them. These results indicate a potentially significant role for negative examples in improving accuracy and reducing hallucinations for LLMs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Specifically, we first apply a large language model (namely, ChatGPT) to the task of collecting sentences that mention the target celebrity from articles about celebrities on Web pages. Next, the collected sentences are categorized based on their contents by ChatGPT, where ChatGPT assigns a category name to each of those categories. Those assigned category names are referred to as "aspects" of each celebrity. Then, by applying the framework of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we show that the large language model is quite effective in the task of judging good/evil reputation of aspects and descriptions of each celebrity. Finally, also in terms of proving the advantages of the proposed method over existing services incorporating RAG functions, we show that the proposed method of judging good/evil of aspects/descriptions of each celebrity significantly outperform an existing service incorporating RAG functions.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging advanced LLMs, this research aims to enhance the understanding and filtering of cryptocurrency discourse, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making in this volatile sector.

Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution. In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring. MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability. Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations. Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations. A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable. These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</p></details> |  |

Our method achieves a 93% success rate in the 'fetch me' task completion with failure recovery, highlighting its capability in both failure reasoning and task planning.

Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.</p></details> |  |

In such cases, the LLM's best response may be to ask a clarifying question to elicit more information. Existing LLMs often respond by presupposing a single interpretation of such ambiguous requests, frustrating users who intended a different interpretation. We speculate this is caused by current preference data labeling practice, where LLM responses are evaluated only on their prior contexts. To address this, we assign preference labels by simulating their expected outcomes in future turns. This allows LLMs to learn to ask clarifying questions when it can generate responses that are tailored to each user interpretation in future turns. On open-domain QA datasets with multiple annotations, we evaluate systems based on their ability to ask clarifying questions to recover each user's interpretation and expected answer. We compare systems trained using our proposed preference labeling methods against standard methods, which assign preferences based on only prior context. Our method achieves a 5% improvement in F1 measured against the answer set from different interpretations of each query, showing the value of modeling future conversation turns. We further demonstrate that our method can be used to train models to judiciously determine when to ask clarifying questions, directly answering the question when clarification is unnecessary. In our experiments, we find that our method achieves a 3% improvement in accuracy of such judgments over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We propose a GeoQA Portal using a multi-agent Large Language Model framework for seamless natural language interaction with geospatial data. Complex queries are broken into subtasks handled by specialized agents, retrieving relevant geographic data efficiently. Task plans are shown to users, boosting transparency. The portal supports default and custom data inputs for flexibility. Semantic search via word vector similarity aids data retrieval despite imperfect terms.

However, current tree induction methods often face limitations such as suboptimal solutions from greedy methods or prohibitive computational costs and limited applicability of exact optimization approaches. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary optimization method for decision tree induction based on genetic programming (GP). Our key innovation is the integration of semantic priors and domain-specific knowledge about the search space into the optimization algorithm. To this end, we introduce $\texttt{LLEGO}$, a framework that incorporates semantic priors into genetic search operators through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby enhancing search efficiency and targeting regions of the search space that yield decision trees with superior generalization performance. This is operationalized through novel genetic operators that work with structured natural language prompts, effectively utilizing LLMs as conditional generative models and sources of semantic knowledge. Specifically, we introduce $\textit{fitness-guided}$ crossover to exploit high-performing regions, and $\textit{diversity-guided}$ mutation for efficient global exploration of the search space. These operators are controlled by corresponding hyperparameters that enable a more nuanced balance between exploration and exploitation across the search space. Empirically, we demonstrate across various benchmarks that $\texttt{LLEGO}$ evolves superior-performing trees compared to existing tree induction methods, and exhibits significantly more efficient search performance compared to conventional GP approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>*Liu ...</summary><p>*Liu and Huynh contributed equally.

Automatic code generation using large language models is becoming increasingly widespread, but it rarely considers producing strong correctness guarantees. In this study, we explore the ability of LLMs to produce verified code in three verification languages (Dafny, Nagini, and Verus). To do so, we use manually curated datasets derived from the state-ofthe-art Python benchmark, HumanEval. We also assess what types of information are sufficient to achieve good-quality results.</p></details> |  |

To address this, LLM-based judges have been proposed, which compare the outputs of two LLMs enabling the ranking of models without human intervention. While several approaches have been proposed, many confounding factors are present between different papers. For instance the model, the prompt and other hyperparameters are typically changed at the same time making apple-to-apple comparisons challenging. In this paper, we propose to systematically analyze and tune hyperparameter of LLM judges. To alleviate the high cost of evaluating a judge, we propose to leverage multi-objective multi-fidelity which allows to find judges that trades accuracy for cost and also reduce significantly the cost of the search. Our method identifies judges that not only outperform existing benchmarks in accuracy and cost-efficiency but also utilize open-weight models, ensuring greater accessibility and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

While recently proposed probing techniques provide insights through activation analysis, they require "white-box" access to model internals, often unavailable. Current "gray-box" approaches typically analyze only the probability of the actual tokens in the sequence with simple task-specific heuristics. Importantly, these methods overlook the rich information contained in the full token distribution at each processing step. To address these limitations, we propose that gray-box analysis should leverage the complete observable output of LLMs, consisting of both the previously used token probabilities as well as the complete token distribution sequences - a unified data type we term LOS (LLM Output Signature). To this end, we develop a transformer-based approach to process LOS that theoretically guarantees approximation of existing techniques while enabling more nuanced analysis. Our approach achieves superior performance on hallucination and data contamination detection in gray-box settings, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong transfer capabilities across datasets and LLMs, suggesting that LOS captures fundamental patterns in LLM behavior.

While they achieve remarkable performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, they often rely on their internal knowledge to solve problems, which can be inadequate for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address this, we propose \textbf{R1-Searcher}, a novel two-stage outcome-based RL approach designed to enhance the search capabilities of LLMs. This method allows LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems to access additional knowledge during the reasoning process. Our framework relies exclusively on RL, without requiring process rewards or distillation for a cold start. % effectively generalizing to out-of-domain datasets and supporting both Base and Instruct models.

Existing approaches, including search-based software testing (SBST) and recent LLM-based methods, often suffer from type errors, leading to invalid inputs and assertion failures, ultimately reducing testing effectiveness. To address this, we propose TypeTest, a novel framework that enhances type correctness in test generation through a vector-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. TypeTest employs call instance retrieval and feature-based retrieval to infer parameter types accurately and construct valid test inputs. Furthermore, it utilizes the call graph to extract richer contextual information, enabling more accurate assertion generation. In addition, TypeTest incorporates a repair mechanism and iterative test generation, progressively refining test cases to improve coverage. In an evaluation on 125 real-world Python modules, TypeTest achieved an average statement coverage of 86.6% and branch coverage of 76.8%, outperforming state-of-theart tools by 5.4% and 9.3%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The rewritings are usually achieved via transformation rules, but these rules are limited in scope and difficult to update in a production system. Recently, LLM-based techniques have also been suggested, but they are prone to semantic and syntactic errors. We investigate here how the remarkable cognitive capabilities of LLMs can be leveraged for performant query rewriting while incorporating safeguards and optimizations to ensure correctness and efficiency. Our study shows that these goals can be progressively achieved through incorporation of (a) an ensemble suite of basic prompts, (b) database-sensitive prompts via redundancy removal and selectivity-based rewriting rules, and (c) LLM token probability-guided rewrite paths. Further, a suite of logic-based and statistical tools can be used to check for semantic violations in the rewrites prior to DBA consideration. We have implemented the above LLM-infused techniques in the LITHE system, and evaluated complex analytic queries from standard benchmarks on contemporary database platforms. The results show significant performance improvements for slow queries, with regard to both abstract costing and actual execution, over both SOTA techniques and the native query optimizer. For instance, with TPC-DS on PostgreSQL, the geometric mean of the runtime speedups for slow queries was as high as 18.4 over the native optimizer, whereas SOTA delivered 6 in comparison. Overall, LITHE is a promising step toward viable LLM-based advisory tools for ameliorating enterprise query performance.</p></details> |  |

Decision-making games, which inherently require multifaceted reasoning logic, serve as ideal sandboxes for evaluating and enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this work, we first explore whether LLMs can master complex decision-making games through targeted post-training. To this end, we design data synthesis strategies and curate extensive offline datasets from two classic games, Doudizhu and Go. We further develop a suite of techniques to effectively incorporate this data into LLM training, resulting in two novel agents: Mastermind-Dou and Mastermind-Go. Our experimental results demonstrate that these Mastermind LLMs achieve competitive performance in their respective games. Additionally, we explore whether integrating decision-making data can enhance the general reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings suggest that such post-training improves certain aspects of reasoning, providing valuable insights for optimizing LLM data collection and synthesis strategies.</p></details> |  |

This limitation in grounding -- the process by which conversation participants establish mutual understanding -- can lead to outcomes ranging from frustrated users to serious consequences in high-stakes scenarios. To systematically study grounding challenges in human-LLM interactions, we analyze logs from three human-assistant datasets: WildChat, MultiWOZ, and Bing Chat. We develop a taxonomy of grounding acts and build models to annotate and forecast grounding behavior. Our findings reveal significant differences in human-human and human-LLM grounding: LLMs were three times less likely to initiate clarification and sixteen times less likely to provide follow-up requests than humans. Additionally, early grounding failures predicted later interaction breakdowns. Building on these insights, we introduce RIFTS: a benchmark derived from publicly available LLM interaction data containing situations where LLMs fail to initiate grounding. We note that current frontier models perform poorly on RIFTS, highlighting the need to reconsider how we train and prompt LLMs for human interaction. To this end, we develop a preliminary intervention that mitigates grounding failures.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

PnP Langevin sampling algorithms offer a powerful framework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as well as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and visualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model parameter tuning. However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |

However, the current implementation of UDC causes serious degradation. The incident light required for camera imaging undergoes attenuation and diffraction when passing through the display panel, leading to various artifacts in UDC imaging. Presently, the prevailing UDC image restoration methods predominantly utilize convolutional neural network architectures, whereas Transformer-based methods have exhibited superior performance in the majority of image restoration tasks. This is attributed to the Transformer's capability to sample global features for the local reconstruction of images, thereby achieving high-quality image restoration. In this paper, we observe that when using the Vision Transformer for UDC degraded image restoration, the global attention samples a large amount of redundant information and noise. Furthermore, compared to the ordinary Transformer employing dense attention, the Transformer utilizing sparse attention can alleviate the adverse impact of redundant information and noise. Building upon this discovery, we propose a Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer method (SGSFormer) for the task of restoring high-quality images from UDC degraded images. Specifically, we utilize sparse self-attention to filter out redundant information and noise, directing the model's attention to focus on the features more relevant to the degraded regions in need of reconstruction. Moreover, we integrate the instance segmentation map as prior information to guide the sparse self-attention in filtering and focusing on the correct regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, conference or other essential info</p></details> |

However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images. We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next, we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects, achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, most existing methods address only a single type of degradation (e.g., blur, noise, or haze) at a time, limiting their real-world applicability where multiple degradations often occur simultaneously. In this paper, we propose UniCoRN, a unified image restoration approach capable of handling multiple degradation types simultaneously using a multi-head diffusion model. Specifically, we uncover the potential of low-level visual cues extracted from images in guiding a controllable diffusion model for real-world image restoration and we design a multi-head control network adaptable via a mixture-of-experts strategy. We train our model without any prior assumption of specific degradations, through a smartly designed curriculum learning recipe. Additionally, we also introduce MetaRestore, a metalens imaging benchmark containing images with multiple degradations and artifacts. Extensive evaluations on several challenging datasets, including our benchmark, demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gains and can robustly restore images with severe degradations.

In this work, we tackle image restoration from a different perspective by jointly denoising multiple photographs of the same scene. Our core hypothesis is that degraded images capturing a shared scene contain complementary information that, when combined, better constrains the restoration problem. To this end, we implement a powerful multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates uncorrupted views by extracting rich information from multi-view relationships. Our experiments show that our multi-view approach outperforms existing single-view image and even video-based methods on image deblurring and super-resolution tasks. Critically, our model is trained to output 3D consistent images, making it a promising tool for applications requiring robust multi-view integration, such as 3D reconstruction or pose estimation.</p></details> |  |

The structure of the perturbations is investigated depending on the acceptable PSNR values and based on the Fourier power spectrum computations for the perturbations. It is demonstrated that moderate variation of image brightness ($\sim 10$ pixel units in a restricted region of an image can result in VMAF growth by $\sim 60\%$). Unlike some other methods demonstrating similar VMAF growth, the subjective quality of an image remains almost unchanged. It is also shown that the adversarial perturbations may demonstrate approximately linear dependence of perturbation amplitudes on the image brightness. The perturbations are studied based on the direct VMAF optimization in PyTorch. The significant discrepancies between the metric values and subjective judgements are also demonstrated when image restoration from noise is carried out using the same direct VMAF optimization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 40 figures |

Specifically, PPTformer contains two parts: an Image Restoration Network (IRNet) for restoring images from degraded observations and a Parser-Prompted Feature Generation Network (PPFGNet) for providing IRNet with reliable parser information to boost restoration. To enhance the integration of the parser within IRNet, we propose Intra Parser-Prompted Attention (IntraPPA) and Inter Parser-Prompted Attention (InterPPA) to implicitly and explicitly learn useful parser features to facilitate restoration. The IntraPPA re-considers cross attention between parser and restoration features, enabling implicit perception of the parser from a long-range and intra-layer perspective. Conversely, the InterPPA initially fuses restoration features with those of the parser, followed by formulating these fused features within an attention mechanism to explicitly perceive parser information. Further, we propose a parser-prompted feed-forward network to guide restoration within pixel-wise gating modulation. Experimental results show that PPTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on image deraining, defocus deblurring, desnowing, and low-light enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is accepted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

However, rapid scans often result in poor image quality, potentially affecting diagnosis due to reduced resolution and detail, which make it challenging to identify and evaluate finer anatomical structures. To address this issue, we propose the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance rapid bone scintigraphy images in pediatric populations. Our method comprises two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, augmented by three key modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules incorporate domain-specific semantic information from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM maintains consistent semantic feature representation throughout the cascaded networks. In addition, we will release a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset called RBS, the first dataset dedicated to rapid bone scintigraphy image restoration in pediatric patients. RBS consists of 137 pediatric patients aged between 0.5 and 16 years who underwent both standard and rapid bone scans. The dataset includes scans performed at 20 cm/min (standard) and 40 cm/min (rapid), representing a $2\times$ acceleration. We conducted extensive experiments on both the publicly available endoscopic dataset and RBS. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing methods across various metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, FID, and LPIPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

To cope with these challenges, we analyze the restoration process in depth through a progressive spectral perspective, and deconstruct the complex UHD restoration problem into three progressive stages: zero-frequency enhancement, low-frequency restoration, and high-frequency refinement. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, ERR, which comprises three collaborative sub-networks: the zero-frequency enhancer (ZFE), the low-frequency restorer (LFR), and the high-frequency refiner (HFR). Specifically, the ZFE integrates global priors to learn global mapping, while the LFR restores low-frequency information, emphasizing reconstruction of coarse-grained content. Finally, the HFR employs our designed frequency-windowed kolmogorov-arnold networks (FW-KAN) to refine textures and details, producing high-quality image restoration. Our approach significantly outperforms previous UHD methods across various tasks, with extensive ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we introduce ABAIR, a simple yet effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration model that not only handles multiple degradations and generalizes well to unseen distortions but also efficiently integrates new degradations by training only a small subset of parameters. We first train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations. To enhance its ability to recognize distortions, we incorporate a segmentation head that estimates per-pixel degradation types. Second, we adapt our initial model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. This specialize-then-merge approach is both powerful in addressing specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks. Moreover, our model not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance on five- and three-task IR setups but also demonstrates superior generalization to unseen degradations and composite distortions.</p></details> | 17 pages |

While many specialized and all-in-one IR models have been developed, they fail to effectively handle complex, mixed degradations. Recent agentic methods RestoreAgent and AgenticIR leverage intelligent, autonomous workflows to alleviate this issue, yet they suffer from suboptimal results and inefficiency due to their resource-intensive finetunings, and ineffective searches and tool execution trials for satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose MAIR, a novel Multi-Agent approach for complex IR problems. We introduce a real-world degradation prior, categorizing degradations into three types: (1) scene, (2) imaging, and (3) compression, which are observed to occur sequentially in real world, and reverse them in the opposite order. Built upon this three-stage restoration framework, MAIR emulates a team of collaborative human specialists, including a "scheduler" for overall planning and multiple "experts" dedicated to specific degradations. This design minimizes search space and trial efforts, improving image quality while reducing inference costs. In addition, a registry mechanism is introduced to enable easy integration of new tools. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that proposed MAIR achieves competitive performance and improved efficiency over the previous agentic IR system.

Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space. However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks with only 1M parameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional scanners achieve this by scanning at multiple focal planes of varying depths and then merging them, which is relatively slow and often struggles with complex tissue defocus. Recent prevailing image restoration technique provides a means to restore high-quality pathology images from scans of single focal planes. However, existing image restoration methods are inadequate, due to intricate defocus patterns in pathology images and their domain-specific semantic complexities. In this work, we devise a two-stage restoration solution cascading a transformer and a diffusion model, to benefit from their powers in preserving image fidelity and perceptual quality, respectively. We particularly propose a novel mixture of prompts for the two-stage solution. Given initial prompt that models defocus in microscopic imaging, we design two prompts that describe the high-level image semantics from pathology foundation model and the fine-grained tissue structures via edge extraction. We demonstrate that, by feeding the prompt mixture to our method, we can restore high-quality pathology images from single-focal-plane scans, implying high potentials of the mixture of prompts to clinical usage.

These problems present unique structural challenges that differ from existing benchmarks, arising from critical scientific applications such as optical tomography, medical imaging, black hole imaging, seismology, and fluid dynamics. With \textsc{InverseBench}, we benchmark 14 inverse problem algorithms that use plug-and-play diffusion priors against strong, domain-specific baselines, offering valuable new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms.

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance.

This leads to insufficient interaction for unprofessional users and limits their restoration capability for complicated real-world applications. In this work, we present HybridAgent, intending to incorporate multiple restoration modes into a unified image restoration model and achieve intelligent and efficient user interaction through our proposed hybrid agents. Concretely, we propose the hybrid rule of fast, slow, and feedback restoration agents. Here, the slow restoration agent optimizes the powerful multimodal large language model (MLLM) with our proposed instruction-tuning dataset to identify degradations within images with ambiguous user prompts and invokes proper restoration tools accordingly. The fast restoration agent is designed based on a lightweight large language model (LLM) via in-context learning to understand the user prompts with simple and clear requirements, which can obviate the unnecessary time/resource costs of MLLM. Moreover, we introduce the mixed distortion removal mode for our HybridAgents, which is crucial but not concerned in previous agent-based works. It can effectively prevent the error propagation of step-by-step image restoration and largely improve the efficiency of the agent system. We validate the effectiveness of HybridAgent with both synthetic and real-world IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, images captured by diverse sensors often encounter various degradations that can negatively affect fusion quality. Traditional fusion methods generally treat image enhancement and fusion as separate processes, overlooking the inherent correlation between them; notably, the dominant regions in one modality of a fused image often indicate areas where the other modality might benefit from enhancement. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the concept of dominant regions for image enhancement and present a Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent framework for Image Fusion (Dream-IF). This framework quantifies the relative dominance of each modality across different layers and leverages this information to facilitate reciprocal cross-modal enhancement. By integrating the relative dominance derived from image fusion, our approach supports not only image restoration but also a broader range of image enhancement applications. Furthermore, we employ prompt-based encoding to capture degradation-specific details, which dynamically steer the restoration process and promote coordinated enhancement in both multi-modal image fusion and image enhancement scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Dream-IF consistently outperforms its counterparts.</p></details> |  |

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of No-Reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders the assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (Cross-Reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new Cross-Reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate Cross-Reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose MP-HSIR, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an innovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key components: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related information and context-aware representations into the network to guide restoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable input-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving adaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism, after the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge with constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free concepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration process. Therefore, we can form a cyclic "Prompt-Restore-Prompt" pipeline that adeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable textures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at: https://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework that addresses these challenges. By incorporating frequency-aware feature modulation, which utilizes frequency analysis to narrow down the restoration search space and employing vision-language model (VLM)-guided prompt learning, our approach decomposes text prompts into intensity and bias controllers that effectively guide the restoration process while mitigating domain discrepancies.

Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradation specific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms state-of-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/mrluin/UniRestorer.</p></details> | 30 pages, 20 figures |

Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches struggle with addressing complex and ambiguously defined degradation types. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic degradation decomposition network for all-in-one image restoration, named D$^3$Net. D$^3$Net achieves degradation-adaptive image restoration with guided prompt through cross-domain interaction and dynamic degradation decomposition. Concretely, in D$^3$Net, the proposed Cross-Domain Degradation Analyzer (CDDA) engages in deep interaction between frequency domain degradation characteristics and spatial domain image features to identify and model variations of different degradation types on the image manifold, generating degradation correction prompt and strategy prompt, which guide the following decomposition process. Furthermore, the prompt-based Dynamic Decomposition Mechanism (DDM) for progressive degradation decomposition, that encourages the network to adaptively select restoration strategies utilizing the two-level prompt generated by CDDA. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation between CDDA and DDM, D$^3$Net achieves superior flexibility and scalability in handling unknown degradation, while effectively reducing unnecessary computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple image restoration tasks demonstrate that D$^3$Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, especially improving PSNR by 5.47dB and 3.30dB on the SOTS-Outdoor and GoPro datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Our evaluation reveals a critical gap: existing approaches consistently fail on severely degraded videos--precisely where diffusion models' generative capabilities are most needed. We identify that existing diffusion-based VSR methods struggle primarily because they face an overwhelming learning burden: simultaneously modeling complex degradation distributions, content representations, and temporal relationships with limited high-quality training data. To address this fundamental challenge, we present DiffVSR, featuring a Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS) that systematically decomposes this learning burden through staged training, enabling superior performance on complex degradations. Our framework additionally incorporates an Interweaved Latent Transition (ILT) technique that maintains competitive temporal consistency without additional training overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in scenarios where competing methods struggle, particularly on severely degraded videos. Our work reveals that addressing the learning strategy, rather than focusing solely on architectural complexity, is the critical path toward robust real-world video super-resolution with diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xh9998.github.io/DiffVSR-project/</p></details> |

They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.

Under such scenarios, traditional frame-based cameras may fail to capture the structure and color information due to the exposure time limitation. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event cameras' high dynamic range is pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing traditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments. In this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional frame-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that combine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based low-light image restoration framework named ERetinex. Among our contributions, the first is developing a new approach that leverages the high temporal resolution data from event cameras with traditional image information to estimate scene illumination accurately. This method outperforms traditional image-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more precise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion strategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the color information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this fusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the integrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a gain of 1.0613 dB in PSNR while reducing FLOPS by \textbf{84.28}\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, this enhanced contrast comes at the cost of system complexity, constrained by an inherent trade-off between spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and imaging speed. To overcome this limitation, we present a deep learning-based approach that restores and enhances pixel resolution post-acquisition without any a priori knowledge. Fine-tuned using metrics aligned with the imaging model, our physics-aware method achieves a 16X pixel super-resolution enhancement and a 12X imaging speedup without the need of additional training data for transfer learning. Applied to both synthetic and experimental data from five different sample types, we demonstrate that the model preserves biological integrity, ensuring no features are lost or hallucinated. We also concretely demonstrate the model's ability to reveal disease-associated metabolic changes in Downs syndrome that would otherwise remain undetectable. Furthermore, we provide physical insights into the inner workings of the model, paving the way for future refinements that could potentially surpass instrumental limits in an explainable manner. All methods are available as open-source software on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Most existing deweathering methods rely on increasing the network scale and data volume to achieve better performance which requires more expensive computing power. Also, many methods lack generalization for specific applications. In the traffic surveillance screener, the main challenges are snow removal and veil effect elimination. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-enhanced snow removal method that use a Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform feature enhancement module and a dynamic convolution acceleration module to address snow degradation in surveillance images. We also use a residual learning restoration module to remove veil effects caused by rain, snow, and fog. The proposed architecture extracts and analyzes information from snow-covered regions, significantly improving snow removal performance. And the residual learning restoration module removes veiling effects in images, enhancing clarity and detail. Experiments show that it performs better than some popular desnowing methods. Our approach also demonstrates effectiveness and accuracy when applied to real traffic surveillance images.</p></details> |  |

More recently, a sampling-based variant of this approach, which utilizes a pre-trained \textit{generative diffusion model}, has gained great popularity for solving IR problems through stochastic sampling. The IR results using PnP with a pre-trained diffusion model demonstrate distinct advantages compared to those using discriminative denoisers, \ie improved perceptual quality while sacrificing the data fidelity. The unsatisfactory results are due to the lack of integration of these strategies in the IR tasks. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot IR scheme, dubbed Reconciling Diffusion Model in Dual (RDMD), which leverages only a \textbf{single} pre-trained diffusion model to construct \textbf{two} complementary regularizers. Specifically, the diffusion model in RDMD will iteratively perform deterministic denoising and stochastic sampling, aiming to achieve high-fidelity image restoration with appealing perceptual quality. RDMD also allows users to customize the distortion-perception tradeoff with a single hyperparameter, enhancing the adaptability of the restoration process in different practical scenarios. Extensive experiments on several IR tasks demonstrate that our proposed method could achieve superior results compared to existing approaches on both the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Moreover, typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of this algorithm and discuss its practical benefit.</p></details> |  |

These models can serve as strong priors for image restoration. Existing methods often utilize techniques like ControlNet to sample high quality images with low quality images from these priors. However, ControlNet typically involves copying a large part of the original network, resulting in a significantly large number of parameters as the prior scales up. In this paper, we propose a relatively lightweight Adapter that leverages the powerful generative capabilities of pretrained priors to achieve photo-realistic image restoration. The Adapters can be adapt to both denoising UNet and DiT, and performs excellent.</p></details> |  |

Accurately quantifying this uncertainty is essential for the reliable interpretation of reconstructed images. However, image restoration methods often lack uncertainty quantification capabilities. Conformal prediction offers a rigorous framework to augment image restoration methods with accurate uncertainty quantification estimates, but it typically requires abundant ground truth data for calibration. This paper presents a self-supervised conformal prediction method for Poisson imaging problems which leverages Poisson Unbiased Risk Estimator to eliminate the need for ground truth data. The resulting self-calibrating conformal prediction approach is applicable to any Poisson linear imaging problem that is ill-conditioned, and is particularly effective when combined with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques trained directly on measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring; its performance are comparable to supervised conformal prediction methods relying on ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most convolutional neural network-based methods typically focus on a single scale, neglecting the incorporation of multi-scale information. In image restoration tasks, local features of an image are often insufficient, necessitating the integration of global features to complement them. Although recent neural network algorithms have made significant strides in feature extraction, many models do not explicitly model global features or consider the relationship between global and local features. This paper proposes multi-level attention-guided graph neural network. The proposed network explicitly constructs element block graphs and element graphs within feature maps using multi-attention mechanisms to extract both local structural features and global representation information of the image. Since the network struggles to effectively extract global information during image degradation, the structural information of local feature blocks can be used to correct and supplement the global information. Similarly, when element block information in the feature map is missing, it can be refined using global element representation information. The graph within the network learns real-time dynamic connections through the multi-attention mechanism, and information is propagated and aggregated via graph convolution algorithms. By combining local element block information and global element representation information from the feature map, the algorithm can more effectively restore missing information in the image. Experimental results on several classic image restoration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Building on the insight that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new dual-transformer approach comprising two components: a frequency-aware Degradation estimation transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing the input into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in five representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring, and low-light enhancement. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling, real-world degradations, spatially variant degradations, and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics.

The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025.

Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Restoration can be seen as a controllable generation conditioning on priors. However, due to the severity of image degradation, existing diffusion-based restoration methods cannot fully exploit priors from low-quality images and still have many challenges in perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and structure accuracy. Based on the challenges, we introduce a novel image restoration method, SSP-IR. Our approach aims to fully exploit semantic and structure priors from low-quality images to guide the diffusion model in generating semantically faithful and structurally accurate natural restoration results. Specifically, we integrate the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (explicit) and the visual representations of the original image (implicit) to acquire accurate semantic prior. To extract degradation-independent structure prior, we introduce a Processor with RGB and FFT constraints to extract structure prior from the low-quality images, guiding the diffusion model and preventing the generation of unreasonable artifacts. Lastly, we employ a multi-level attention mechanism to integrate the acquired semantic and structure priors. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods overall on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo are available at https://ddcm-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for reliably interpreting experimental results, particularly when reconstructed images inform critical decisions and science. However, most existing image restoration methods either fail to quantify uncertainty or provide estimates that are highly inaccurate. Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a flexible framework to equip any estimator with uncertainty quantification capabilities that, by construction, have nearly exact marginal coverage. To achieve this, conformal prediction relies on abundant ground truth data for calibration. However, in image restoration problems, reliable ground truth data is often expensive or not possible to acquire. Also, reliance on ground truth data can introduce large biases in situations of distribution shift between calibration and deployment. This paper seeks to develop a more robust approach to conformal prediction for image restoration problems by proposing a self-supervised conformal prediction method that leverages Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to self-calibrate itself directly from the observed noisy measurements, bypassing the need for ground truth. The method is suitable for any linear imaging inverse problem that is ill-conditioned, and it is especially powerful when used with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques that can also be trained directly from measurement data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring, where it delivers results that are remarkably accurate and comparable to those obtained by supervised conformal prediction with ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing image compression methods are tailored for clean images, therefore struggling to achieve satisfying results on these images. Joint compression and restoration methods typically focus on a single type of degradation and fail to address a variety of degradations in practice. To this end, we propose a unified framework for all-in-one image compression and restoration, which incorporates the image restoration capability against various degradations into the process of image compression. The key challenges involve distinguishing authentic image content from degradations, and flexibly eliminating various degradations without prior knowledge. Specifically, the proposed framework approaches these challenges from two perspectives: i.e., content information aggregation, and degradation representation aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior rate-distortion (RD) performance on various degraded inputs while preserving the performance on clean data; 2) strong generalization ability to real-world and unseen scenarios; 3) higher computing efficiency over compared methods.

However, these methods are hindered by their substantial size and computational demands, rendering them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR operates in latent space by first predicting the latent representation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and then transporting this estimate to high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. Consequently, ELIR is more than 4x faster compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches. Moreover, ELIR is also more than 4x smaller, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks show that ELIR achieves competitive results, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while offering improved efficiency in terms of memory and computation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

Toward this end, we present MorphoMod, a novel method for automated visible watermark removal that operates in a blind setting -- without requiring target images. Unlike existing methods, MorphoMod effectively removes opaque and transparent watermarks while preserving semantic content, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including the Colored Large-scale Watermark Dataset (CLWD), LOGO-series, and the newly introduced Alpha1 datasets, demonstrate that MorphoMod achieves up to a 50.8% improvement in watermark removal effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the impact of prompts used for inpainting, pre-removal filling strategies, and inpainting model performance on watermark removal. Additionally, a case study on steganographic disorientation reveals broader applications for watermark removal in disrupting high-level hidden messages. MorphoMod offers a robust, adaptable solution for watermark removal and opens avenues for further advancements in image restoration and adversarial manipulation.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Traditional ``Shape from X'' tasks usually use visual input (e.g., RGB images or depth maps) to reconstruct geometry, imposing strict constraints that limit creative explorations. As applications, works like Shadow Art and Wire Art often struggle to grasp the embedded semantics of their design through direct observation and rely heavily on specific setups for proper display. To address these limitations, our framework uses semantics as input, greatly expanding the design space to create objects that integrate multiple semantic elements and are easily discernible by observers. Considering that this task requires a rich imagination, we adopt various generative models and structure-to-detail pipelines. Specifically, we adopt multi-semantics Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill 3D geometry and appearance from 2D diffusion models, ensuring that the initial shape is consistent with the semantic input. We then use image restoration and video generation models to add more details as supervision. Finally, we introduce neural signed distance field (SDF) representation to achieve detailed shape reconstruction.

By replacing the spatial self-attention layer with the proposed short-long-range (SLR) temporal attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy to improve temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance.

Recently, Mamba models have made a splash in the field of computer vision due to their ability to handle long-range dependencies and their significant computational efficiency compared to Transformers. However, Mamba currently lags behind Transformers in contextual learning capabilities. To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data. In the Transformer module, we combine triangular window-based local attention with channel-based global attention to effectively activate the attention mechanism over a wider range of image pixels.

However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information. The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction. SFIM's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments across three UDC benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body (10 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables), References (3 pages), Appendix (8 pages, 6 Figures, 6 Tables)</p></details> |

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception Block} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmarks for image super-resolution, deraining, and low-light image enhancement demonstrate that TAMambaIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency, establishing it as a robust and efficient framework for image restoration.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.</p></details> |  |

Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color artifacts in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a balance of regularization terms on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color artifacts reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,14figures |

Unlike the existing self-supervised pre-training methods, DCPT utilizes the degradation type of the input image as an extremely weak supervision, which can be effortlessly obtained, even intrinsic in all image restoration datasets. DCPT comprises two primary stages. Initially, image features are extracted from the encoder. Subsequently, a lightweight decoder, such as ResNet18, is leveraged to classify the degradation type of the input image solely based on the features extracted in the first stage, without utilizing the input image. The encoder is pre-trained with a straightforward yet potent DCPT, which is used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Following DCPT, both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrate performance improvements, with gains of up to 2.55 dB in the 10D all-in-one restoration task and 6.53 dB in the mixed degradation scenarios. Moreover, previous self-supervised pretraining methods, such as masked image modeling, discard the decoder after pre-training, while our DCPT utilizes the pre-trained parameters more effectively. This superiority arises from the degradation classifier acquired during DCPT, which facilitates transfer learning between models of identical architecture trained on diverse degradation types.

Existing studies have focused on specific restoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure correction where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and severity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors.

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

While denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated notable success in tasks like image synthesis and restoration, traditional DDPMs rely on continuous data representations and mean squared error (MSE) loss for training, applying Gaussian noise models that may not be optimal for discrete or binary data structures. BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets. Notably, BDPM requires fewer inference steps than traditional DDPM models to reach optimal results, showcasing enhanced inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[INDIGO+: A Unified INN-Guided Probabilistic Diffusion Algorithm for Blind and Non-Blind Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14014v1)** | 2025-01-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.14014v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models are becoming one of the most popular prior in image restoration (IR) tasks due to their remarkable ability to generate realistic natural images. Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Existing dehazing models often neglect compression effects, which limits their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions. First, we design FDG-Diff, a novel frequency-domain-guided dehazing framework that improves JPEG image restoration by leveraging frequency-domain information. Second, we introduce the High-Frequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequency-domain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the Degradation-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive region-specific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation inconsistencies in compressed hazy images. Experimental results across multiple compressed dehazing datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches.

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Serpent: Scalable and Efficient Image Restoration via Multi-scale Structured State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17902v3)** | 2025-01-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2403.17902v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> |  |

This task is typically addressed while being given only degraded images, without their corresponding ground-truth versions. In this hard setting, designing and evaluating restoration algorithms becomes highly challenging. This paper offers a suite of tools that can serve both the design and assessment of real-world image restoration algorithms. Our work starts by proposing a trained model that predicts the chain of degradations a given real-world measured input has gone through. We show how this estimator can be used to approximate the consistency -- the match between the measurements and any proposed recovered image. We also use this estimator as a guiding force for the design of a simple and highly-effective plug-and-play real-world image restoration algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained diffusion-based image prior. Furthermore, this work proposes no-reference proxy measures of MSE and LPIPS, which, without access to the ground-truth images, allow ranking of real-world image restoration algorithms according to their (approximate) MSE and LPIPS. The proposed suite provides a versatile, first of its kind framework for evaluating and comparing blind image restoration algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://man-sean.github.io/elad-website/</p></details> |

Diffusion models are the newcomers to this arena, posing the strongest known prior to date. Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of image restoration tasks and datasets, achieving significant improvements over prior art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://ronraphaeli.github.io/SILO-website/</p></details> |

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

The application of DM in stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need to reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally, existing latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove high-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is precisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we propose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image restoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo first learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is then trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are fused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing beneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The resolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the inherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates the computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding scheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling distinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network. Comprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and transformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information.

However, their high computational complexity-manifested in elevated FLOPs and parameter counts-limits their application in real-world scenarios. Existing knowledge distillation methods in image restoration typically employ lightweight student models that directly mimic the intermediate features and reconstruction results of the teacher, overlooking the implicit attention relationships between them. To address this, we propose a Soft Knowledge Distillation (SKD) strategy that incorporates a Multi-dimensional Cross-net Attention (MCA) mechanism for compressing image restoration models. This mechanism facilitates interaction between the student and teacher across both channel and spatial dimensions, enabling the student to implicitly learn the attention matrices. Additionally, we employ a Gaussian kernel function to measure the distance between student and teacher features in kernel space, ensuring stable and efficient feature learning. To further enhance the quality of reconstructed images, we replace the commonly used L1 or KL divergence loss with a contrastive learning loss at the image level. Experiments on three tasks-image deraining, deblurring, and denoising-demonstrate that our SKD strategy significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining strong image restoration capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

However, its potential in image-to-image translation, particularly in image restoration, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a Simultaneous Learning Knowledge Distillation (SLKD) framework tailored for model compression in image restoration tasks. SLKD employs a dual-teacher, single-student architecture with two distinct learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and Image Reconstruction Learning (IRL), simultaneously. In DRL, the student encoder learns from Teacher A to focus on removing degradation factors, guided by a novel BRISQUE extractor. In IRL, the student decoder learns from Teacher B to reconstruct clean images, with the assistance of a proposed PIQE extractor. These strategies enable the student to learn from degraded and clean images simultaneously, ensuring high-quality compression of image restoration models. Experimental results across five datasets and three tasks demonstrate that SLKD achieves substantial reductions in FLOPs and parameters, exceeding 80\%, while maintaining strong image restoration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

Previous studies focus on restoring either color or the geometry, but to our best knowledge, not both. However, in practice it may be cumbersome to address the two rectifications one-by-one. In this paper, we propose NeuroPump, a self-supervised method to simultaneously optimize and rectify underwater geometry and color as if water were pumped out. The key idea is to explicitly model refraction, absorption and scattering in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipeline, such that it not only performs simultaneous geometric and color rectification, but also enables to synthesize novel views and optical effects by controlling the decoupled parameters. In addition, to address issue of lack of real paired ground truth images, we propose an underwater 360 benchmark dataset that has real paired (i.e., with and without water) images.

Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing.

However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

Such fixed points appear in a class of DNNs when dimensions of input and output vectors are the same. We demonstrate examples of applications of such networks in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning such as encoding/decoding of images, restoration of damaged images among others. We present several numerical and analytical results. First, we show that for untrained DNN's with weights and biases initialized by normally distributed random variables the only one fixed point exists. This result holds for DNN with any depth (number of layers) $L$, any layer width $N$, and sigmoid-type activation functions. Second, it has been shown that for a DNN whose parameters (weights and biases) are initialized by ``light-tailed'' distribution of weights (e.g. normal distribution), after training the distribution of these parameters become ``heavy-tailed''. This motivates our study of DNNs with ``heavy-tailed'' initialization. For such DNNs we show numerically %existence and stability that training leads to emergence of $Q(N,L)$ fixed points, where $Q(N,L)$ is a positive integer which depends on the number of layers $L$ and layer width $N$. We further observe numerically that for fixed $N = N_0$ the function $Q(N_0, L)$ is non-monotone, that is it initially grows as $L$ increases and then decreases to 1. This non-monotone behavior of $Q(N_0, L)$ is also obtained by analytical derivation of equation for Empirical Spectral Distribution (ESD) of input-output Jacobian followed by numerical solution of this equation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

The recent advent of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model in the natural language processing field has attracted much attention due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D medical images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Even a lightweight variant of Restore-RWKV, with only 1.16 million parameters, achieves comparable or even superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting Restore-RWKV achieves SOTA performance across a range of medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, MRI image super-resolution, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Color Balance Prior \textbf{Guided} \textbf{Hyb}rid \textbf{Sens}e \textbf{U}nderwater \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration framework (\textbf{GuidedHybSensUIR}). This framework operates on multiple scales, employing the proposed \textbf{Detail Restorer} module to restore low-level detailed features at finer scales and utilizing the proposed \textbf{Feature Contextualizer} module to capture long-range contextual relations of high-level general features at a broader scale. The hybridization of these different scales of sensing results effectively addresses color casts and restores blurry details. In order to effectively point out the evolutionary direction for the model, we propose a novel \textbf{Color Balance Prior} as a strong guide in the feature contextualization step and as a weak guide in the final decoding phase. We construct a comprehensive benchmark using paired training data from three real-world underwater datasets and evaluate on six test sets, including three paired and three unpaired, sourced from four real-world underwater datasets. Subsequently, we tested 14 traditional and retrained 23 deep learning existing underwater image restoration methods on this benchmark, obtaining metric results for each approach. This effort aims to furnish a valuable benchmarking dataset for standard basis for comparison. The extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms 37 other state-of-the-art methods overall on various benchmark datasets and metrics, despite not achieving the best results in certain individual cases.

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Image Restoration Using Few-Step Guidance of Consistency Models (and Beyond)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20596v1)** | 2024-12-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.20596v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, it has become popular to tackle image restoration tasks with a single pretrained diffusion model (DM) and data-fidelity guidance, instead of training a dedicated deep neural network per task. However, such "zero-shot" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at: https://github.com/tirer-lab/CM4IR</p></details> |

We propose DreamTexture, a novel Shape-from-Virtual-Texture approach that leverages monocular depth cues to reconstruct 3D objects. Our method textures an input image by aligning a virtual texture with the real depth cues in the input, exploiting the inherent understanding of monocular geometry encoded in modern diffusion models. We then reconstruct depth from the virtual texture deformation with a new conformal map optimization, which alleviates memory-intensive volumetric representations. Our experiments reveal that generative models possess an understanding of monocular shape cues, which can be extracted by augmenting and aligning texture cues -- a novel monocular reconstruction paradigm that we call Analysis by Augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://anantarb.github.io/dreamtexture/</p></details> |

VerbDiff is a novel text-to-image generation model that weakens the bias between interaction words and objects, enhancing the understanding of interactions. Specifically, we disentangle various interaction words from frequency-based anchor words and leverage localized interaction regions from generated images to help the model better capture semantics in distinctive words without extra conditions. Our approach enables the model to accurately understand the intended interaction between humans and objects, producing high-quality images with accurate interactions aligned with specified verbs.

However, inference-time scaling has received less attention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation attempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of "golden noises" that can enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that guiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise candidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the current step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing the anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term value. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible adjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step denoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant long-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a plug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial noises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency and visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert initial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value, leveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover, to preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution that up-weights promising noises. In this way, ScalingNoise significantly reduces noise-induced errors, ensuring more coherent and spatiotemporally consistent video generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ScalingNoise effectively improves long video generation.</p></details> |  |

In more detail, SwD is inspired by the recent insights relating diffusion processes to the implicit spectral autoregression. We suppose that DMs can initiate generation at lower data resolutions and gradually upscale the samples at each denoising step without loss in performance while significantly reducing computational costs. SwD naturally integrates this idea into existing diffusion distillation methods based on distribution matching. Also, we enrich the family of distribution matching approaches by introducing a novel patch loss enforcing finer-grained similarity to the target distribution. When applied to state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models, SwD approaches the inference times of two full resolution steps and significantly outperforms the counterparts under the same computation budget, as evidenced by automated metrics and human preference studies.</p></details> |  |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gain by SV4D 2.0 both visually and quantitatively, achieving better detail (-14\% LPIPS) and 4D consistency (-44\% FV4D) in novel-view video synthesis and 4D optimization (-12\% LPIPS and -24\% FV4D) compared to SV4D.

By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot. Notably, we claim that M3 is the first work to address the core compression challenges in 3D feature distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 homepage: https://m3-spatial-memory.github.io code: https://github.com/MaureenZOU/m3-spatial</p></details> |

Yet, without vast amounts of spatial supervision, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle at this task. In this paper, we introduce TWIST & SCOUT, a framework that equips pre-trained MLLMs with visual grounding ability without forgetting their existing image and language understanding skills. To this end, we propose TWIST, a twin-expert stepwise tuning module that modifies the decoder of the language model using one frozen module pre-trained on image understanding tasks and another learnable one for visual grounding tasks. This allows the MLLM to retain previously learned knowledge and skills, while acquiring what is missing. To fine-tune the model effectively, we generate a high-quality synthetic dataset we call SCOUT, which mimics human reasoning in visual grounding. This dataset provides rich supervision signals, describing a step-by-step multimodal reasoning process, thereby simplifying the task of visual grounding. We evaluate our approach on several standard benchmark datasets, encompassing grounded image captioning, zero-shot localization, and visual grounding tasks. Our method consistently delivers strong performance across all tasks, while retaining the pre-trained image understanding capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a novel and efficient pose-driven attention-guided multimodal network (EPAM-Net) for action recognition in videos. Specifically, we propose eXpand temporal Shift (X-ShiftNet) convolutional architectures for RGB and pose streams to capture spatio-temporal features from RGB videos and their skeleton sequences. The X-ShiftNet tackles the high computational cost of the 3D CNNs by integrating the Temporal Shift Module (TSM) into an efficient 2D CNN, enabling efficient spatiotemporal learning. Then skeleton features are utilized to guide the visual network stream, focusing on keyframes and their salient spatial regions using the proposed spatial-temporal attention block. Finally, the predictions of the two streams are fused for final classification. The experimental results show that our method, with a significant reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs), outperforms and competes with the state-of-the-art methods on NTU RGB-D 60, NTU RGB-D 120, PKU-MMD, and Toyota SmartHome datasets. The proposed EPAM-Net provides up to a 72.8x reduction in FLOPs and up to a 48.6x reduction in the number of network parameters.

Existing unimodal datasets lack scale and diversity, limiting deep learning solutions. This paper proposes MapGlue, a universal MRSI matching framework, and MapData, a large-scale multimodal dataset addressing these gaps. Our contributions are twofold. MapData, a globally diverse dataset spanning 233 sampling points, offers original images (7,000x5,000 to 20,000x15,000 pixels). After rigorous cleaning, it provides 121,781 aligned electronic map-visible image pairs (512x512 pixels) with hybrid manual-automated ground truth, addressing the scarcity of scalable multimodal benchmarks. MapGlue integrates semantic context with a dual graph-guided mechanism to extract cross-modal invariant features. This structure enables global-to-local interaction, enhancing descriptor robustness against modality-specific distortions. Extensive evaluations on MapData and five public datasets demonstrate MapGlue's superiority in matching accuracy under complex conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MapGlue generalizes effectively to unseen modalities without retraining, highlighting its adaptability. This work addresses longstanding challenges in MRSI matching by combining scalable dataset construction with a robust, semantics-driven framework. Furthermore, MapGlue shows strong generalization capabilities on other modality matching tasks for which it was not specifically trained.

In this paper, we disclose that CLIP's vulnerabilities primarily stem from its excessive encoding of class-irrelevant features, which can compromise the model's visual feature resistivity to input perturbations, making it more susceptible to capturing the trigger patterns inserted by backdoor attacks. Inspired by this finding, we propose Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning (RVPT), a novel defense approach that employs specially designed deep visual prompt tuning and feature-repelling loss to eliminate excessive class-irrelevant features while simultaneously optimizing cross-entropy loss to maintain clean accuracy. Unlike existing multimodal backdoor defense methods that typically require the availability of poisoned data or involve fine-tuning the entire model, RVPT leverages few-shot downstream clean samples and only tunes a small number of parameters. Empirical results demonstrate that RVPT tunes only 0.27\% of the parameters relative to CLIP, yet it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing the attack success rate from 67.53\% to 2.76\% against SoTA attacks and effectively generalizing its defensive capabilities across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |

This process often involves multiple sequential and interconnected transformations, which must be well-documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the use of transformation trees as a method for structured recording and management of these transformations. This approach has been implemented in the dpVision software and uses a dedicated .dpw file format to store hierarchical relationships between images, transformations, and motion data. Transformation trees allow precise tracking of all image processing steps, reduce the need to store multiple copies of the same data, and enable the indirect registration of images that do not share common reference points. This improves the reproducibility of the analyses and facilitates later processing and integration of images from different sources. The practical application of this method is demonstrated with examples from orthodontics, including the integration of 3D face scans, intraoral scans, and CBCT images, as well as the documentation of mandibular motion. Beyond orthodontics, this method can be applied in other fields that require systematic management of image registration processes, such as maxillofacial surgery, oncology, and biomechanical analysis. Maintaining long-term data consistency is essential for both scientific research and clinical practice. It enables easier comparison of results in longitudinal studies, improves retrospective analysis, and supports the development of artificial intelligence algorithms by providing standardized and well-documented datasets. The proposed approach enhances data organization, allows for efficient analysis, and facilitates the reuse of information in future studies and diagnostic procedures.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |

While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been the predominant approach to enhance MLLM capabilities in task-specific optimization, it often falls short in fostering crucial generalized reasoning abilities. Despite the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to address these limitations, it faces two issues: (1) its generalized capabilities in multimodal tasks remain underexplored. (2) its training constraints such as constant Kullback-Leibler or clamp strategy easily lead to suboptimal bottleneck. To adress these issues, we introduce OThink-MR1, a framework that extends RL to MLLMs, enabling them to achieve deeper understanding and reasoning across multimodal tasks. We design a dynamic Kullback-Leibler strategy that significantly enhances RL performance, surpassing SFT in same-task evaluations. Also, we are the first to reveal that RL exhibits remarkable cross-task generalization capabilities, which shows that models post-trained with RL on one multimodal task can be effectively transfered to another tasks. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the great reasoning ability of our proposed OThink-MR1.</p></details> |  |

Recently, unified multimodal large models (MLLMs) for understanding and generation have sparked exploration within research community. Previous works attempt to train a unified image tokenizer by combining loss functions for semantic feature reconstruction and pixel reconstruction. However, due to the differing levels of features prioritized by multimodal understanding and generation tasks, joint training methods face significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses this challenge through Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook which builds texture sub-codebooks on pre-trained semantic codebook. This design decouples the training of semantic reconstruction and pixel reconstruction and equips the tokenizer with low-level texture feature extraction capability without degradation of high-level semantic feature extraction ability. Our experiments demonstrate that SemHiTok achieves excellent rFID score at 256X256resolution compared to other unified tokenizers, and exhibits competitive performance on multimodal understanding and generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review, Refer to the latest version</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</p></details> |  |

This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, a generalizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can incorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio, thermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality. It projects diverse modality features to the LLM token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types for response generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel progressive multimodal fusion design supported by a lightweight fusion module and modality-sequential training strategy. It helps compress information across various assisting modalities, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM while improving performance. We validate our method on 7 video-language reasoning tasks assisted by diverse modalities, including conventional VideoQA and Video-Audio/3D/Touch/Thermal QA, and achieve better/equivalent performance against strong multimodal LLMs, including OneLLM, BLIP-2, and SeViLA while reducing over 90% trainable parameters. We provide extensive analyses of CREMA, including the impact of each modality on reasoning domains, the design of the fusion module, and example visualizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; first two authors contributed equally.

Existing KD-based methods for multimodal AD that use fused multimodal features to obtain teacher representations face challenges. Anomalies in one modality may not be effectively captured in the fused teacher features, leading to detection failures. Besides, these methods do not fully leverage the rich intra- and inter-modality information. In this paper, we propose Crossmodal Reverse Distillation (CRD) based on Multi-branch design to realize Multimodal Industrial AD. By assigning independent branches to each modality, our method enables finer detection of anomalies within each modality. Furthermore, we enhance the interaction between modalities during the distillation process by designing Crossmodal Filter and Amplifier. With the idea of crossmodal mapping, the student network is allowed to better learn normal features while anomalies in all modalities are ensured to be effectively detected. Experimental verifications on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal anomaly detection and localization.</p></details> |  |

However, there are scenarios where retrieving visual information is either more beneficial or easier to access than textual data. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation benchmark, MRAG-Bench, in which we systematically identify and categorize scenarios where visually augmented knowledge is better than textual knowledge, for instance, more images from varying viewpoints. MRAG-Bench consists of 16,130 images and 1,353 human-annotated multiple-choice questions across 9 distinct scenarios. With MRAG-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of 10 open-source and 4 proprietary large vision-language models (LVLMs). Our results show that all LVLMs exhibit greater improvements when augmented with images compared to textual knowledge, confirming that MRAG-Bench is vision-centric. Additionally, we conduct extensive analysis with MRAG-Bench, which offers valuable insights into retrieval-augmented LVLMs. Notably, the top-performing model, GPT-4o, faces challenges in effectively leveraging retrieved knowledge, achieving only a 5.82% improvement with ground-truth information, in contrast to a 33.16% improvement observed in human participants. These findings highlight the importance of MRAG-Bench in encouraging the community to enhance LVLMs' ability to utilize retrieved visual knowledge more effectively.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, they still frequently produce hallucinated content, revealing AI-generated inconsistencies. We introduce ViBe (https://vibe-t2v-bench.github.io/): a large-scale dataset of hallucinated videos from open-source T2V models. We identify five major hallucination types: Vanishing Subject, Omission Error, Numeric Variability, Subject Dysmorphia, and Visual Incongruity. Using ten T2V models, we generated and manually annotated 3,782 videos from 837 diverse MS COCO captions. Our proposed benchmark includes a dataset of hallucinated videos and a classification framework using video embeddings. ViBe serves as a critical resource for evaluating T2V reliability and advancing hallucination detection. We establish classification as a baseline, with the TimeSFormer + CNN ensemble achieving the best performance (0.345 accuracy, 0.342 F1 score). While initial baselines proposed achieve modest accuracy, this highlights the difficulty of automated hallucination detection and the need for improved methods. Our research aims to drive the development of more robust T2V models and evaluate their outputs based on user preferences.</p></details> |  |

| **[Real-world validation of a multimodal LLM-powered pipeline for High-Accuracy Clinical Trial Patient Matching leveraging EHR data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15374v1)** | 2025-03-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.15374v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Patient recruitment in clinical trials is hindered by complex eligibility criteria and labor-intensive chart reviews. Prior research using text-only models have struggled to address this problem in a reliable and scalable way due to (1) limited reasoning capabilities, (2) information loss from converting visual records to text, and (3) lack of a generic EHR integration to extract patient data. Methods: We introduce a broadly applicable, integration-free, LLM-powered pipeline that automates patient-trial matching using unprocessed documents extracted from EHRs. Our approach leverages (1) the new reasoning-LLM paradigm, enabling the assessment of even the most complex criteria, (2) visual capabilities of latest LLMs to interpret medical records without lossy image-to-text conversions, and (3) multimodal embeddings for efficient medical record search. The pipeline was validated on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection dataset (288 diabetic patients) and a real-world dataset composed of 485 patients from 30 different sites matched against 36 diverse trials. Results: On the n2c2 dataset, our method achieved a new state-of-the-art criterion-level accuracy of 93\%. In real-world trials, the pipeline yielded an accuracy of 87\%, undermined by the difficulty to replicate human decision-making when medical records lack sufficient information. Nevertheless, users were able to review overall eligibility in under 9 minutes per patient on average, representing an 80\% improvement over traditional manual chart reviews. Conclusion: This pipeline demonstrates robust performance in clinical trial patient matching without requiring custom integration with site systems or trial-specific tailoring, thereby enabling scalable deployment across sites seeking to leverage AI for patient matching.</p></details> |  |

We formulate this as an inverse problem and show that under certain conditions perfect alignment can be achieved. We then address a specific application of alignment referred to as cross-modal transfer. Unsupervised cross-modal transfer aims to leverage a model trained with one modality to perform inference on another modality, without any labeled fine-tuning on the new modality. Assuming that semantic classes are represented as a mixture of Gaussians in the latent space, we show how cross-modal transfer can be performed by projecting the data points from the representation space onto different subspaces representing each modality. Our experiments on synthetic multimodal Gaussian data verify the effectiveness of our perfect alignment and cross-modal transfer method. We hope these findings inspire further exploration of the applications of perfect alignment and the use of Gaussian models for cross-modal learning.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and robust registration methods are essential for aligning data from different modalities, forming the foundation for multimodal sensor data fusion and enhancing perception systems' accuracy and reliability. The registration task between 2D images captured by cameras and 3D point clouds captured by Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors is usually treated as a visual pose estimation problem. High-dimensional feature similarities from different modalities are leveraged to identify pixel-point correspondences, followed by pose estimation techniques using least squares methods. However, existing approaches often resort to downsampling the original point cloud and image data due to computational constraints, inevitably leading to a loss in precision. Additionally, high-dimensional features extracted using different feature extractors from various modalities require specific techniques to mitigate cross-modal differences for effective matching. To address these challenges, we propose a method that uses edge information from the original point clouds and images for cross-modal registration. We retain crucial information from the original data by extracting edge points and pixels, enhancing registration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The use of edge points and edge pixels allows us to introduce an attention-based feature exchange block to eliminate cross-modal disparities. Furthermore, we incorporate an optimal matching layer to improve correspondence identification. We validate the accuracy of our method on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

While recent work has explored unlearning in Euclidean contrastive vision-language models, the effectiveness of concept removal in hyperbolic spaces remains unexplored. This paper investigates machine unlearning in hyperbolic contrastive learning by adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU, a model that embeds images and text in hyperbolic space to better capture semantic hierarchies. Through systematic experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that hyperbolic geometry offers distinct advantages for concept removal, achieving near perfect forgetting with reasonable performance on retained concepts, particularly when scaling to multiple concept removal. Our approach introduces hyperbolic-specific components including entailment calibration and norm regularization that leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space. Comparative analysis with Euclidean models reveals fundamental differences in unlearning dynamics, with hyperbolic unlearning reorganizing the semantic hierarchy while Euclidean approaches merely disconnect cross-modal associations. These findings not only advance machine unlearning techniques but also provide insights into the geometric properties that influence concept representation and removal in multimodal models.

Chronic wounds are difficult and costly to treat, and have become a serious burden on health care systems worldwide. Chronic wounds can have devastating consequences for the patient, with infection often leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality risk. Innovative deep learning methods for the detection and monitoring of such wounds have the potential to reduce the impact to both patient and clinician. We present a novel multimodal segmentation method which allows for the introduction of patient metadata into the training workflow whereby the patient data are expressed as Gaussian random fields. Our results indicate that the proposed method improved performance when utilising multiple models, each trained on different metadata categories. Using the Diabetic Foot Ulcer Challenge 2022 test set, when compared to the baseline results (intersection over union = 0.4670, Dice similarity coefficient = 0.5908) we demonstrate improvements of +0.0220 and +0.0229 for intersection over union and Dice similarity coefficient respectively. This paper presents the first study to focus on integrating patient data into a chronic wound segmentation workflow.

In this paper, we introduce JMMMU (Japanese MMMU), the first large-scale Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on expert-level tasks based on the Japanese cultural context. To facilitate comprehensive culture-aware evaluation, JMMMU features two complementary subsets: (i) culture-agnostic (CA) subset, where the culture-independent subjects (e.g., Math) are selected and translated into Japanese, enabling one-to-one comparison with its English counterpart MMMU; and (ii) culture-specific (CS) subset, comprising newly crafted subjects that reflect Japanese cultural context. Using the CA subset, we observe performance drop in many LMMs when evaluated in Japanese, which is purely attributable to language variation. Using the CS subset, we reveal their inadequate Japanese cultural understanding. Further, by combining both subsets, we identify that some LMMs perform well on the CA subset but not on the CS subset, exposing a shallow understanding of the Japanese language that lacks depth in cultural understanding. We hope this work will not only help advance LMM performance in Japanese but also serve as a guideline to create high-standard, culturally diverse benchmarks for multilingual LMM development.

By leveraging contrastive learning across diverse modalities, large-scale multimodal data enhances representational quality. However, a critical yet often overlooked challenge remains: multimodal data is rarely collected in a single process, and training from scratch is computationally expensive. Instead, emergent multimodal data can be used to optimize existing models gradually, \textit{i.e.}, models are trained on a sequence of modality pair data. We define this problem as Continual Multimodal Contrastive Learning (CMCL), an underexplored yet crucial research direction at the intersection of multimodal and continual learning. In this paper, we formulate CMCL through two specialized principles of stability and plasticity. We theoretically derive a novel optimization-based method, which projects updated gradients from dual sides onto subspaces where any gradient is prevented from interfering with the previously learned knowledge. Two upper bounds provide theoretical insights on both stability and plasticity in our solution. Beyond our theoretical contributions, we conduct experiments on multiple datasets by comparing our method against advanced continual learning baselines. The empirical results further support our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

In this paper, we introduce a multimodal generation framework that incorporates four major data modalities, including a novel addition of map modality. With tokenized modalities, our scene sequence generation framework autoregressively predicts each scene while managing computational demands through a two-stage approach. The Temporal AutoRegressive (TAR) component captures inter-frame dynamics for each modality while the Ordered AutoRegressive (OAR) component aligns modalities within each scene by sequentially predicting tokens in a fixed order. To maintain coherence between map and ego-action modalities, we introduce the Action-aware Map Alignment (AMA) module, which applies a transformation based on the ego-action to maintain coherence between these modalities. Our framework effectively generates complex, realistic driving scenes over extended sequences, ensuring multimodal consistency and offering fine-grained control over scene elements.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluation methods face limitations due to the significant human workload required to design Q&A pairs for visual images, which inherently restricts the scale and scope of evaluations. Although automated MLLM-as-judge approaches attempt to reduce the human workload through automatic evaluations, they often introduce biases. To address these problems, we propose an Unsupervised Peer review MLLM Evaluation framework. It utilizes only image data, allowing models to automatically generate questions and conduct peer review assessments of answers from other models, effectively alleviating the reliance on human workload. Additionally, we introduce the vision-language scoring system to mitigate the bias issues, which focuses on three aspects: (i) response correctness; (ii) visual understanding and reasoning; and (iii) image-text correlation. Experimental results demonstrate that UPME achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.944 with human evaluations on the MMstar dataset and 0.814 on the ScienceQA dataset, indicating that our framework closely aligns with human-designed benchmarks and inherent human preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

VisNumBench consists of about 1,900 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from both synthetic and real-world visual data, covering seven visual numerical attributes and four types of visual numerical estimation tasks. Our experiments on VisNumBench led to the following key findings: (i) The 17 MLLMs we tested, including open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL2.5, as well as proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, perform significantly below human levels in number sense-related tasks.

This study introduces an innovative deep learning-based model leveraging multimodal data-2D RGB images from different views, depth images, and 3D point clouds-for the non-invasive estimation of duck body dimensions and weight. A dataset of 1,023 Linwu ducks, comprising over 5,000 samples with diverse postures and conditions, was collected to support model training. The proposed method innovatively employs PointNet++ to extract key feature points from point clouds, extracts and computes corresponding 3D geometric features, and fuses them with multi-view convolutional 2D features. A Transformer encoder is then utilized to capture long-range dependencies and refine feature interactions, thereby enhancing prediction robustness. The model achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.33% and an R2 of 0.953 across eight morphometric parameters, demonstrating strong predictive capability. Unlike conventional manual measurements, the proposed model enables high-precision estimation while eliminating the necessity for physical handling, thereby reducing animal stress and broadening its application scope. This study marks the first application of deep learning techniques to poultry body dimension and weight estimation, providing a valuable reference for the intelligent and precise management of the livestock industry with far-reaching practical significance.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we present FakeClue, a comprehensive dataset containing over 100,000 images across seven categories, annotated with fine-grained artifact clues in natural language. FakeVLM demonstrates performance comparable to expert models while eliminating the need for additional classifiers, making it a robust solution for synthetic data detection. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets confirm the superiority of FakeVLM in both authenticity classification and artifact explanation tasks, setting a new benchmark for synthetic image detection.

However, several studies have revealed vulnerabilities in these models, such as generating unsafe content by text-to-image models. Existing benchmarks on multimodal models either predominantly assess the helpfulness of these models, or only focus on limited perspectives such as fairness and privacy. In this paper, we present the first unified platform, MMDT (Multimodal DecodingTrust), designed to provide a comprehensive safety and trustworthiness evaluation for MMFMs. Our platform assesses models from multiple perspectives, including safety, hallucination, fairness/bias, privacy, adversarial robustness, and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We have designed various evaluation scenarios and red teaming algorithms under different tasks for each perspective to generate challenging data, forming a high-quality benchmark. We evaluate a range of multimodal models using MMDT, and our findings reveal a series of vulnerabilities and areas for improvement across these perspectives.

Controlling the dispersion of multimodal probability distributions in biomolecular systems is critical for regulating stochastic behavior, robustness, and adaptability. However, modifying system parameters to adjust dispersion often affects peak positions, potentially altering a desired phenotype or even fundamental behavior in a genetic pathway. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that enables independent control of dispersion while preserving peak positions and modality using the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation (CFPE) and sharpness, a measure of probability concentration around individual peaks. By analyzing the steady-state solution of the CFPE, we derive explicit conditions under which peak sharpness can be tuned monotonically without changing peak positions or modality. We validate our approach through Monte Carlo simulations on a bimodal chemical system, demonstrating effective dispersion control while maintaining structural stability. This framework provides a systematic approach for designing biomolecular systems with tunable stochastic properties, contributing to advancements in synthetic biology and probabilistic cellular regulation.</p></details> |  |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have demonstrated impressive potential in tackling complex tasks involving visual, auditory, and textual data. However, critical issues related to truthfulness, safety, o1-like reasoning, and alignment with human preference remain insufficiently addressed. This gap has spurred the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application scenarios and optimization goals. Recent studies have shown that alignment algorithms are a powerful approach to resolving the aforementioned challenges.

Existing methods often rely on limited image priors, leading to suboptimal results. We propose a novel approach that leverages the rich contextual information available in multiple modalities -- including depth, segmentation, edges, and text prompts -- to learn a powerful generative prior for SISR within a diffusion model framework. We introduce a flexible network architecture that effectively fuses multimodal information, accommodating an arbitrary number of input modalities without requiring significant modifications to the diffusion process. Crucially, we mitigate hallucinations, often introduced by text prompts, by using spatial information from other modalities to guide regional text-based conditioning. Each modality's guidance strength can also be controlled independently, allowing steering outputs toward different directions, such as increasing bokeh through depth or adjusting object prominence via segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art generative SISR methods, achieving superior visual quality and fidelity.

LMMs specifically designed for this domain have demonstrated effective perception, planning, and prediction skills. However, many of these methods underutilize 3D spatial and temporal elements, relying mainly on image data. As a result, their effectiveness in dynamic driving environments is limited. We propose to integrate tracking information as an additional input to recover 3D spatial and temporal details that are not effectively captured in the images. We introduce a novel approach for embedding this tracking information into LMMs to enhance their spatiotemporal understanding of driving scenarios. By incorporating 3D tracking data through a track encoder, we enrich visual queries with crucial spatial and temporal cues while avoiding the computational overhead associated with processing lengthy video sequences or extensive 3D inputs. Moreover, we employ a self-supervised approach to pretrain the tracking encoder to provide LMMs with additional contextual information, significantly improving their performance in perception, planning, and prediction tasks for autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a gain of 9.5% in accuracy, an increase of 7.04 points in the ChatGPT score, and 9.4% increase in the overall score over baseline models on DriveLM-nuScenes benchmark, along with a 3.7% final score improvement on DriveLM-CARLA.

If undiagnosed, they cause neurological deficits, including cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction, and sensory loss. As tumors grow, intracranial pressure increases, potentially leading to fatal complications such as brain herniation. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to controlling these effects and slowing tumor progression. Deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly used to assist doctors in early diagnosis through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Our research proposes targeted neural architectures within multi-objective frameworks that can localize, segment, and classify the grade of these gliomas from multimodal MRI images to solve this critical issue. Our localization framework utilizes a targeted architecture that enhances the LinkNet framework with an encoder inspired by VGG19 for better multimodal feature extraction from the tumor along with spatial and graph attention mechanisms that sharpen feature focus and inter-feature relationships. For the segmentation objective, we deployed a specialized framework using the SeResNet101 CNN model as the encoder backbone integrated into the LinkNet architecture, achieving an IoU Score of 96%. The classification objective is addressed through a distinct framework implemented by combining the SeResNet152 feature extractor with Adaptive Boosting classifier, reaching an accuracy of 98.53%.

However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. Our experiments show that MAT can effectively be applied to different VL models and tasks to improve adversarial robustness, outperforming previous efforts. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.</p></details> | Under review |

MV-MATH includes multiple-choice, free-form, and multi-step questions, covering 11 subject areas across 3 difficulty levels, and serves as a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark for assessing MLLMs' mathematical reasoning in multi-visual contexts. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in multi-visual math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on MV-MATH.

Given the extensive applications of MLLMs, the associated safety issues have become increasingly critical. Due to the effectiveness of preference optimization in aligning MLLMs with human preferences, there is an urgent need for safety-related preference data for MLLMs. To address this, we construct the MMSafe-PO preference dataset towards harmless multimodal assistants, featuring multimodal instructions, the conversational format, and ranked paired responses from human feedback. We also identify two insightful observations: modality co-defense and modality cheating, which illustrate that MLLMs possess a certain level of inherent defense while still presenting unique safety challenges. Based on these observations, we propose the Blind Preference Optimization (BPO) approach. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks show that BPO effectively enhances the safety capabilities of MLLMs. Notably, BPO significantly improves the safety rate of the base MLLM by 45.0%, outperforming the DPO approach. Additionally, applying BPO to the MMSafe-PO dataset greatly reduces the base MLLM's unsafe rate on other safety benchmarks (14.5% on MM-SafetyBench and 82.9% on HarmEval, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of both the dataset and the approach.

However, multimodal reasoning, which requires integrating visual and textual information, remains a significant challenge. Existing visual-language models often struggle to effectively analyze and reason visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks hinders the accurate assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning.

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

As a highly efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes, training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models. However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow. TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug design by generating molecules with desired properties.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing studies always hold the assumption that full modalities are available. As a matter of fact, the cost for collecting genomic data is high, which sometimes makes genomic data unavailable in testing samples. A common way of tackling such incompleteness is to generate the genomic representations from the pathology images. Nevertheless, such strategy still faces the following two challenges: (1) The gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) are huge and thus hard for representation. (2) It is difficult to generate the genomic embeddings with diverse function categories in a unified generative framework. To address the above challenges, we propose a Conditional Latent Differentiation Variational AutoEncoder (LD-CVAE) for robust multimodal survival prediction, even with missing genomic data. Specifically, a Variational Information Bottleneck Transformer (VIB-Trans) module is proposed to learn compressed pathological representations from the gigapixel WSIs. To generate different functional genomic features, we develop a novel Latent Differentiation Variational AutoEncoder (LD-VAE) to learn the common and specific posteriors for the genomic embeddings with diverse functions. Finally, we use the product-of-experts technique to integrate the genomic common posterior and image posterior for the joint latent distribution estimation in LD-CVAE. We test the effectiveness of our method on five different cancer datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its superiority in both complete and missing modality scenarios.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted perturbations bypass security guardrails and elicit harmful outputs. In this paper, we present the first adversarial training (AT) paradigm tailored to defend against jailbreak attacks during the MLLM training phase. Extending traditional AT to this domain poses two critical challenges: efficiently tuning massive parameters and ensuring robustness against attacks across multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we introduce Projection Layer Against Adversarial Training (ProEAT), an end-to-end AT framework. ProEAT incorporates a projector-based adversarial training architecture that efficiently handles large-scale parameters while maintaining computational feasibility by focusing adversarial training on a lightweight projector layer instead of the entire model; additionally, we design a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism that optimizes the loss function's weight allocation based on task demands, streamlining the tuning process. To enhance defense performance, we propose a joint optimization strategy across visual and textual modalities, ensuring robust resistance to jailbreak attacks originating from either modality. Extensive experiments conducted on five major jailbreak attack methods across three mainstream MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ProEAT achieves state-of-the-art defense performance, outperforming existing baselines by an average margin of +34% across text and image modalities, while incurring only a 1% reduction in clean accuracy. Furthermore, evaluations on real-world embodied intelligent systems highlight the practical applicability of our framework, paving the way for the development of more secure and reliable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face key limitations: 1) They rely on multimodal mapping and metrics in Euclidean space, which cannot fully capture the hierarchical structures in histopathology (among patches from different resolutions) and genomics data (from genes to pathways). 2) They discretize survival time into independent risk intervals, which ignores its continuous and ordinal nature and fails to achieve effective optimization. 3) They treat censorship as a binary indicator, excluding censored samples from model optimization and not making full use of them. To address these challenges, we propose HySurvPred, a novel framework for survival prediction that integrates three key modules: Multimodal Hyperbolic Mapping (MHM), Angle-aware Ranking-based Contrastive Loss (ARCL) and Censor-Conditioned Uncertainty Constraint (CUC). Instead of relying on Euclidean space, we design the MHM module to explore the inherent hierarchical structures within each modality in hyperbolic space. To better integrate multimodal features in hyperbolic space, we introduce the ARCL module, which uses ranking-based contrastive learning to preserve the ordinal nature of survival time, along with the CUC module to fully explore the censored data.

To explore the potential of the world model in the remote sensing (RS) field, this paper proposes a label-efficient remote sensing world model for multimodal data fusion (FusDreamer). The FusDreamer uses the world model as a unified representation container to abstract common and high-level knowledge, promoting interactions across different types of data, \emph{i.e.}, hyperspectral (HSI), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and text data. Initially, a new latent diffusion fusion and multimodal generation paradigm (LaMG) is utilized for its exceptional information integration and detail retention capabilities. Subsequently, an open-world knowledge-guided consistency projection (OK-CP) module incorporates prompt representations for visually described objects and aligns language-visual features through contrastive learning. In this way, the domain gap can be bridged by fine-tuning the pre-trained world models with limited samples. Finally, an end-to-end multitask combinatorial optimization (MuCO) strategy can capture slight feature bias and constrain the diffusion process in a collaboratively learnable direction. Experiments conducted on four typical datasets indicate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed FusDreamer. The corresponding code will be released at https://github.com/Cimy-wang/FusDreamer.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent efforts on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs. Our project webpage with code release is at https://zhuoyan-xu.github.io/ada-llava/.</p></details> |  |

However, as these models become more prevalent, the need for explainability grows-understanding how these systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models. Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the model's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music understanding systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub repository: https://github.com/IamTheo2000/MusicLIME.

In existing methods, the information usually only flows from style to content, which may cause conflict between the style and content, harming the integration. Differently, in this work we build a bidirectional control flow between the style and the content, also adjusting the style towards the content, in which case the style-content collision is alleviated and the dynamics of the style is better preserved in the integration. Moreover, we extend the stylized motion generation from one modality, i.e. the style motion, to multiple modalities including texts and images through contrastive learning, leading to flexible style control on the motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across different datasets, while also enabling multimodal signals control. The code of our method will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we introduce MultiFoley, a model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports multimodal conditioning through text, audio, and video. Given a silent video and a text prompt, MultiFoley allows users to create clean sounds (e.g., skateboard wheels spinning without wind noise) or more whimsical sounds (e.g., making a lion's roar sound like a cat's meow). MultiFoley also allows users to choose reference audio from sound effects (SFX) libraries or partial videos for conditioning. A key novelty of our model lies in its joint training on both internet video datasets with low-quality audio and professional SFX recordings, enabling high-quality, full-bandwidth (48kHz) audio generation. Through automated evaluations and human studies, we demonstrate that MultiFoley successfully generates synchronized high-quality sounds across varied conditional inputs and outperforms existing methods.

Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research.

Code generation tasks that require long-structured outputs can also be enhanced by multimodality. Despite this, their use in commercial applications is often limited due to limited access to training data and restrictive licensing, which hinders open access. To address these limitations, we introduce BigDocs-7.5M, a high-quality, open-access dataset comprising 7.5 million multimodal documents across 30 tasks. We use an efficient data curation process to ensure our data is high-quality and license-permissive. Our process emphasizes accountability, responsibility, and transparency through filtering rules, traceable metadata, and careful content analysis. Additionally, we introduce BigDocs-Bench, a benchmark suite with 10 novel tasks where we create datasets that reflect real-world use cases involving reasoning over Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and code generation from images. Our experiments show that training with BigDocs-Bench improves average performance up to 25.8% over closed-source GPT-4o in document reasoning and structured output tasks such as Screenshot2HTML or Image2Latex generation. Finally, human evaluations showed a preference for outputs from models trained on BigDocs over GPT-4o. This suggests that BigDocs can help both academics and the open-source community utilize and improve AI tools to enhance multimodal capabilities and document reasoning.

By disentangling modality-specific information from information that is shared across modalities, we can improve interpretability and robustness and enable downstream tasks such as the generation of counterfactual outcomes. Separating the two types of information is challenging since they are often deeply entangled in many real-world applications. We propose Disentangled Self-Supervised Learning (DisentangledSSL), a novel self-supervised approach for learning disentangled representations. We present a comprehensive analysis of the optimality of each disentangled representation, particularly focusing on the scenario not covered in prior work where the so-called Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) point is not attainable. We demonstrate that DisentangledSSL successfully learns shared and modality-specific features on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets and consistently outperforms baselines on various downstream tasks, including prediction tasks for vision-language data, as well as molecule-phenotype retrieval tasks for biological data.

However, actual cases of biologically validated drug relocation remain very limited, and existing models have not yet fully utilized the structural information of the drug. Furthermore, most repositioning models are only used to complete the relationship matrix, and their practicality is poor when dealing with drug cold start problems. This paper proposes a structure-enhanced multimodal relationship prediction model (SMRP). SMPR is based on the SMILE structure of the drug, using the Mol2VEC method to generate drug embedded representations, and learn disease embedded representations through heterogeneous network graph neural networks. Ultimately, a drug-disease relationship matrix is constructed. In addition, to reduce the difficulty of users' use, SMPR also provides a cold start interface based on structural similarity based on reposition results to simply and quickly predict drug-related diseases. The repositioning ability and cold start capability of the model are verified from multiple perspectives. While the AUC and ACUPR scores of repositioning reach 99% and 61% respectively, the AUC of cold start achieve 80%. In particular, the cold start Recall indicator can reach more than 70%, which means that SMPR is more sensitive to positive samples. Finally, case analysis is used to verify the practical value of the model and visual analysis directly demonstrates the improvement of the structure to the model. For quick use, we also provide local deployment of the model and package it into an executable program.</p></details> |  |

However, this inherent heterogeneity in MLLM model structure and data types makes makeshift extensions to existing LLM training frameworks unsuitable for efficient MLLM training. In this paper, we present Cornstarch, the first general-purpose distributed MLLM training framework. Cornstarch facilitates modular MLLM construction, enables composable parallelization of constituent models, and introduces MLLM-specific optimizations to pipeline and context parallelism for efficient distributed MLLM training. Our evaluation shows that Cornstarch outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by up to $1.57\times$ in terms of training throughput.

In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models. We will publish our SFT dataset and benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClearSight: Visual Signal Enhancement for Object Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13107v1)** | 2025-03-17 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.13107v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model's bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.</p></details> |  |

To align with the next-token-prediction paradigm, current LMM-driven segmentation methods either use object boundary points to represent masks or introduce special segmentation tokens, whose hidden states are decoded by a segmentation model requiring the original image as input. However, these approaches often suffer from inadequate mask representation and complex architectures, limiting the potential of LMMs. In this work, we propose the Hierarchical Mask Tokenizer (HiMTok), which represents segmentation masks with up to 32 tokens and eliminates the need for the original image during mask de-tokenization. HiMTok allows for compact and coarse-to-fine mask representations, aligning well with the LLM next-token-prediction paradigm and facilitating the direct acquisition of segmentation capabilities. We develop a 3-stage training recipe for progressive learning of segmentation and visual capabilities, featuring a hierarchical mask loss for effective coarse-to-fine learning. Additionally, we enable bidirectional information flow, allowing conversion between bounding boxes and mask tokens to fully leverage multi-task training potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various segmentation tasks,while also enhancing visual grounding and maintaining overall visual understanding.</p></details> | technical report |

While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models.

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |

However, it is infeasible to collect all possible instruction datasets simultaneously in real-world scenarios. Thus, enabling MLLM with continual instruction tuning is essential for maintaining their adaptability. However, existing methods often trade off memory efficiency for performance gains, significantly compromising overall efficiency. In this paper, we propose a task-specific expansion and task-general fusion framework based on the variations in Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity across different model layers when trained on diverse datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the information leakage present in the existing benchmark and propose a new and more challenging benchmark to rationally evaluate the performance of different methods. Comprehensive experiments showcase a significant performance improvement of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be public available.</p></details> | Preprint |

As most LMM inference requests originate from edge devices with limited computational capabilities, the predominant inference pipeline involves directly forwarding the input data to an edge server which handles all computations. However, this approach introduces high transmission latency due to limited uplink bandwidth of edge devices and significant computation latency caused by the prohibitive number of visual tokens, thus hindering delay-sensitive tasks and degrading user experience. To address this challenge, we propose a task-oriented feature compression (TOFC) method for multimodal understanding in a device-edge co-inference framework, where visual features are merged by clustering and encoded by a learnable and selective entropy model before feature projection. Specifically, we employ density peaks clustering based on K nearest neighbors to reduce the number of visual features, thereby minimizing both data transmission and computational complexity. Subsequently, a learnable entropy model with hyperprior is utilized to encode and decode merged features, further reducing transmission overhead. To enhance compression efficiency, multiple entropy models are adaptively selected based on the characteristics of the visual features, enabling a more accurate estimation of the probability distribution. Comprehensive experiments on seven visual question answering benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFC method. Results show that TOFC achieves up to 60% reduction in data transmission overhead and 50% reduction in system latency while maintaining identical task performance, compared with traditional image compression methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent heterogeneity between these modalities, including unbalanced convergence and modal misalignment, poses significant challenges. Meanwhile, the large size of the detection-oriented feature also constrains existing fusion strategies to capture long-range dependencies for the 3D detection tasks. In this work, we introduce a fast yet effective multimodal 3D object detector, incorporating our proposed Instance-level Contrastive Distillation (ICD) framework and Cross Linear Attention Fusion Module (CLFM). ICD aligns instance-level image features with LiDAR representations through object-aware contrastive distillation, ensuring fine-grained cross-modal consistency. Meanwhile, CLFM presents an efficient and scalable fusion strategy that enhances cross-modal global interactions within sizable multimodal BEV features. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes 3D object detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Notably, our 3D object detector outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while achieving superior efficiency.

However, existing computational models often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. Psychological research has shown a strong correlation between pose and personality traits, yet previous research has largely ignored pose data in computational models. To address this gap, we develop a novel multimodal dataset that incorporates full-body pose data. The dataset includes video recordings of 287 participants completing a virtual interview with 36 questions, along with self-reported Big Five personality scores as labels. To effectively utilize this multimodal data, we introduce the Psychology-Inspired Network (PINet), which consists of three key modules: Multimodal Feature Awareness (MFA), Multimodal Feature Interaction (MFI), and Psychology-Informed Modality Correlation Loss (PIMC Loss). The MFA module leverages the Vision Mamba Block to capture comprehensive visual features related to personality, while the MFI module efficiently fuses the multimodal features. The PIMC Loss, grounded in psychological theory, guides the model to emphasize different modalities for different personality dimensions. Experimental results show that the PINet outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline models. Furthermore, the three modules of PINet contribute almost equally to the model's overall performance. Incorporating pose data significantly enhances the model's performance, with the pose modality ranking mid-level in importance among the five modalities. These findings address the existing gap in personality-related datasets that lack full-body pose data and provide a new approach for improving the accuracy of personality prediction models, highlighting the importance of integrating psychological insights into AI frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, AAAI 2025 Oral</p></details> |

Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning.

This paper addresses a key aspect of this gap by conducting a systematic survey of data modality-driven Vision-based Multimodal Interfaces (VMIs). VMIs are essential for integrating multimodal data, enabling more precise interpretation of user intentions and complex interactions across physical and digital environments. Unlike previous task- or scenario-driven surveys, this study highlights the critical role of the visual modality in processing contextual information and facilitating multimodal interaction.

While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising opportunities for BLV assistance, their development has been hindered by limited datasets. This limitation stems from the fact that BLV-aware annotation requires specialized domain knowledge and intensive labor. To address this gap, we introduce GuideDog, a novel accessibility-aware guide dataset containing 22K image-description pairs (including 2K human-annotated pairs) that capture diverse real-world scenes from a pedestrian's viewpoint. Our approach shifts the annotation burden from generation to verification through a collaborative human-AI framework grounded in established accessibility standards, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality annotations. We also develop GuideDogQA, a subset of 818 samples featuring multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate fine-grained visual perception capabilities, specifically object recognition and relative depth perception. Our experimental results highlight the importance of accurate spatial understanding for effective BLV guidance. GuideDog and GuideDogQA will advance research in MLLM-based assistive technologies for BLV individuals while contributing to broader applications in understanding egocentric scenes for robotics and augmented reality. The code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study this problem from the perspective of visual-spatial reasoning, and propose a new learning task for MLLMs, termed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT). Different from recent visual CoT studies, which focus more on visual knowledge reasoning, GCoT is keen to helping MLLMs to recognize and ground the relevant visual cues step by step, thereby predicting the correct answer with grounding coordinates as the intuitive basis. To facilitate this task, we also carefully design and construct a dataset called multimodal grounded chain-of-thought (MM-GCoT) consisting of 24,022 GCoT examples for 5,033 images. Besides, a comprehensive consistency evaluation system is also introduced, including the metrics of answer accuracy, grounding accuracy and answer-grounding consistency. We further design and conduct a bunch of experiments on 12 advanced MLLMs, and reveal some notable findings: i. most MLLMs performs poorly on the consistency evaluation, indicating obvious visual hallucination; ii. visual hallucination is not directly related to the parameter size and general multimodal performance, i.e., a larger and stronger MLLM is not less affected by this issue. Lastly, we also demonstrate that the proposed dataset can help existing MLLMs to well cultivate their GCoT capability and reduce the inconsistent answering significantly. Moreover, their GCoT can be also generalized to exiting multimodal tasks, such as open-world QA and REC.</p></details> |  |

However, their limitations in fine-grained spatial reasoning pose challenges for system interpretability and user trust. We introduce Logic-RAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that improves LMMs' spatial understanding in driving scenarios. Logic-RAG constructs a dynamic knowledge base (KB) about object-object relationships in first-order logic (FOL) using a perception module, a query-to-logic embedder, and a logical inference engine. We evaluated Logic-RAG on visual-spatial queries using both synthetic and real-world driving videos. When using popular LMMs (GPT-4V, Claude 3.5) as proxies for an autonomous driving system, these models achieved only 55% accuracy on synthetic driving scenes and under 75% on real-world driving scenes. Augmenting them with Logic-RAG increased their accuracies to over 80% and 90%, respectively. An ablation study showed that even without logical inference, the fact-based context constructed by Logic-RAG alone improved accuracy by 15%. Logic-RAG is extensible: it allows seamless replacement of individual components with improved versions and enables domain experts to compose new knowledge in both FOL and natural language. In sum, Logic-RAG addresses critical spatial reasoning deficiencies in LMMs for autonomous driving applications.

These methods face sustainability challenges due to the diversity of pathologies and the labor-intensive nature of data collection. To address these limitations, we highlight the need for universal multimodal embeddings that can support multiple downstream tasks. Previous approaches involve fine-tuning CLIP-based models, which handle images and texts separately, limiting their ability to capture complex multimodal relationships. Additionally, these models are evaluated across diverse datasets without a unified benchmark. In this paper, we explore the possibility of applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate pathology universal embeddings to address these challenges. Our contributions can be summarized in the following aspects: 1) We propose MLLM4PUE, a novel framework that leverages MLLMs to generate embeddings for various pathology downstream tasks. 2) We further introduce the Pathology Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (PMEB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the quality of pathology multimodal embeddings, which comprises 16 original tasks drawn from 15 datasets. 3) Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MLLM4PUE, illustrating MLLM-based models can effectively support a wide range of downstream tasks and unify the research direction for foundation models in pathology.</p></details> |  |

Existing MCoT studies design various methodologies and innovative reasoning paradigms to address the unique challenges of image, video, speech, audio, 3D, and structured data across different modalities, achieving extensive success in applications such as robotics, healthcare, autonomous driving, and multimodal generation. However, MCoT still presents distinct challenges and opportunities that require further focus to ensure consistent thriving in this field, where, unfortunately, an up-to-date review of this domain is lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic survey of MCoT reasoning, elucidating the relevant foundational concepts and definitions.

MMU aims to explore and comprehend the meanings of memes from various perspectives by performing tasks such as metaphor recognition, sentiment analysis, intention detection, and offensiveness detection. Despite making progress, limitations persist due to the loss of fine-grained metaphorical visual clue and the neglect of multimodal text-image weak correlation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-granular multimodal clue fusion model (MGMCF) to advance MMU. Firstly, we design an object-level semantic mining module to extract object-level image feature clues, achieving fine-grained feature clue extraction and enhancing the model's ability to capture metaphorical details and semantics. Secondly, we propose a brand-new global-local cross-modal interaction model to address the weak correlation between text and images. This model facilitates effective interaction between global multimodal contextual clues and local unimodal feature clues, strengthening their representations through a bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism. Finally, we devise a dual-semantic guided training strategy to enhance the model's understanding and alignment of multimodal representations in the semantic space. Experiments conducted on the widely-used MET-MEME bilingual dataset demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, there is an 8.14% increase in precision for offensiveness detection task, and respective accuracy enhancements of 3.53%, 3.89%, and 3.52% for metaphor recognition, sentiment analysis, and intention detection tasks. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing MMU.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

However, this impressive progress relies on vast amounts of data collected from the internet, raising significant concerns about privacy and security. To address these issues, machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the removal of specific knowledge from an already trained model without requiring retraining from scratch. Although MU for MLLMs has gained attention, current evaluations of its efficacy remain incomplete, and the underlying problem is often poorly defined, which hinders the development of strategies for creating more secure and trustworthy systems. To bridge this gap, we introduce a benchmark, named PEBench, which includes a dataset of personal entities and corresponding general event scenes, designed to comprehensively assess the performance of MU for MLLMs. Through PEBench, we aim to provide a standardized and robust framework to advance research in secure and privacy-preserving multimodal models. We benchmarked 6 MU methods, revealing their strengths and limitations, and shedding light on key challenges and opportunities for MU in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can similarly comprehend the 4D world remains uncertain. This paper explores multimodal spatio-temporal reasoning from an egocentric perspective, aiming to equip MLLMs with human-like reasoning capabilities. To support this objective, we introduce Ego-ST Bench, a novel benchmark containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs across four categories, systematically evaluating spatial, temporal, and integrated spatio-temporal reasoning. Additionally, we propose the ST-R1 Video model, a video-based reasoning model that incorporates reverse thinking into its reinforcement learning process, significantly enhancing performance. We combine long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning, achieving notable improvements with limited high-quality data. Ego-ST Bench and ST-R1 provide valuable insights and resources for advancing video-based spatio-temporal reasoning research.</p></details> |  |

Recently, process-level reward models (PRMs) were proposed to provide step-wise rewards that facilitate reinforcement learning and data production during training and guide LLMs toward correct steps during inference, thereby improving reasoning accuracy. However, existing benchmarks of PRMs are text-based and focus on error detection, neglecting other scenarios like reasoning search. To address this gap, we introduce MPBench, a comprehensive, multi-task, multimodal benchmark designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of PRMs in diverse scenarios. MPBench employs three evaluation paradigms, each targeting a specific role of PRMs in the reasoning process: (1) Step Correctness, which assesses the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step; (2) Answer Aggregation, which aggregates multiple solutions and selects the best one; and (3) Reasoning Process Search, which guides the search for optimal reasoning steps during inference. Through these paradigms, MPBench makes comprehensive evaluations and provides insights into the development of multimodal PRMs.</p></details> |  |

However, current machine learning (ML) models designed to analyze these datasets often lack interpretability and identifiability guarantees, which are essential for biomedical research. Recent advances in causal representation learning have shown promise in identifying interpretable latent causal variables with formal theoretical guarantees. Unfortunately, most current work on multimodal distributions either relies on restrictive parametric assumptions or yields only coarse identification results, limiting their applicability to biomedical research that favors a detailed understanding of the mechanisms. In this work, we aim to develop flexible identification conditions for multimodal data and principled methods to facilitate the understanding of biomedical datasets. Theoretically, we consider a nonparametric latent distribution (c.f., parametric assumptions in previous work) that allows for causal relationships across potentially different modalities. We establish identifiability guarantees for each latent component, extending the subspace identification results from previous work. Our key theoretical contribution is the structural sparsity of causal connections between modalities, which, as we will discuss, is natural for a large collection of biomedical systems. Empirically, we present a practical framework to instantiate our theoretical insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on both numerical and synthetic datasets. Results on a real-world human phenotype dataset are consistent with established biomedical research, validating our theoretical and methodological framework.</p></details> |  |

While this approach reduces computational overhead and model complexity, it often requires large amounts of training data to effectively capture the visual knowledge typically encoded by vision models like CLIP. The absence of a vision encoder implies that the model is likely to rely on substantial data to learn the necessary visual-semantic alignments. In this work, we present BREEN, a data-efficient encoder-free multimodal architecture that mitigates this issue. BREEN leverages a learnable query and image experts to achieve comparable performance with significantly less training data. The learnable query, positioned between image and text tokens, is supervised by the output of a pretrained CLIP model to distill visual knowledge, bridging the gap between visual and textual modalities. Additionally, the image expert processes image tokens and learnable queries independently, improving efficiency and reducing interference with the LLM's textual capabilities. BREEN achieves comparable performance to prior encoder-free state-of-the-art models like Mono-InternVL, using only 13 million text-image pairs in training about one percent of the data required by existing methods. Our work highlights a promising direction for data-efficient encoder-free multimodal learning, offering an alternative to traditional encoder-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021). We discuss how our interdisciplinary system could revolutionize PTSD therapy and cognitive neuroscience by enabling 24/7 monitoring, context-aware intervention, and rich data collection outside traditional labs. The vision is a future where AI-enhanced devices continuously collaborate with the human brain, offering therapeutic support and deep insights into neural function, with the resulting real-world context rich neural data, in turn, accelerating the development of more biologically-grounded and human-centric AI.</p></details> |  |

Extracting data from plots in research papers, however, has been such a complex task that it has predominantly been confined to manual data extraction. We show that current multimodal large language models, with proper instructions and engineered workflows, are capable of accurately extracting data from plots. This capability is inherent to the pretrained models and can be achieved with a chain-of-thought sequence of zero-shot engineered prompts we call PlotExtract, without the need to fine-tune. We demonstrate PlotExtract here and assess its performance on synthetic and published plots. We consider only plots with two axes in this analysis. For plots identified as extractable, PlotExtract finds points with over 90% precision (and around 90% recall) and errors in x and y position of around 5% or lower. These results prove that multimodal LLMs are a viable path for high-throughput data extraction for plots and in many circumstances can replace the current manual methods of data extraction.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

This is due to their tendency to simplify the reasoning process and the degradation of self-evaluation ability during downstream task fine-tuning. To address this, we intuitively propose \textit{Self-Evaluation Augmented Training (SEAT)}, which uses more powerful EMLLMs to evaluate CoT reasoning data. The evaluation data is then used to train EMLLMs. However, due to the difficulties EMLLMs face with processing long token input-output sequences, and the degradation of self-evaluation ability as a basis for CoT reasoning, the SEAT method is not fully adapted. Therefore, we further propose \textit{Cascaded Self-Evaluation Augmented Training (Cas-SEAT)}, which converts long prompts into cascaded short prompts, each focusing on a specific task. Additionally, we mix CoT reasoning and self-evaluation data to preserve its CoT reasoning ability while enhancing the self-evaluation capability of EMLLMs. We also conduct \textit{Double-level Data Filtering (DDF)}, which includes source data filtering and labeled data filtering, using both manual selection and MLLMs for filtering. Cas-SEAT and DDF work together to improve the performance of EMLLMs. Experiments show that Cas-SEAT achieves an average improvement of 22.16% across multiple datasets, and DDF significantly reduces the resource consumption of training</p></details> |  |

Synthetic UML activity and sequence diagram datasets were created to train and test the model. We compared standard fine-tuning with LoRA techniques to optimize base models. The experiments measured code generation accuracy across different model sizes and training strategies. These results demonstrated that domain-adapted MM-LLMs perform for UML code generation automation, whereby, at the best model, it achieved BLEU and SSIM scores of 0.779 and 0.942 on sequence diagrams.

While earlier work has applied self-supervised learning (SSL) to unlabeled data, its task-agnostic nature often results in learning suboptimal features for downstream tasks. Semi-supervised learning (SemiSL), which combines labeled and unlabeled data, offers a promising solution. However, existing multimodal SemiSL methods typically focus on unimodal or modality-shared features, ignoring valuable task-relevant modality-specific information, leading to a Modality Information Gap. In this paper, we propose STiL, a novel SemiSL tabular-image framework that addresses this gap by comprehensively exploring task-relevant information. STiL features a new disentangled contrastive consistency module to learn cross-modal invariant representations of shared information while retaining modality-specific information via disentanglement. We also propose a novel consensus-guided pseudo-labeling strategy to generate reliable pseudo-labels based on classifier consensus, along with a new prototype-guided label smoothing technique to refine pseudo-label quality with prototype embeddings, thereby enhancing task-relevant information learning in unlabeled data.

To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension.

A plantar pressure insole equipped with a machine learning pipeline classifies users into motor recovery stages with up to 94% accuracy, enabling quantitative tracking of walking patterns. A head-mounted eye-tracking module supports cognitive assessments and hands-free control of household devices, while ambient sensors ensure sub-second response times for interaction. These data streams are fused locally via a hierarchical Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, protecting privacy and minimizing latency. An embedded large language model (LLM) agent, Auto-Care, continuously interprets multimodal data to provide real-time interventions-issuing personalized reminders, adjusting environmental conditions, and notifying caregivers. Implemented in a post-stroke context, this integrated smart home platform increases overall user satisfaction by an average of 115% (p<0.01) compared to traditional home environment.

Through controlled experiments, we compare CoT-structured and standard textual annotations across large reasoning models (LRMs) and large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation employs a dual-layer framework assessing both intermediate reasoning and final inference quality.

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |

Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods. We suggest that this tool can improve the value of such sources in photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Biomedical Optics Express journal</p></details> |
