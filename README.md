| **[Fine-Tuning a Time Series Foundation Model with Wasserstein Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15367v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) for Natural Language Processing (NLP), there has been a surge in research focused on developing foundational models for time series forecasting. One approach involves training LLM architectures on tokenized time series data using cross-entropy loss. Although this method has demonstrated promising results, cross-entropy loss is primarily designed for classification tasks and does not account for the distance between classes. To address this limitation, we propose using the Wasserstein loss for such architectures. To validate our approach, we fine-tuned a foundational time series model on $22$ zero-shot datasets, comparing the performance of cross-entropy loss with that of Wasserstein loss. Our results demonstrate that replacing cross-entropy loss with Wasserstein loss significantly improves point estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 mai...</summary><p>4 main pages; 2 figures</p></details> |

The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods. Our codes are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[ST-Tree with Interpretability for Multivariate Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11620v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series classification is of great importance in practical applications and is a challenging task. However, deep neural network models such as Transformers exhibit high accuracy in multivariate time series classification but lack interpretability and fail to provide insights into the decision-making process. On the other hand, traditional approaches based on decision tree classifiers offer clear decision processes but relatively lower accuracy. Swin Transformer (ST) addresses these issues by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture both fine-grained local patterns and global patterns. It can also model multi-scale feature representation learning, thereby providing a more comprehensive representation of time series features. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose ST-Tree with interpretability for multivariate time series classification. Specifically, the ST-Tree model combines ST as the backbone network with an additional neural tree model. This integration allows us to fully leverage the advantages of ST in learning time series context while providing interpretable decision processes through the neural tree. This enables researchers to gain clear insights into the model's decision-making process and extract meaningful interpretations. Through experimental evaluations on 10 UEA datasets, we demonstrate that the ST-Tree model improves accuracy in multivariate time series classification tasks and provides interpretability through visualizing the decision-making process across different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted on May 15, 2024, major revisions on Aug 31, 2024</p></details> |
| **[An Open-Source Tool for Mapping War Destruction at Scale in Ukraine using Sentinel-1 Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02506v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Access to detailed war impact assessments is crucial for humanitarian organizations to effectively assist populations most affected by armed conflicts. However, maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground is challenging, especially in conflicts that cover vast territories and extend over long periods. This study presents a scalable and transferable method for estimating war-induced damage to buildings. We first train a machine learning model to output pixel-wise probability of destruction from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite image time series, leveraging existing, manual damage assessments as ground truth and cloud-based geospatial analysis tools for large-scale inference. We further post-process these assessments using open building footprints to obtain a final damage estimate per building. We introduce an accessible, open-source tool that allows users to adjust the confidence interval based on their specific requirements and use cases. Our approach enables humanitarian organizations and other actors to rapidly screen large geographic regions for war impacts. We provide two publicly accessible dashboards: a Ukraine Damage Explorer to dynamically view our pre-computed estimates, and a Rapid Damage Mapping Tool to easily run our method and produce custom maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Loss Framework for Decomposition-based Time Series Forecasting Methods: Balancing Global and Component Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11340v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time series forecasting, predicting future values based on past data, is crucial for diverse industries. Many current time series methods decompose time series into multiple sub-series, applying different model architectures and training with an end-to-end overall loss for forecasting. However, this raises a question: does this overall loss prioritize the importance of critical sub-series within the decomposition for the better performance? To investigate this, we conduct a study on the impact of overall loss on existing time series methods with sequence decomposition. Our findings reveal that overall loss may introduce bias in model learning, hindering the learning of the prioritization of more significant sub-series and limiting the forecasting performance. To address this, we propose a hybrid loss framework combining the global and component losses. This framework introduces component losses for each sub-series alongside the original overall loss. It employs a dual min-max algorithm to dynamically adjust weights between the overall loss and component losses, and within component losses. This enables the model to achieve better performance of current time series methods by focusing on more critical sub-series while still maintaining a low overall loss. We integrate our loss framework into several time series methods and evaluate the performance on multiple datasets. Results show an average improvement of 0.5-2% over existing methods without any modifications to the model architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks with Incremental Blocks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11303v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) have shown promise in modelling nonlinear dynamic systems with order uncertainty due to their advantages of easy implementation, less human intervention, and strong approximation capability. This paper develops the original RSCNs with block increments, termed block RSCNs (BRSCNs), to further enhance the learning capacity and efficiency of the network. BRSCNs can simultaneously add multiple reservoir nodes (subreservoirs) during the construction. Each subreservoir is configured with a unique structure in the light of a supervisory mechanism, ensuring the universal approximation property. The reservoir feedback matrix is appropriately scaled to guarantee the echo state property of the network. Furthermore, the output weights are updated online using a projection algorithm, and the persistent excitation conditions that facilitate parameter convergence are also established. Numerical results over a time series prediction, a nonlinear system identification task, and two industrial data predictive analyses demonstrate that the proposed BRSCN performs favourably in terms of modelling efficiency, learning, and generalization performance, highlighting their significant potential for coping with complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Role of Textual Prompts in LLM for Time Series Forecasting: an Adapter View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14782v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the burgeoning domain of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in applying LLM to time series forecasting, with multiple studies focused on leveraging textual prompts to further enhance the predictive prowess. This study aims to understand how and why the integration of textual prompts into LLM can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of time series, which is not obvious at the glance, given the significant domain gap between texts and time series. Our extensive examination leads us to believe that (a) adding text prompts is roughly equivalent to introducing additional adapters, and (b) It is the introduction of learnable parameters rather than textual information that aligns the LLM with the time series forecasting task, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Inspired by this discovery, we developed four adapters that explicitly address the gap between LLM and time series, and further improve the prediction accuracy. Overall,our work highlights how textual prompts enhance LLM accuracy in time series forecasting and suggests new avenues for continually improving LLM-based time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DecoR: Deconfounding Time Series with Robust Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07005v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference on time series data is a challenging problem, especially in the presence of unobserved confounders. This work focuses on estimating the causal effect between two time series that are confounded by a third, unobserved time series. Assuming spectral sparsity of the confounder, we show how in the frequency domain this problem can be framed as an adversarial outlier problem. We introduce Deconfounding by Robust regression (DecoR), a novel approach that estimates the causal effect using robust linear regression in the frequency domain. Considering two different robust regression techniques, we first improve existing bounds on the estimation error for such techniques. Crucially, our results do not require distributional assumptions on the covariates. We can therefore use them in time series settings. Applying these results to DecoR, we prove, under suitable assumptions, upper bounds for the estimation error of DecoR that imply consistency. We demonstrate DecoR's effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world data from Earth system science. The simulation experiments furthermore suggest that DecoR is robust with respect to model misspecification.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SOFTS: Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Series-Core Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14197v3)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as finance, traffic management, energy, and healthcare. Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of channel independence to resist distribution drift but neglect channel correlations, limiting further enhancements. Several methods utilize mechanisms like attention or mixer to address this by capturing channel correlations, but they either introduce excessive complexity or rely too heavily on the correlation to achieve satisfactory results under distribution drifts, particularly with a large number of channels. Addressing this gap, this paper presents an efficient MLP-based model, the Series-cOre Fused Time Series forecaster (SOFTS), which incorporates a novel STar Aggregate-Redistribute (STAR) module. Unlike traditional approaches that manage channel interactions through distributed structures, \textit{e.g.}, attention, STAR employs a centralized strategy to improve efficiency and reduce reliance on the quality of each channel. It aggregates all series to form a global core representation, which is then dispatched and fused with individual series representations to facilitate channel interactions effectively.SOFTS achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods with only linear complexity. The broad applicability of the STAR module across different forecasting models is also demonstrated empirically. For further research and development, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/Secilia-Cxy/SOFTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[EXCON: Extreme Instance-based Contrastive Representation Learning of Severely Imbalanced Multivariate Time Series for Solar Flare Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11249v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In heliophysics research, predicting solar flares is crucial due to their potential to impact both space-based systems and Earth's infrastructure substantially. Magnetic field data from solar active regions, recorded by solar imaging observatories, are transformed into multivariate time series to enable solar flare prediction using temporal window-based analysis. In the realm of multivariate time series-driven solar flare prediction, addressing severe class imbalance with effective strategies for multivariate time series representation learning is key to developing robust predictive models. Traditional methods often struggle with overfitting to the majority class in prediction tasks where major solar flares are infrequent. This work presents EXCON, a contrastive representation learning framework designed to enhance classification performance amidst such imbalances. EXCON operates through four stages: obtaining core features from multivariate time series data; selecting distinctive contrastive representations for each class to maximize inter-class separation; training a temporal feature embedding module with a custom extreme reconstruction loss to minimize intra-class variation; and applying a classifier to the learned embeddings for robust classification. The proposed method leverages contrastive learning principles to map similar instances closer in the feature space while distancing dissimilar ones, a strategy not extensively explored in solar flare prediction tasks. This approach not only addresses class imbalance but also offers a versatile solution applicable to univariate and multivariate time series across binary and multiclass classification problems. Experimental results, including evaluations on the benchmark solar flare dataset and multiple time series archive datasets with binary and multiclass labels, demonstrate EXCON's efficacy in enhancing classification performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2024) on October 27, 2024, as a main conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Introducing Spectral Attention for Long-Range Dependency in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20772v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence modeling faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies across diverse tasks. Recent linear and transformer-based forecasters have shown superior performance in time series forecasting. However, they are constrained by their inherent inability to effectively address long-range dependencies in time series data, primarily due to using fixed-size inputs for prediction. Furthermore, they typically sacrifice essential temporal correlation among consecutive training samples by shuffling them into mini-batches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fast and effective Spectral Attention mechanism, which preserves temporal correlations among samples and facilitates the handling of long-range information while maintaining the base model structure. Spectral Attention preserves long-period trends through a low-pass filter and facilitates gradient to flow between samples. Spectral Attention can be seamlessly integrated into most sequence models, allowing models with fixed-sized look-back windows to capture long-range dependencies over thousands of steps. Through extensive experiments on 11 real-world time series datasets using 7 recent forecasting models, we consistently demonstrate the efficacy of our Spectral Attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Co-fi...</summary><p>Co-first Author: Bong Gyun Kang, Dongjun Lee.

| **[RPN 2: On Interdependence Function Learning Towards Unifying and Advancing CNN, RNN, GNN, and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11162v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper builds upon our previous work on the Reconciled Polynomial Network (RPN). The original RPN model was designed under the assumption of input data independence, presuming the independence among both individual instances within data batches and attributes in each data instance. However, this assumption often proves invalid for function learning tasks involving complex, interdependent data such as language, images, time series, and graphs. Ignoring such data interdependence may inevitably lead to significant performance degradation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the new Reconciled Polynomial Network (version 2), namely RPN 2, in this paper. By incorporating data and structural interdependence functions, RPN 2 explicitly models data interdependence via new component functions in its architecture. This enhancement not only significantly improves RPN 2's learning performance but also substantially expands its unifying potential, enabling it to encompass a broader range of contemporary dominant backbone models within its canonical representation. These backbones include, but are not limited to, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and Transformers. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental distinctions among these backbone models primarily stem from their diverse approaches to defining the interdependence functions. Furthermore, this unified representation opens up new opportunities for designing innovative architectures with the potential to surpass the performance of these dominant backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>105 p...</summary><p>105 pages, 37 figures, 6 tables, preprint version</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-enhanced Transformer for Multivariate Long Sequence Time-series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11046v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Long Sequence Time-series Forecasting (LSTF) has been a critical task across various real-world applications. Recent advancements focus on the application of transformer architectures attributable to their ability to capture temporal patterns effectively over extended periods. However, these approaches often overlook the inherent relationships and interactions between the input variables that could be drawn from their characteristic properties. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by integrating information-rich Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) with state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures. We introduce a novel approach that encapsulates conceptual relationships among variables within a well-defined knowledge graph, forming dynamic and learnable KGEs for seamless integration into the transformer architecture. We investigate the influence of this integration into seminal architectures such as PatchTST, Autoformer, Informer, and Vanilla Transformer. Furthermore, we thoroughly investigate the performance of these knowledge-enhanced architectures along with their original implementations for long forecasting horizons and demonstrate significant improvement in the benchmark results. This enhancement empowers transformer-based architectures to address the inherent structural relation between variables. Our knowledge-enhanced approach improves the accuracy of multivariate LSTF by capturing complex temporal and relational dynamics across multiple domains. To substantiate the validity of our model, we conduct comprehensive experiments using Weather and Electric Transformer Temperature (ETT) datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Steam Turbine Anomaly Detection: An Unsupervised Learning Approach Using Enhanced Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10765v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As core thermal power generation equipment, steam turbines incur significant expenses and adverse effects on operation when facing interruptions like downtime, maintenance, and damage. Accurate anomaly detection is the prerequisite for ensuring the safe and stable operation of steam turbines. However, challenges in steam turbine anomaly detection, including inherent anomalies, lack of temporal information analysis, and high-dimensional data complexity, limit the effectiveness of existing methods. To address these challenges, we proposed an Enhanced Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder using Deep Advanced Features and Gaussian Mixture Model (ELSTMVAE-DAF-GMM) for precise unsupervised anomaly detection in unlabeled datasets. Specifically, LSTMVAE, integrating LSTM with VAE, was used to project high-dimensional time-series data to a low-dimensional phase space. The Deep Autoencoder-Local Outlier Factor (DAE-LOF) sample selection mechanism was used to eliminate inherent anomalies during training, further improving the model's precision and reliability. The novel deep advanced features (DAF) hybridize latent embeddings and reconstruction discrepancies from the LSTMVAE model and provide a more comprehensive data representation within a continuous and structured phase space, significantly enhancing anomaly detection by synergizing temporal dynamics with data pattern variations. These DAF were incorporated into GMM to ensure robust and effective unsupervised anomaly detection. We utilized real operating data from industry steam turbines and conducted both comparison and ablation experiments, demonstrating superior anomaly detection outcomes characterized by high accuracy and minimal false alarm rates compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowScope: Enhancing Decision Making by Time Series Forecasting based on Prediction Optimization using HybridFlow Forecast Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10716v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is crucial in several sectors, such as meteorology, retail, healthcare, and finance. Accurately forecasting future trends and patterns is crucial for strategic planning and making well-informed decisions. In this case, it is crucial to include many forecasting methodologies. The strengths of Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for linear time series, Seasonal ARIMA models (SARIMA) for seasonal time series, Exponential Smoothing State Space Models (ETS) for handling errors and trends, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network model for complex pattern recognition have been combined to create a comprehensive framework called FlowScope. SARIMA excels in capturing seasonal variations, whereas ARIMA ensures effective handling of linear time series. ETS models excel in capturing trends and correcting errors, whereas LSTM networks excel in reflecting intricate temporal connections. By combining these methods from both machine learning and deep learning, we propose a deep-hybrid learning approach FlowScope which offers a versatile and robust platform for predicting time series data. This empowers enterprises to make informed decisions and optimize long-term strategies for maximum performance.

| **[Multiscale Dubuc: A New Similarity Measure for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10418v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying similarities between time series in a meaningful way remains a challenge in time series analysis, despite many advances in the field. Most real-world solutions still rely on a few popular measures, such as Euclidean Distance (EuD), Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS), and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The strengths and weaknesses of these measures have been studied extensively, and incremental improvements have been proposed. In this study, however, we present a different similarity measure that fuses the notion of Dubuc's variation from fractal analysis with the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) measure which is widely used in object recognition (also known as the Jaccard Index). In this proof-of-concept paper, we introduce the Multiscale Dubuc Distance (MDD) measure and prove that it is a metric, possessing desirable properties such as the triangle inequality. We use 95 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive to compare MDD's performance with EuD, LCSS, and DTW. Our experiments show that MDD's overall success, without any case-specific customization, is comparable to DTW with optimized window sizes per dataset. We also highlight several datasets where MDD's performance improves significantly when its single parameter is customized. This customization serves as a powerful tool for gauging MDD's sensitivity to noise. Lastly, we show that MDD's running time is linear in the length of the time series, which is crucial for real-world applications involving very large datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, IEEE Big Data 2024</p></details> |
| **[Swarm Characteristics Classification Using Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19572v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the characteristics of swarming autonomous agents is critical for defense and security applications. This article presents a study on using supervised neural network time series classification (NN TSC) to predict key attributes and tactics of swarming autonomous agents for military contexts. Specifically, NN TSC is applied to infer two binary attributes - communication and proportional navigation - which combine to define four mutually exclusive swarm tactics. We identify a gap in literature on using NNs for swarm classification and demonstrate the effectiveness of NN TSC in rapidly deducing intelligence about attacking swarms to inform counter-maneuvers. Through simulated swarm-vs-swarm engagements, we evaluate NN TSC performance in terms of observation window requirements, noise robustness, and scalability to swarm size. Key findings show NNs can predict swarm behaviors with 97% accuracy using short observation windows of 20 time steps, while also demonstrating graceful degradation down to 80% accuracy under 50% noise, as well as excellent scalability to swarm sizes from 10 to 100 agents. These capabilities are promising for real-time decision-making support in defense scenarios by rapidly inferring insights about swarm behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added funding acknowledgment and author bios</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Neural Goodness-of-Fit Test for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13986v3)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are crucial across diverse domains such as finance and healthcare, where accurate forecasting and decision-making rely on advanced modeling techniques. While generative models have shown great promise in capturing the intricate dynamics inherent in time series, evaluating their performance remains a major challenge. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short due to the temporal dependencies and potential high dimensionality of the features. In this paper, we propose the REcurrent NeurAL (RENAL) Goodness-of-Fit test, a novel and statistically rigorous framework for evaluating generative time series models. By leveraging recurrent neural networks, we transform the time series into conditionally independent data pairs, enabling the application of a chi-square-based goodness-of-fit test to the temporal dependencies within the data. This approach offers a robust, theoretically grounded solution for assessing the quality of generative models, particularly in settings with limited time sequences. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy. Our method fills a critical gap in the evaluation of time series generative models, offering a tool that is both practical and adaptable to high-stakes applications.</p></details> | 27 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Any2Any: Incomplete Multimodal Retrieval with Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10513v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents perceive and interpret their surroundings by integrating multimodal inputs, such as vision, audio, and LiDAR. These perceptual modalities support retrieval tasks, such as place recognition in robotics. However, current multimodal retrieval systems encounter difficulties when parts of the data are missing due to sensor failures or inaccessibility, such as silent videos or LiDAR scans lacking RGB information. We propose Any2Any-a novel retrieval framework that addresses scenarios where both query and reference instances have incomplete modalities. Unlike previous methods limited to the imputation of two modalities, Any2Any handles any number of modalities without training generative models. It calculates pairwise similarities with cross-modal encoders and employs a two-stage calibration process with conformal prediction to align the similarities. Any2Any enables effective retrieval across multimodal datasets, e.g., text-LiDAR and text-time series. It achieves a Recall@5 of 35% on the KITTI dataset, which is on par with baseline models with complete modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generation of synthetic gait data: application to multiple sclerosis patients' gait patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10377v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading cause of severe non-traumatic disability in young adults and its incidence is increasing worldwide. The variability of gait impairment in MS necessitates the development of a non-invasive, sensitive, and cost-effective tool for quantitative gait evaluation. The eGait movement sensor, designed to characterize human gait through unit quaternion time series (QTS) representing hip rotations, is a promising approach. However, the small sample sizes typical of clinical studies pose challenges for the stability of gait data analysis tools. To address these challenges, this article presents two key scientific contributions. First, a comprehensive framework is proposed for transforming QTS data into a form that preserves the essential geometric properties of gait while enabling the use of any tabular synthetic data generation method. Second, a synthetic data generation method is introduced, based on nearest neighbors weighting, which produces high-fidelity synthetic QTS data suitable for small datasets and private data environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method, is demonstrated through its application to MS gait data, showing very good fidelity and respect of the initial geometry of the data. Thanks to this work, we are able to produce synthetic data sets and work on the stability of clustering methods.</p></details> |  |

During the inference phase, end-users interact with ML services to gain insights, recommendations, or actions based on the input data. For this reason, serving strategies are nowadays crucial for deploying and managing models in production environments effectively. These strategies ensure that models are available, scalable, reliable, and performant for real-world applications, such as time series forecasting, image classification, natural language processing, and so on. In this paper, we evaluate the performances of five widely-used model serving frameworks (TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, MLServer, MLflow, and BentoML) under four different scenarios (malware detection, cryptocoin prices forecasting, image classification, and sentiment analysis). We demonstrate that TensorFlow Serving is able to outperform all the other frameworks in serving deep learning (DL) models. Moreover, we show that DL-specific frameworks (TensorFlow Serving and TorchServe) display significantly lower latencies than the three general-purpose ML frameworks (BentoML, MLFlow, and MLServer).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on State-of-the-art Deep Learning Applications and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17561v5)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, is a data-driven method that uses multiple layers of interconnected units (neurons) to learn intricate patterns and representations directly from raw input data. Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is challenging due to the algorithm's complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications. However, the studies mostly focused on the types of deep learning models and convolutional neural network architectures, offering limited coverage of the state-of-the-art deep learning models and their applications in solving complex problems across different domains. Therefore, motivated by the limitations, this study aims to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art deep learning models in computer vision, natural language processing, time series analysis and pervasive computing. We highlight the key features of the models and their effectiveness in solving the problems within each domain. Furthermore, this study presents the fundamentals of deep learning, various deep learning model types and prominent convolutional neural network architectures. Finally, challenges and future directions in deep learning research are discussed to offer a broader perspective for future researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess Site Closure Time Frames for Soil and Groundwater Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10214v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) is gaining prominence as an effective method for managing soil and groundwater contamination due to its cost-efficiency and minimal environmental disruption. Despite its benefits, MNA necessitates extensive groundwater monitoring to ensure that contaminant levels decrease to meet safety standards. This study expands the capabilities of PyLEnM, a Python package designed for long-term environmental monitoring, by incorporating new algorithms to enhance its predictive and analytical functionalities. We introduce methods to estimate the timeframe required for contaminants like Sr-90 and I-129 to reach regulatory safety standards using linear regression and to forecast future contaminant levels with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. Additionally, Random Forest regression is employed to identify factors influencing the time to reach safety standards. Our methods are illustrated using data from the Savannah River Site (SRS) F-Area, where preliminary findings reveal a notable downward trend in contaminant levels, with variability linked to initial concentrations and groundwater flow dynamics.

| **[Causal Time-Series Synchronization for Multi-Dimensional Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10152v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process industry's high expectations for Digital Twins require modeling approaches that can generalize across tasks and diverse domains with potentially different data dimensions and distributional shifts i.e., Foundational Models. Despite success in natural language processing and computer vision, transfer learning with (self-) supervised signals for pre-training general-purpose models is largely unexplored in the context of Digital Twins in the process industry due to challenges posed by multi-dimensional time-series data, lagged cause-effect dependencies, complex causal structures, and varying number of (exogenous) variables. We propose a novel channel-dependent pre-training strategy that leverages synchronized cause-effect pairs to overcome these challenges by breaking down the multi-dimensional time-series data into pairs of cause-effect variables. Our approach focuses on: (i) identifying highly lagged causal relationships using data-driven methods, (ii) synchronizing cause-effect pairs to generate training samples for channel-dependent pre-training, and (iii) evaluating the effectiveness of this approach in channel-dependent forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and generalization capability compared to traditional training methods.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[PFML: Self-Supervised Learning of Time-Series Data Without Representation Collapse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10087v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a data-driven learning approach that utilizes the innate structure of the data to guide the learning process. In contrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes the inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal. However, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where the model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue hinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as trying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers' time and effort. This paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called Prediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting masked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by predicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked embeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed to avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to different time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life classification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and movement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data, emotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG data. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar pre-existing SSL method and competitive against the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually simpler and without suffering from representation collapse.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models for time series data prediction, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are inefficient and generalize poorly as they cannot capture complex temporal relationships. In this paper, we present a probabilistic generative model that can be trained to capture temporal information, and that is robust to data errors. We call it Time Deep Latent Gaussian Model (tDLGM). Its novel architecture is inspired by Deep Latent Gaussian Model (DLGM). Our model is trained to minimize a loss function based on the negative log loss. One contributing factor to Time Deep Latent Gaussian Model (tDLGM) robustness is our regularizer, which accounts for data trends. Experiments conducted show that tDLGM is able to reconstruct and generate complex time series data, and that it is robust against to noise and faulty data.</p></details> | <details><summary>New r...</summary><p>New revision added a space between "for" and "Time-Series" in the title</p></details> |
| **[Is Precise Recovery Necessary? A Task-Oriented Imputation Approach for Time Series Forecasting on Variable Subset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09928v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variable Subset Forecasting (VSF) refers to a unique scenario in multivariate time series forecasting, where available variables in the inference phase are only a subset of the variables in the training phase. VSF presents significant challenges as the entire time series may be missing, and neither inter- nor intra-variable correlations persist. Such conditions impede the effectiveness of traditional imputation methods, primarily focusing on filling in individual missing data points. Inspired by the principle of feature engineering that not all variables contribute positively to forecasting, we propose Task-Oriented Imputation for VSF (TOI-VSF), a novel framework shifts the focus from accurate data recovery to directly support the downstream forecasting task. TOI-VSF incorporates a self-supervised imputation module, agnostic to the forecasting model, designed to fill in missing variables while preserving the vital characteristics and temporal patterns of time series data. Additionally, we implement a joint learning strategy for imputation and forecasting, ensuring that the imputation process is directly aligned with and beneficial to the forecasting objective. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate the superiority of TOI-VSF, outperforming baseline methods by $15\%$ on average.</p></details> |  |

While some work has been performed on the intersection of these two trends, those efforts were largely limited to using the vanilla transformer directly without adjusting its architecture for the setting of a physical system. In this work we develop a transformer-inspired neural network and use it to learn a dynamical system. We (for the first time) change the activation function of the attention layer to imbue the transformer with structure-preserving properties to improve long-term stability. This is shown to be of great advantage when applying the neural network to learning the trajectory of a rigid body.</p></details> | <details><summary>Will ...</summary><p>Will be published as part of "Cemracs Proceedings 2023" (status: accepted)</p></details> |

The success rate of the entire HO procedure is significantly affected by the preparation stage. As massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems with large antenna arrays allow resolving finer details of channel behavior, we investigate how machine learning can be applied to time series data of beam measurements in the Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) system to improve the HO procedure. This paper introduces the Early-Scheduled Handover Preparation scheme designed to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the HO procedure, particularly in scenarios involving high mobility and dense small cell deployments. Early-Scheduled Handover Preparation focuses on optimizing the timing of the HO preparation phase by leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the earliest possible trigger points for HO events. We identify a new early trigger for HO preparation and demonstrate how it can beneficially reduce the required time for HO execution reducing channel quality degradation. These insights enable a new HO preparation scheme that offers a novel, user-aware, and proactive HO decision making in MIMO scenarios incorporating mobility.</p></details> |  |

Over time, the field of machine learning fairness has evolved to address these issues. This paper provides an extensive overview of this field and introduces two formal frameworks to tackle open questions in machine learning fairness. In one framework, operator-valued optimisation and min-max objectives are employed to address unfairness in time-series problems. This approach showcases state-of-the-art performance on the notorious COMPAS benchmark dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. In the second framework, the challenge of lacking sensitive attributes, such as gender and race, in commonly used datasets is addressed. This issue is particularly pressing because existing algorithms in this field predominantly rely on the availability or estimations of such attributes to assess and mitigate unfairness. Here, a framework for a group-blind bias-repair is introduced, aiming to mitigate bias without relying on sensitive attributes. The efficacy of this approach is showcased through analyses conducted on the Adult Census Income dataset. Additionally, detailed algorithmic analyses for both frameworks are provided, accompanied by convergence guarantees, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the proposed methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.11407</p></details> |

This paper presents findings from a field study aimed at understanding the users information needs and search behaviors specific to MVR retrieval. By conducting and analyzing expert interviews, the study identifies application scenarios and highlights challenges in retrieving multimedia content from the metaverse. The results reveal existing application scenarios of MVRs and confirm the relevance of capturing time-series data from the graphical rendering process and related input-output devices, which are also highly relevant to user needs. Furthermore, the study provides a foundation for developing retrieval systems tailored to MVRs by defining use cases, user stereotypes, and specific requirements for MVR Retrieval systems. The findings contribute to a better understanding of information search behaviors in MVR Retrieval and pave the way for future research and system design in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 Figures, 8 Tables</p></details> |

Clinically, COPD is defined using the summary measures derived from a spirometry test but these are not always adequate. Here we show that using the high-dimensional raw spirogram can provide a richer signal compared to just using the summary measures. We design a transformer-based deep learning technique to process the raw spirogram values along with demographic information and predict clinically-relevant endpoints related to COPD. Our method is able to perform better than prior works while being more computationally efficient. Using the weights learned by the model, we make the framework more interpretable by identifying parts of the spirogram that are important for the model predictions. Pairing up with a board-certified pulmonologist, we also provide clinical insights into the different aspects of the spirogram and show that the explanations obtained from the model align with underlying medical knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a workshop paper to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Yet with the growing use of wide-field, multiplexed observational resources, individual sources of interest often have a broad range of observational modes available. Here we construct an astronomical multimodal dataset and propose AstroM$^3$, a self-supervised pre-training approach that enables a model to learn from multiple modalities simultaneously. Specifically, we extend the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model to a trimodal setting, allowing the integration of time-series photometry data, spectra, and astrophysical metadata. In a fine-tuning supervised setting, our results demonstrate that CLIP pre-training improves classification performance for time-series photometry, where accuracy increases from 84.6% to 91.5%. Furthermore, CLIP boosts classification accuracy by up to 12.6% when the availability of labeled data is limited, showing the effectiveness of leveraging larger corpora of unlabeled data. In addition to fine-tuned classification, we can use the trained model in other downstream tasks that are not explicitly contemplated during the construction of the self-supervised model. In particular we show the efficacy of using the learned embeddings for misclassifications identification, similarity search, and anomaly detection. One surprising highlight is the "rediscovery" of Mira subtypes and two Rotational variable subclasses using manifold learning and dimension reduction algorithm. To our knowledge this is the first construction of an $n>2$ mode model in astronomy. Extensions to $n>3$ modes is naturally anticipated with this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locally Private Sampling with Public Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08791v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local differential privacy (LDP) is increasingly employed in privacy-preserving machine learning to protect user data before sharing it with an untrusted aggregator. Most LDP methods assume that users possess only a single data record, which is a significant limitation since users often gather extensive datasets (e.g., images, text, time-series data) and frequently have access to public datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a locally private sampling framework that leverages both the private and public datasets of each user. Specifically, we assume each user has two distributions: $p$ and $q$ that represent their private dataset and the public dataset, respectively. The objective is to design a mechanism that generates a private sample approximating $p$ while simultaneously preserving $q$. We frame this objective as a minimax optimization problem using $f$-divergence as the utility measure. We fully characterize the minimax optimal mechanisms for general $f$-divergences provided that $p$ and $q$ are discrete distributions. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this optimal mechanism is universal across all $f$-divergences. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our minimax optimal sampler compared to the state-of-the-art locally private sampler.</p></details> |  |

However, as grids expand and operate closer to their limits, iterative power flow solvers, central to QSTS simulations, become computationally prohibitive and face increasing convergence issues. Neural power flow solvers provide a promising alternative, speeding up power flow computations by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude, though they are costly to train. In this paper, we envision how recently introduced grid foundation models could improve the economic viability of neural power flow solvers. Conceptually, these models amortize training costs by serving as a foundation for a range of grid operation and planning tasks beyond power flow solving, with only minimal fine-tuning required. We call for collaboration between the AI and power grid communities to develop and open-source these models, enabling all operators, even those with limited resources, to benefit from AI without building solutions from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributors: A.P. and F.M.; Lead contact: A.P</p></details> |

We used two anthropomorphic hands and two 2-finger grippers to grasp two sets of deformable objects. On the object classification task, we found: (i) among classifiers, SVM on sensory features and LSTM on raw time series performed best across all grippers; (ii) faster compression speeds degraded performance; (iii) generalization to different grasping configurations was limited; transfer to different compression speeds worked well for the Barrett Hand only. Visualization of the feature spaces using PCA showed that gripper morphology and action parameters were the main source of variance, making generalization across embodiment or grip configurations very difficult. On the highly challenging dataset consisting of polyurethane foams alone, only the Barrett Hand achieved excellent performance. Tactile sensors can thus provide a key advantage even if recognition is based on stiffness rather than shape. The data set with 24,000 measurements is publicly available.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Quantifying Qualitative Insights: Leveraging LLMs to Market Predict](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08404v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to transform financial analytics by integrating numerical and textual data. However, challenges such as insufficient context when fusing multimodal information and the difficulty in measuring the utility of qualitative outputs, which LLMs generate as text, have limited their effectiveness in tasks such as financial forecasting. This study addresses these challenges by leveraging daily reports from securities firms to create high-quality contextual information. The reports are segmented into text-based key factors and combined with numerical data, such as price information, to form context sets. By dynamically updating few-shot examples based on the query time, the sets incorporate the latest information, forming a highly relevant set closely aligned with the query point. Additionally, a crafted prompt is designed to assign scores to the key factors, converting qualitative insights into quantitative results. The derived scores undergo a scaling process, transforming them into real-world values that are used for prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs outperform time-series models in market forecasting, though challenges such as imperfect reproducibility and limited explainability remain.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Previous efforts to represent time series signal data in natural language have had challenges in designing a conventional class of time series signal characteristics, formulating their quantification, and creating a dictionary of synonyms. To overcome these limitations, the proposed method introduces a neural network based on contrastive learning. This network is first trained using the datasets TRUCE and SUSHI, which consist of time series signals and their corresponding natural language descriptions. Previous studies have proposed vocabularies that data analysts use to describe signal characteristics, and SUSHI was designed to cover these terms. We believe that a neural network trained on these datasets will enable data analysts to search using natural language vocabulary. Furthermore, our method does not require a dictionary of predefined synonyms, and it leverages common sense knowledge embedded in a large-scale language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate that CLaSP enables natural language search of time series signal data and can accurately learn the points at which signal data changes.</p></details> |  |

Due to the abundant seasonal information they contain, timestamps possess the potential to offer robust global guidance for forecasting techniques. However, existing works primarily focus on local observations, with timestamps being treated merely as an optional supplement that remains underutilized. When data gathered from the real world is polluted, the absence of global information will damage the robust prediction capability of these algorithms. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named GLAFF. Within this framework, the timestamps are modeled individually to capture the global dependencies. Working as a plugin, GLAFF adaptively adjusts the combined weights for global and local information, enabling seamless collaboration with any time series forecasting backbone. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that GLAFF significantly enhances the average performance of widely used mainstream forecasting models by 12.5%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by 5.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

The advent of time-series foundation models (TSFM), such as Chronos, and the need for effective zero-shot forecasting performance across various time-series domains motivates the question: Do benefits of RAG similarly carry over to time series forecasting? In this paper, we advocate that the dynamic and event-driven nature of time-series data makes RAG a crucial component of TSFMs and introduce a principled RAG framework for time-series forecasting, called Retrieval Augmented Forecasting (RAF). Within RAF, we develop efficient strategies for retrieving related time-series examples and incorporating them into forecast. Through experiments and mechanistic studies, we demonstrate that RAF indeed improves the forecasting accuracy across diverse time series domains and the improvement is more significant for larger TSFM sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynapsNet: Enhancing Neuronal Population Dynamics Modeling via Learning Functional Connectivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08221v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The availability of large-scale neuronal population datasets necessitates new methods to model population dynamics and extract interpretable, scientifically translatable insights. Existing deep learning methods often overlook the biological mechanisms underlying population activity and thus exhibit suboptimal performance with neuronal data and provide little to no interpretable information about neurons and their interactions. In response, we introduce SynapsNet, a novel deep-learning framework that effectively models population dynamics and functional interactions between neurons. Within this biologically realistic framework, each neuron, characterized by a latent embedding, sends and receives currents through directed connections. A shared decoder uses the input current, previous neuronal activity, neuron embedding, and behavioral data to predict the population activity in the next time step. Unlike common sequential models that treat population activity as a multichannel time series, SynapsNet applies its decoder to each neuron (channel) individually, with the learnable functional connectivity serving as the sole pathway for information flow between neurons. Our experiments, conducted on mouse cortical activity from publicly available datasets and recorded using the two most common population recording modalities (Ca imaging and Neuropixels) across three distinct tasks, demonstrate that SynapsNet consistently outperforms existing models in forecasting population activity. Additionally, our experiments on both real and synthetic data showed that SynapsNet accurately learns functional connectivity that reveals predictive interactions between neurons.</p></details> |  |

This setting is primarily applicable in Natural Language Processing (NLP), as a token embedding function (where a bounded number of tokens is admitted) is first applied before feeding the input to the transformer. On certain kinds of data (e.g. time series), we want our transformers to be able to handle arbitrary input sequences of numbers (or tuples thereof) without a priori limiting the values of these numbers. In this paper, we initiate the study of the expressive power of transformer encoders on sequences of data (i.e. tuples of numbers). Our results indicate an increase in expressive power of hard attention transformers over data sequences, in stark contrast to the case of strings. In particular, we prove that Unique Hard Attention Transformers (UHAT) over inputs as data sequences no longer lie within the circuit complexity class $AC^0$ (even without positional encodings), unlike the case of string inputs, but are still within the complexity class $TC^0$ (even with positional encodings). Over strings, UHAT without positional encodings capture only regular languages. In contrast, we show that over data sequences UHAT can capture non-regular properties. Finally, we show that UHAT capture languages definable in an extension of linear temporal logic with unary numeric predicates and arithmetics.</p></details> |  |

When the class values are ordinal, classifiers that take this into account can perform better than nominal classifiers. Time Series Ordinal Classification (TSOC) is the field covering this gap, yet unexplored in the literature. There are a wide range of time series problems showing an ordered label structure, and TSC techniques that ignore the order relationship discard useful information. Hence, this paper presents a first benchmarking of TSOC methodologies, exploiting the ordering of the target labels to boost the performance of current TSC state-of-the-art. Both convolutional- and deep learning-based methodologies (among the best performing alternatives for nominal TSC) are adapted for TSOC. For the experiments, a selection of 29 ordinal problems from two well-known archives has been made. In this way, this paper contributes to the establishment of the state-of-the-art in TSOC. The results obtained by ordinal versions are found to be significantly better than current nominal TSC techniques in terms of ordinal performance metrics, outlining the importance of considering the ordering of the labels when dealing with this kind of problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Concurrently, the world is slowly shifting its focus towards more sustainable computing. For these reasons, there has been a recent effort to reduce the footprint of related computing infrastructure, especially by deep learning algorithms, for advanced insight generation. The `TinyML' community is actively proposing methods to save communication bandwidth and excessive cloud storage costs while reducing algorithm inference latency and promoting data privacy. Such proposed approaches should ideally process multiple types of data, including time series, audio, satellite images, and video, near the network edge as multiple data streams has been shown to improve the discriminative ability of learning algorithms, especially for generating fine grained results. Incidentally, there has been recent work on data driven conditional computation of subnetworks that has shown real progress in using a single model to share parameters among very different types of inputs such as images and text, reducing the computation requirement of multi-tower multimodal networks. Inspired by such line of work, we explore similar per patch conditional computation for the first time for mobile vision transformers (vision only case), that will eventually be used for single-tower multimodal edge models. We evaluate the model on Cornell Sap Sucker Woods 60, a fine grained bird species discrimination dataset. Our initial experiments uses $4X$ fewer parameters compared to MobileViTV2-1.0 with a $1$% accuracy drop on the iNaturalist '21 birds test data provided as part of the SSW60 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Clinical Reasoning through Knowledge-augmented Rationale Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07611v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical rationales play a pivotal role in accurate disease diagnosis; however, many models predominantly use discriminative methods and overlook the importance of generating supportive rationales. Rationale distillation is a process that transfers knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to smaller language models (SLMs), thereby enhancing the latter's ability to break down complex tasks. Despite its benefits, rationale distillation alone is inadequate for addressing domain knowledge limitations in tasks requiring specialized expertise, such as disease diagnosis. Effectively embedding domain knowledge in SLMs poses a significant challenge. While current LLMs are primarily geared toward processing textual data, multimodal LLMs that incorporate time series data, especially electronic health records (EHRs), are still evolving. To tackle these limitations, we introduce ClinRaGen, an SLM optimized for multimodal rationale generation in disease diagnosis. ClinRaGen incorporates a unique knowledge-augmented attention mechanism to merge domain knowledge with time series EHR data, utilizing a stepwise rationale distillation strategy to produce both textual and time series-based clinical rationales. Our evaluations show that ClinRaGen markedly improves the SLM's capability to interpret multimodal EHR data and generate accurate clinical rationales, supporting more reliable disease diagnosis, advancing LLM applications in healthcare, and narrowing the performance divide between LLMs and SLMs.</p></details> | 11 pages. 4 figures |

| **[FM-TS: Flow Matching for Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07506v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation has emerged as an essential tool for analyzing temporal data across numerous fields. While diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in generating high-quality time series, they tend to be computationally demanding and reliant on complex stochastic processes. To address these limitations, we introduce FM-TS, a rectified Flow Matching-based framework for Time Series generation, which simplifies the time series generation process by directly optimizing continuous trajectories. This approach avoids the need for iterative sampling or complex noise schedules typically required in diffusion-based models. FM-TS is more efficient in terms of training and inference. Moreover, FM-TS is highly adaptive, supporting both conditional and unconditional time series generation. Notably, through our novel inference design, the model trained in an unconditional setting can seamlessly generalize to conditional tasks without the need for retraining. Extensive benchmarking across both settings demonstrates that FM-TS consistently delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches while being more efficient in terms of training and inference. For instance, in terms of discriminative score, FM-TS achieves 0.005, 0.019, 0.011, 0.005, 0.053, and 0.106 on the Sines, Stocks, ETTh, MuJoCo, Energy, and fMRI unconditional time series datasets, respectively, significantly outperforming the second-best method which achieves 0.006, 0.067, 0.061, 0.008, 0.122, and 0.167 on the same datasets. We have achieved superior performance in solar forecasting and MuJoCo imputation tasks, significantly enhanced by our innovative $t$ power sampling method.

To address these limitations, we propose SimTS, a simple representation learning approach for improving time series forecasting by learning to predict the future from the past in the latent space. SimTS exclusively uses positive pairs and does not depend on negative pairs or specific characteristics of a given time series. In addition, we show the shortcomings of the current contrastive learning framework used for time series forecasting through a detailed ablation study. Overall, our work suggests that SimTS is a promising alternative to other contrastive learning approaches for time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version.

Previous studies in time series continual learning often propose models that require buffering of long sequences, potentially restricting the responsiveness of the inference system. Moreover, these models are typically designed for regularly sampled data, an unrealistic assumption in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces ODEStream, a novel buffer-free continual learning framework that incorporates a temporal isolation layer that integrates temporal dependencies within the data. Simultaneously, it leverages the capability of neural ordinary differential equations to process irregular sequences and generate a continuous data representation, enabling seamless adaptation to changing dynamics in a data streaming scenario. Our approach focuses on learning how the dynamics and distribution of historical data change with time, facilitating the direct processing of streaming sequences. Evaluations on benchmark real-world datasets demonstrate that ODEStream outperforms the state-of-the-art online learning and streaming analysis baselines, providing accurate predictions over extended periods while minimising performance degradation over time by learning how the sequence dynamics change.</p></details> |  |

A model of a physiological neuron based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is considered. Single time series of one of its variables is shown to be enough to train a neural network that can operate as a discrete time dynamical system with one control parameter. The neural network system is created in two steps. First, the delay-coordinate embedding vectors are constructed form the original time series and their dimension is reduced with by means of a variational autoencoder to obtain the recovered state-space vectors. It is shown that an appropriate reduced dimension can be determined by analyzing the autoencoder training process. Second, pairs of the recovered state-space vectors at consecutive time steps supplied with a constant value playing the role of a control parameter are used to train another neural network to make it operate as a recurrent map. The regimes of thus created neural network system observed when its control parameter is varied are in very good accordance with those of the original system, though they were not explicitly presented during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose an approach utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict satellite clock bias. We gather data from the PRN 8 satellite of the Galileo and preprocess it to obtain a single difference sequence, crucial for normalizing the data. Normalization allows resampling of the data, ensuring that the predictions are equidistant and complete. Our methodology involves training the LSTM model on varying lengths of datasets, ranging from 7 days to 31 days. We employ a training set consisting of two days' worth of data in each case. Our LSTM model exhibits exceptional accuracy, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.11 $\times$ 10$^{-11}$. Notably, our approach outperforms traditional methods used for similar time-series forecasting projects, being 170 times more accurate than RNN, 2.3 $\times$ 10$^7$ times more accurate than MLP, and 1.9 $\times$ 10$^4$ times more accurate than ARIMA. This study holds significant potential in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of low-power receivers used in various devices, particularly those requiring power conservation. By providing more accurate predictions of satellite clock bias, the findings of this research can be integrated into the algorithms of such devices, enabling them to function with heightened precision while conserving power. Improved accuracy in clock bias predictions ensures that low-power receivers can maintain optimal performance levels, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and effectiveness of satellite navigation systems. Consequently, this advancement holds promise for a wide range of applications, including remote areas, IoT devices, wearable technology, and other devices where power efficiency and navigation accuracy are paramount.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 6 figures (8 sub-figures), 5 Tables Index Terms-LSTM, Satellite Navigation, Deep Learning, Clock Bias</p></details> |

This lack of transparency hinders trust and reliability in industrial applications. Heuristic attribution methods, while helpful, often fail to capture true causal relationships, leading to inaccurate error attributions. Various root-cause analysis methods have been developed using Shapley values, yet they typically require predefined causal graphs, limiting their applicability for prediction errors in machine learning models. To address these limitations, we introduce the Causal-Discovery-based Root-Cause Analysis (CD-RCA) method that estimates causal relationships between the prediction error and the explanatory variables, without needing a pre-defined causal graph. By simulating synthetic error data, CD-RCA can identify variable contributions to outliers in prediction errors by Shapley values. Extensive simulations show CD-RCA outperforms current heuristic attribution methods, and a sensitivity analysis reveals new patterns where Shapley values may misattribute errors, paving the way for more accurate error attribution methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages with 5 figures</p></details> |

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formulated by the United Nations in 2015 to address these global challenges by 2030. Natural language processing techniques can help uncover discussions on SDGs within research literature. We propose a completely automated pipeline to 1) fetch content from the Scopus database and prepare datasets dedicated to five groups of SDGs; 2) perform topic modeling, a statistical technique used to identify topics in large collections of textual data; and 3) enable topic exploration through keywords-based search and topic frequency time series extraction. For topic modeling, we leverage the stack of BERTopic scaled up to be applied on large corpora of textual documents (we find hundreds of topics on hundreds of thousands of documents), introducing i) a novel LLM-based embeddings computation for representing scientific abstracts in the continuous space and ii) a hyperparameter optimizer to efficiently find the best configuration for any new big datasets. We additionally produce the visualization of results on interactive dashboards reporting topics' temporal evolution. Results are made inspectable and explorable, contributing to the interpretability of the topic modeling process. Our proposed LLM-based topic modeling pipeline for big-text datasets allows users to capture insights on the evolution of the attitude toward SDGs within scientific abstracts in the 2006-2023 time span. All the results are reproducible by using our system; the workflow can be generalized to be applied at any point in time to any big corpus of textual documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Counterfactual explanations, which provide insights by presenting alternative inputs that change model predictions, offer a promising solution. However, existing methods for generating counterfactual explanations for time-series data often struggle with balancing key objectives like proximity, sparsity, and validity. In this paper, we introduce TX-Gen, a novel algorithm for generating counterfactual explanations based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). TX-Gen leverages evolutionary multi-objective optimization to find a diverse set of counterfactuals that are both sparse and valid, while maintaining minimal dissimilarity to the original time series. By incorporating a flexible reference-guided mechanism, our method improves the plausibility and interpretability of the counterfactuals without relying on predefined assumptions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TX-Gen outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality counterfactuals, making time-series models more transparent and interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EXPLAINS 2024</p></details> |

Traditional methods employ mechanistic models like the SIR family, which make strong assumptions about the underlying spreading process, often represented as a small set of compact differential equations. Data-driven methods such as deep neural networks make no such assumptions and can capture the generative process in more detail, but fail in long-term forecasting due to data limitations. We propose a new hybrid method called MP-PINN (Multi-Phase Physics-Informed Neural Network) to overcome the limitations of these two major approaches. MP-PINN instils the spreading mechanism into a neural network, enabling the mechanism to update in phases over time, reflecting the dynamics of the epidemics due to policy interventions. Experiments on COVID-19 waves demonstrate that MP-PINN achieves superior performance over pure data-driven or model-driven approaches for both short-term and long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |

The performance of traditional methods is limited by their dependence on complex feature extraction and skilled expert knowledge, which can be time-consuming and subjective. This paper proposes a novel intelligent fault diagnosis method for NPPs that combines enhanced temporal convolutional network (ETCN) with sparrow search algorithm (SSA). ETCN utilizes temporal convolutional network (TCN), self-attention (SA) mechanism and residual block for enhancing performance. ETCN excels at extracting local features and capturing time series information, while SSA adaptively optimizes its hyperparameters for superior performance. The proposed method's performance is experimentally verified on a CPR1000 simulation dataset. Compared to other advanced intelligent fault diagnosis methods, the proposed one demonstrates superior performance across all evaluation metrics. This makes it a promising tool for NPP intelligent fault diagnosis, ultimately enhancing operational reliability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop TimeText Corpus (TTC), a carefully curated, time-aligned text and time dataset for multimodal forecasting. Our dataset is composed of sequences of numbers and text aligned to timestamps, and includes data from two different domains: climate science and healthcare. Our data is a significant contribution to the rare selection of available multimodal datasets. We also propose the Hybrid Multi-Modal Forecaster (Hybrid-MMF), a multimodal LLM that jointly forecasts both text and time series data using shared embeddings. However, contrary to our expectations, our Hybrid-MMF model does not outperform existing baselines in our experiments. This negative result highlights the challenges inherent in multimodal forecasting.

However, the advancement of these models has been hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce the General Time Series Forecasting Model Evaluation, GIFT-Eval, a pioneering benchmark aimed at promoting evaluation across diverse datasets. GIFT-Eval encompasses 23 datasets over 144,000 time series and 177 million data points, spanning seven domains, 10 frequencies, multivariate inputs, and prediction lengths ranging from short to long-term forecasts. To facilitate the effective pretraining and evaluation of foundation models, we also provide a non-leaking pretraining dataset containing approximately 230 billion data points. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of 17 baselines, which includes statistical models, deep learning models, and foundation models. We discuss each model in the context of various benchmark characteristics and offer a qualitative analysis that spans both deep learning and foundation models. We believe the insights from this analysis, along with access to this new standard zero-shot time series forecasting benchmark, will guide future developments in time series foundation models.

| **[TimeXer: Empowering Transformers for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19072v4)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models have demonstrated remarkable performance in time series forecasting. However, due to the partially-observed nature of real-world applications, solely focusing on the target of interest, so-called endogenous variables, is usually insufficient to guarantee accurate forecasting. Notably, a system is often recorded into multiple variables, where the exogenous variables can provide valuable external information for endogenous variables. Thus, unlike well-established multivariate or univariate forecasting paradigms that either treat all the variables equally or ignore exogenous information, this paper focuses on a more practical setting: time series forecasting with exogenous variables. We propose a novel approach, TimeXer, to ingest external information to enhance the forecasting of endogenous variables. With deftly designed embedding layers, TimeXer empowers the canonical Transformer with the ability to reconcile endogenous and exogenous information, where patch-wise self-attention and variate-wise cross-attention are used simultaneously. Moreover, global endogenous tokens are learned to effectively bridge the causal information underlying exogenous series into endogenous temporal patches. Experimentally, TimeXer achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on twelve real-world forecasting benchmarks and exhibits notable generality and scalability. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/TimeXer.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains unclear whether their success stems from a true understanding of temporal dynamics or simply from memorizing the training data. While implicit reasoning in language models has been studied, similar evaluations for time series models have been largely unexplored. This work takes an initial step toward assessing the reasoning abilities of deep time series forecasting models. We find that certain linear, MLP-based, and patch-based Transformer models generalize effectively in systematically orchestrated out-of-distribution scenarios, suggesting underexplored reasoning capabilities beyond simple pattern memorization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditioning non-linear and infinite-dimensional diffusion processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01434v2)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models and many stochastic models in science and engineering naturally live in infinite dimensions before discretisation. To incorporate observed data for statistical and learning tasks, one needs to condition on observations. While recent work has treated conditioning linear processes in infinite dimensions, conditioning non-linear processes in infinite dimensions has not been explored. This paper conditions function valued stochastic processes without prior discretisation. To do so, we use an infinite-dimensional version of Girsanov's theorem to condition a function-valued stochastic process, leading to a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the conditioned process involving the score. We apply this technique to do time series analysis for shapes of organisms in evolutionary biology, where we discretise via the Fourier basis and then learn the coefficients of the score function with score matching methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local vs. Global Models for Hierarchical Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06394v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical time series forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making in various domains while presenting significant challenges for modelling as they involve multiple levels of aggregation, constraints, and availability of information. This study explores the influence of distinct information utilisation on the accuracy of hierarchical forecasts, proposing and evaluating locals and a range of Global Forecasting Models (GFMs). In contrast to local models, which forecast each series independently, we develop GFMs to exploit cross-series and cross-hierarchies information, improving both forecasting performance and computational efficiency. We employ reconciliation methods to ensure coherency in forecasts and use the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) and Multiple Comparisons with the Best (MCB) tests to assess statistical significance. The findings indicate that GFMs possess significant advantages for hierarchical forecasting, providing more accurate and computationally efficient solutions across different levels in a hierarchy. Two specific GFMs based on LightGBM are introduced, demonstrating superior accuracy and lower model complexity than their counterpart local models and conventional methods such as Exponential Smoothing (ES) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).</p></details> |  |

Tsutsumi, K. Nakai and Y. Saiki, Chaos 32, 091101 (2022)], we proposed a method for constructing a system of differential equations of chaotic behavior from only observable deterministic time series, which we call the radial function-based regression (RfR) method. However, when the targeted variable's behavior is rather complex, the direct application of the RfR method does not function well. In this study, we propose a novel method of modeling such dynamics, including the high-frequency intermittent behavior of a fluid flow, by considering another variable (base variable) showing relatively simple, less intermittent behavior. We construct an autonomous joint model composed of two parts: the first is an autonomous system of a base variable, and the other concerns the targeted variable being affected by a term involving the base variable to demonstrate complex dynamics. The constructed joint model succeeded in not only inferring a short trajectory but also reconstructing chaotic sets and statistical properties obtained from a long trajectory such as the density distributions of the actual dynamics.</p></details> | 7pages, 6figures |

A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs.</p></details> | in NeuRIPS 2024 |

Synthesizing the sound received at any position relies on the estimation of impulse response (IR), which characterizes how sound propagates in one scene along different paths before arriving at the listener's position. In this paper, we present Acoustic Volume Rendering (AVR), a novel approach that adapts volume rendering techniques to model acoustic impulse responses. While volume rendering has been successful in modeling radiance fields for images and neural scene representations, IRs present unique challenges as time-series signals. To address these challenges, we introduce frequency-domain volume rendering and use spherical integration to fit the IR measurements. Our method constructs an impulse response field that inherently encodes wave propagation principles and achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing impulse responses for novel poses. Experiments show that AVR surpasses current leading methods by a substantial margin. Additionally, we develop an acoustic simulation platform, AcoustiX, which provides more accurate and realistic IR simulations than existing simulators.

Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future work.

However, periodicity is a crucial trait in various forms of reasoning and generalization, underpinning predictability across natural and engineered systems through recurring patterns in observations. In this paper, we propose FAN, a novel network architecture based on Fourier Analysis, which empowers the ability to efficiently model and reason about periodic phenomena. By introducing Fourier Series, the periodicity is naturally integrated into the structure and computational processes of the neural network, thus achieving a more accurate expression and prediction of periodic patterns. As a promising substitute to multi-layer perceptron (MLP), FAN can seamlessly replace MLP in various models with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FAN in modeling and reasoning about periodic functions, and the superiority and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks, including symbolic formula representation, time series forecasting, and language modeling.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we aim to better understand how the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning shapes downstream generalization. Our analysis focuses on reasoning tasks, whose problem structure allows us to distinguish between memorization (the exact replication of reasoning steps from the training data) and performance (the correctness of the final solution). We find that a model's generalization behavior can be effectively characterized by a training metric we call pre-memorization train accuracy: the accuracy of model samples on training queries before they begin to copy the exact reasoning steps from the training set. On the dataset level, this metric is able to reliably predict test accuracy, achieving $R^2$ of around or exceeding 0.9 across various models (Llama3 8, Gemma2 9B), datasets (GSM8k, MATH), and training configurations. On a per-example level, this metric is also indicative of whether individual model predictions are robust to perturbations in the training query. By connecting a model's learning behavior to its generalization, pre-memorization train accuracy can guide targeted improvements to training strategies. We focus on data curation as an example, and show that prioritizing examples with low pre-memorization accuracy leads to 1.5-2x improvements in data efficiency compared to i.i.d. data scaling, and outperforms other standard data curation techniques.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces sMoRe (Spatial Mapping and Object Rendering Environment), an MR application that combines Generative AI (GenAI) with large language models (LLMs) to assist users in creating, placing, and managing virtual objects within physical spaces. sMoRe allows users to use voice or typed text commands to create and place virtual objects using GenAI while specifying spatial constraints. The system leverages LLMs to interpret users' commands, analyze the current scene, and identify optimal locations.

However, current research largely relies on manual, task-specific design, limiting their adaptability to novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new research problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular design space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental modules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory. Building on this design space, we present a novel LLM agent search framework called AgentSquare, which introduces two core mechanisms, i.e., module evolution and recombination, to efficiently search for optimized LLM agents. To further accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses in-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web, embodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially outperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2% against best-known human designs. Moreover, AgentSquare can generate interpretable design insights, enabling a deeper understanding of agentic architecture and its impact on task performance. We believe that the modular design space and AgentSquare search framework offer a platform for fully exploiting the potential of prior successful designs and consolidating the collective efforts of research community.

Yet the substantial memory footprint of LLMs significantly hinders their deployment. In this paper, we improve the accessibility of LLMs through BitMoD, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution that enables efficient LLM acceleration at low weight precision. On the algorithm side, BitMoD introduces fine-grained data type adaptation that uses a different numerical data type to quantize a group of (e.g., 128) weights. Through the careful design of these new data types, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to very low precision (e.g., 4 bits and 3 bits) while maintaining high accuracy. On the hardware side, BitMoD employs a bit-serial processing element to easily support multiple numerical precisions and data types; our hardware design includes two key innovations: First, it employs a unified representation to process different weight data types, thus reducing the hardware cost. Second, it adopts a bit-serial dequantization unit to rescale the per-group partial sum with minimal hardware overhead. Our evaluation on six representative LLMs demonstrates that BitMoD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM quantization and acceleration methods. For discriminative tasks, BitMoD can quantize LLM weights to 4-bit with $<\!0.5\%$ accuracy loss on average. For generative tasks, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to 3-bit while achieving better perplexity than prior LLM quantization scheme. Combining the superior model performance with an efficient accelerator design, BitMoD achieves an average of $1.69\times$ and $1.48\times$ speedups compared to prior LLM accelerators ANT and OliVe, respectively.</p></details> | HPCA 2025 |
| **[Technical Report: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Reward-guided Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11694v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, test-time scaling has garnered significant attention from the research community, largely due to the substantial advancements of the o1 model released by OpenAI. By allocating more computational resources during the inference phase, large language models~(LLMs) can extensively explore the solution space by generating more thought tokens or diverse solutions, thereby producing more accurate responses. However, developing an o1-like reasoning approach is challenging, and researchers have been making various attempts to advance this open area of research. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration into enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs through reward-guided tree search algorithms. This framework is implemented by integrating the policy model, reward model, and search algorithm. It is primarily constructed around a tree search algorithm, where the policy model navigates a dynamically expanding tree guided by a specially trained reward model. We thoroughly explore various design considerations necessary for implementing this framework and provide a detailed report of the technical aspects. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we focus on mathematical reasoning tasks and conduct extensive evaluations on four challenging datasets, significantly enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>LLM;C...</summary><p>LLM;Complex Reasoning;Math</p></details> |

The field of knowledge-based requirements engineering (KBRE) aims to support engineers by providing knowledge to assist in the elicitation, validation, and management of system requirements. The advent of large language models (LLMs) opens new opportunities in the field of KBRE. This work experimentally investigates the potential of LLMs in requirements verification. Therein, LLMs are provided with a set of requirements and a textual system specification and are prompted to assess which requirements are fulfilled by the system specification. Different experimental variables such as system specification complexity, the number of requirements, and prompting strategies were analyzed. Formal rule-based systems serve as a benchmark to compare LLM performance to. Requirements and system specifications are derived from the smart-grid domain. Results show that advanced LLMs, like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieved f1-scores between 79 % and 94 % in identifying non-fulfilled requirements, indicating potential for LLMs to be leveraged for requirements verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 3rd IEEE Industrial Electronics Society Annual Online Conference (ONCON)</p></details> |
| **[Topology-aware Preemptive Scheduling for Co-located LLM Workloads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11560v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hosting diverse large language model workloads in a unified resource pool through co-location is cost-effective. For example, long-running chat services generally follow diurnal traffic patterns, which inspire co-location of batch jobs to fulfill resource valleys between successive peaks, and thus to saturate resource allocation in cluster-wide scope. These heterogeneous workloads often have different business priorities, and therefore preemption can be leveraged for resource elasticity. However, workloads often have distinct topology preferences as well. The resources released by lower-priority instances may fail to meet the requirements of high-priority online services which are usually latency-sensitive. The root cause behind such mis-match is a lack of topology awareness of resource scheduler, especially during preemption. To bridge this gap, we develop a fine-grained topology-aware method for preemptive scheduling of hybrid workloads. The method ensures that the resources freed by preempted tasks adhere to the topological affinity needs of high-priority preemptors in a guaranteed or best-effort manner. This dynamic alignment significantly increases the efficiency of preemption and improves overall scheduled performance for LLM workloads by $55\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 Pa...</summary><p>17 Pages, 11 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Fuzz testing, a cornerstone for improving software reliability and detecting vulnerabilities, often relies on manually written fuzz drivers, limiting scalability and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose CodeGraphGPT, a novel system that integrates code knowledge graphs with an LLM-powered intelligent agent to automate the fuzz driver generation process. By framing fuzz driver creation as a code generation task, CodeGraphGPT leverages program analysis to construct a knowledge graph of code repositories, where nodes represent code entities, such as functions or files, and edges capture their relationships. This enables the system to generate tailored fuzz drivers and input seeds, resolve compilation errors, and analyze crash reports, all while adapting to specific API usage scenarios. Additionally, querying the knowledge graph helps identify precise testing targets and contextualize the purpose of each fuzz driver within the fuzzing loop. We evaluated CodeGraphGPT on eight open-source software projects, achieving an average improvement of 8.73\% in code coverage compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, it reduced the manual workload in crash case analysis by 84.4\% and identified 11 real-world bugs, including nine previously unreported ones. This work highlights how integrating LLMs with code knowledge graphs enhances fuzz driver generation, offering an efficient solution for vulnerability detection and software quality improvement.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Conversational agents, often referred to as AI chatbots, rely heavily on such data to train large language models (LLMs) and generate new content (knowledge) in response to user prompts. With the advent of OpenAI's ChatGPT, LLM-based chatbots have set new standards in the AI community. This paper presents a complete survey of the evolution and deployment of LLM-based chatbots in various sectors. We first summarize the development of foundational chatbots, followed by the evolution of LLMs, and then provide an overview of LLM-based chatbots currently in use and those in the development phase. Recognizing AI chatbots as tools for generating new knowledge, we explore their diverse applications across various industries. We then discuss the open challenges, considering how the data used to train the LLMs and the misuse of the generated knowledge can cause several issues. Finally, we explore the future outlook to augment their efficiency and reliability in numerous applications. By addressing key milestones and the present-day context of LLM-based chatbots, our survey invites readers to delve deeper into this realm, reflecting on how their next generation will reshape conversational AI.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Preempting Text Sanitization Utility in Resource-Constrained Privacy-Preserving LLM Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11521v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individuals have been increasingly interacting with online Large Language Models (LLMs), both in their work and personal lives. These interactions raise privacy issues as the LLMs are typically hosted by third-parties who can gather a variety of sensitive information about users and their companies. Text Sanitization techniques have been proposed in the literature and can be used to sanitize user prompts before sending them to the LLM. However, sanitization has an impact on the downstream task performed by the LLM, and often to such an extent that it leads to unacceptable results for the user. This is not just a minor annoyance, with clear monetary consequences as LLM services charge on a per use basis as well as great amount of computing resources wasted. We propose an architecture leveraging a Small Language Model (SLM) at the user-side to help estimate the impact of sanitization on a prompt before it is sent to the LLM, thus preventing resource losses. Our evaluation of this architecture revealed a significant problem with text sanitization based on Differential Privacy, on which we want to draw the attention of the community for further investigation.</p></details> |  |

As the LLM app ecosystem continues to evolve, it is crucial to understand the current landscape and identify potential areas for future research and development. This paper presents a forward-looking analysis of LLM app stores, focusing on key aspects such as data mining, security risk identification, development assistance, and market dynamics. Our comprehensive examination extends to the intricate relationships between various stakeholders and the technological advancements driving the ecosystem's growth. We explore the ethical considerations and potential societal impacts of widespread LLM app adoption, highlighting the need for responsible innovation and governance frameworks. By examining these aspects, we aim to provide a vision for future research directions and highlight the importance of collaboration among stakeholders to address the challenges and opportunities within the LLM app ecosystem. The insights and recommendations provided in this paper serve as a foundation for driving innovation, ensuring responsible development, and creating a thriving, user-centric LLM app landscape.</p></details> |  |

LLMs have been shown to easily reproduce parts of their training data, including copyrighted work. This is an important problem to solve, as it may violate existing copyright laws as well as the European AI Act. In this work, we propose a systematic analysis to quantify the extent of potential copyright infringements in LLMs using European law as an example. Unlike previous work, we evaluate instruction-finetuned models in a realistic end-user scenario. Our analysis builds on a proposed threshold of 160 characters, which we borrow from the German Copyright Service Provider Act and a fuzzy text matching algorithm to identify potentially copyright-infringing textual reproductions. The specificity of countermeasures against copyright infringement is analyzed by comparing model behavior on copyrighted and public domain data. We investigate what behaviors models show instead of producing protected text (such as refusal or hallucination) and provide a first legal assessment of these behaviors. We find that there are huge differences in copyright compliance, specificity, and appropriate refusal among popular LLMs. Alpaca, GPT 4, GPT 3.5, and Luminous perform best in our comparison, with OpenGPT-X, Alpaca, and Luminous producing a particularly low absolute number of potential copyright violations.

In response, we propose a new defense strategy tailored to counter LLM-driven cyberattacks. We introduce Mantis, a defensive framework that exploits LLMs' susceptibility to adversarial inputs to undermine malicious operations. Upon detecting an automated cyberattack, Mantis plants carefully crafted inputs into system responses, leading the attacker's LLM to disrupt their own operations (passive defense) or even compromise the attacker's machine (active defense). By deploying purposefully vulnerable decoy services to attract the attacker and using dynamic prompt injections for the attacker's LLM, Mantis can autonomously hack back the attacker. In our experiments, Mantis consistently achieved over 95% effectiveness against automated LLM-driven attacks. To foster further research and collaboration, Mantis is available as an open-source tool: https://github.com/pasquini-dario/project_mantis</p></details> | <details><summary>v0.2 ...</summary><p>v0.2 (evaluated on more agents)</p></details> |

In this study, we propose Grounded 3D-LLM, which explores the potential of 3D large multi-modal models (3D LMMs) to consolidate various 3D vision tasks within a unified generative framework. The model uses scene referent tokens as special noun phrases to reference 3D scenes, enabling it to handle sequences that interleave 3D and textual data. Per-task instruction-following templates are employed to ensure natural and diversity in translating 3D vision tasks into language formats. To facilitate the use of referent tokens in subsequent language modeling, we provide a large-scale, automatically curated grounded scene-text dataset with over 1 million phrase-to-region correspondences and introduce Contrastive Language-Scene Pre-training (CLASP) to perform phrase-level scene-text alignment using this data. Our comprehensive evaluation covers open-ended tasks like dense captioning and 3D question answering, alongside close-ended tasks such as object detection and language grounding. Experiments across multiple 3D benchmarks reveal the leading performance and the broad applicability of Grounded 3D-LLM.

However, existing approaches either disregard or ineffectively model the user-item high-order interactions. To this end, this paper presents an enhanced LLM-based recommender (ELMRec). We enhance whole-word embeddings to substantially enhance LLMs' interpretation of graph-constructed interactions for recommendations, without requiring graph pre-training. This finding may inspire endeavors to incorporate rich knowledge graphs into LLM-based recommenders via whole-word embedding. We also found that LLMs often recommend items based on users' earlier interactions rather than recent ones, and present a reranking solution. Our ELMRec outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both direct and sequential recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Long ...</summary><p>Long paper accepted to EMNLP 2024 Main. 16 pages</p></details> |

While these feature engineering techniques are effective, they typically depend on a pre-defined search space and primarily use validation scores for feature selection, thereby missing valuable insights from previous experiments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel tabular learning framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs), termed Optimizing Column feature generator with decision Tree reasoning (OCTree). Our key idea is to leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to identify effective feature generation rules without manually specifying the search space and provide language-based reasoning information highlighting past experiments as feedback for iterative rule improvements. We use decision trees to convey this reasoning information, as they can be easily represented in natural language, effectively providing knowledge from prior experiments (i.e., the impact of the generated features on performance) to the LLMs. Our empirical results demonstrate that OCTree consistently enhances the performance of various prediction models across diverse benchmarks, outperforming competing automated feature engineering methods.

However, their performance in low-resource language translation, particularly when translating into these languages, remains underexplored. This gap poses significant challenges, as linguistic barriers hinder the cultural preservation and development of minority communities. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel retrieval-based method that enhances translation quality for low-resource languages by focusing on key terms, which involves translating keywords and retrieving corresponding examples from existing data. To evaluate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted experiments translating from English into three low-resource languages: Cherokee, a critically endangered indigenous language of North America; Tibetan, a historically and culturally significant language in Asia; and Manchu, a language with few remaining speakers. Our comparison with the zero-shot performance of GPT-4o and LLaMA 3.1 405B, highlights the significant challenges these models face when translating into low-resource languages. In contrast, our retrieval-based method shows promise in improving both word-level accuracy and overall semantic understanding by leveraging existing resources more effectively.</p></details> |  |

This approach often yields a low-quality fine-tuning training set (e.g., incorrect plans or intermediate reasoning). In this paper, we develop a reinforced self-training approach, called ReST-MCTS*, based on integrating process reward guidance with tree search MCTS* for collecting higher-quality reasoning traces as well as per-step value to train policy and reward models. ReST-MCTS* circumvents the per-step manual annotation typically used to train process rewards by tree-search-based reinforcement learning: Given oracle final correct answers, ReST-MCTS* is able to infer the correct process rewards by estimating the probability this step can help lead to the correct answer. These inferred rewards serve dual purposes: they act as value targets for further refining the process reward model and also facilitate the selection of high-quality traces for policy model self-training. We first show that the tree-search policy in ReST-MCTS* achieves higher accuracy compared with prior LLM reasoning baselines such as Best-of-N and Tree-of-Thought, within the same search budget. We then show that by using traces searched by this tree-search policy as training data, we can continuously enhance the three language models for multiple iterations, and outperform other self-training algorithms such as ReST$^\text{EM}$ and Self-Rewarding LM. We release all code at https://github.com/THUDM/ReST-MCTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

This study aims to understand how and why the integration of textual prompts into LLM can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of time series, which is not obvious at the glance, given the significant domain gap between texts and time series. Our extensive examination leads us to believe that (a) adding text prompts is roughly equivalent to introducing additional adapters, and (b) It is the introduction of learnable parameters rather than textual information that aligns the LLM with the time series forecasting task, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Inspired by this discovery, we developed four adapters that explicitly address the gap between LLM and time series, and further improve the prediction accuracy. Overall,our work highlights how textual prompts enhance LLM accuracy in time series forecasting and suggests new avenues for continually improving LLM-based time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

The process also slows down the model development and training process. In this study, we presented a novel method for deep learning-based instance segmentation of apples in commercial orchards that eliminates the need for labor-intensive field data collection and manual annotation. Utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM), we synthetically generated orchard images and automatically annotated them using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) integrated with a YOLO11 base model. This method significantly reduces reliance on physical sensors and manual data processing, presenting a major advancement in "Agricultural AI". The synthetic, auto-annotated dataset was used to train the YOLO11 model for Apple instance segmentation, which was then validated on real orchard images. The results showed that the automatically generated annotations achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.9513 and an IoU of 0.9303, validating the accuracy and overlap of the mask annotations. All YOLO11 configurations, trained solely on these synthetic datasets with automated annotations, accurately recognized and delineated apples, highlighting the method's efficacy. Specifically, the YOLO11m-seg configuration achieved a mask precision of 0.902 and a mask mAP@50 of 0.833 on test images collected from a commercial orchard. Additionally, the YOLO11l-seg configuration outperformed other models in validation on 40 LLM-generated images, achieving the highest mask precision and mAP@50 metrics.

These capabilities are further augmented during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase. Despite their potential, existing work mainly focuses on domain-specific enhancements during fine-tuning, the challenge of which lies in catastrophic forgetting of knowledge across other domains. In this study, we introduce VersaTune, a novel data composition framework designed for enhancing LLMs' overall multi-ability performances during fine-tuning. We categorize knowledge into distinct domains including law, medicine, finance, science, code. We begin with detecting the distribution of domain-specific knowledge within the base model, followed by the composition of training data that aligns with the model's existing knowledge distribution. During the fine-tuning process, weights of different domains are dynamically adjusted based on their learnable potential and forgetting degree. Experimental results demonstrate that VersaTune achieves significant improvements in multi-domain performance, with a 35.21% enhancement in comprehensive multi-domain tasks. Additionally, in scenarios where specific domain optimization is required, VersaTune reduces the degradation of performance in other domains by 38.77%, without compromising the target domain's training efficacy.</p></details> |  |

A key aspect of programming education is understanding and dealing with error message. However, 'logical errors' in which the program operates against the programmer's intentions do not receive error messages from the compiler. In this study, building on existing research on programming errors, we first define the types of logical errors that can occur in programming in general. Based on the definition, we propose an effective approach for detecting logical errors with LLMs that makes use of relations among error types in the Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought prompts. The experimental results indicate that when such logical error descriptions in the prompt are used, the average classifition performance is about 21% higher than the ones without them. We also conducted an experiment for exploiting the relations among errors in generating a new logical error dataset using LLMs. As there is very limited dataset for logical errors such benchmark dataset can be very useful for various programming related applications. We expect that our work can assist novice programmers in identifying the causes of code errors and correct them more effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ITS 2024 (Best Paper Award)</p></details> |

However, current MLLMs are surprisingly poor at understanding webpage screenshots and generating their corresponding HTML code. To address this problem, we propose $\texttt{Web2Code}$, a benchmark consisting of a new large-scale webpage-to-code dataset for instruction tuning and an evaluation framework for the webpage understanding and HTML code translation abilities of MLLMs. For dataset construction, we leverage pretrained LLMs to enhance existing webpage-to-code datasets as well as generate a diverse pool of new webpages rendered into images. Specifically, the inputs are webpage images and instructions, while the responses are the webpage's HTML code. We further include diverse natural language QA pairs about the webpage content in the responses to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the web content. To evaluate model performance in these tasks, we develop an evaluation framework for testing MLLMs' abilities in webpage understanding and web-to-code generation. Extensive experiments show that our proposed dataset is beneficial not only to our proposed tasks but also in the general visual domain.

Notably, in-context learning enables their use as evaluation metrics for natural language generation, making them particularly advantageous in low-resource scenarios and time-restricted applications. In this work, we introduce PrExMe, a large-scale Prompt Exploration for Metrics, where we evaluate more than 720 prompt templates for open-source LLM-based metrics on machine translation (MT) and summarization datasets, totalling over 6.6M evaluations. This extensive comparison (1) benchmarks recent open-source LLMs as metrics and (2) explores the stability and variability of different prompting strategies. We discover that, on the one hand, there are scenarios for which prompts are stable. For instance, some LLMs show idiosyncratic preferences and favor to grade generated texts with textual labels while others prefer to return numeric scores. On the other hand, the stability of prompts and model rankings can be susceptible to seemingly innocuous changes. For example, changing the requested output format from "0 to 100" to "-1 to +1" can strongly affect the rankings in our evaluation. Our study contributes to understanding the impact of different prompting approaches on LLM-based metrics for MT and summarization evaluation, highlighting the most stable prompting patterns and potential limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 main; camera-ready</p></details> |

Recent research suggests using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the annotation process, reducing these costs while maintaining data quality. LLMs have shown promising results in annotating downstream tasks like hate speech detection and political framing. Building on the success in these areas, this study investigates whether LLMs are viable for annotating the complex task of media bias detection and whether a downstream media bias classifier can be trained on such data. We create annolexical, the first large-scale dataset for media bias classification with over 48000 synthetically annotated examples. Our classifier, fine-tuned on this dataset, surpasses all of the annotator LLMs by 5-9 percent in Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and performs close to or outperforms the model trained on human-labeled data when evaluated on two media bias benchmark datasets (BABE and BASIL). This study demonstrates how our approach significantly reduces the cost of dataset creation in the media bias domain and, by extension, the development of classifiers, while our subsequent behavioral stress-testing reveals some of its current limitations and trade-offs.</p></details> |  |

Specialized applications for analytics-heavy domains such as Financial report generation require specific writing styles that comprise compound and creative sentences with minimized hallucinations. In this work, we explore the self-corrective auto-regressive qualities of LLMs to learn creativity in writing styles with minimal prompting. We propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning (FT) strategy wherein in the first stage public domain financial reports are used to train for writing styles while allowing the LLM to hallucinate. In the second stage the examples of hallucinations are manually corrected and further used to fine-tune the LLM. The finally trained LLM learns to generate specific financial report sections using minimal instructions and tabular data inputs while ensuring low fine-tuning costs. Our proposed two-stage fine-tuning boosts the accuracy of financial questions answering by two-folds while reducing hallucinations by over 50%. Also, the fine-tuned model has lower perplexity, improved ROUGE, TER and BLEU scores, higher creativity and knowledge density with lower uncertainty and cross entropy than base LLMs. Thus, the proposed framework can be generalized to train creativity in LLMs by first allowing them to hallucinate.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables, conference</p></details> |

In this paper, we address these gaps through a comprehensive toxicity evaluation of LLMs across diverse dialects. We create a multi-dialect dataset through synthetic transformations and human-assisted translations, covering 10 language clusters and 60 varieties. We then evaluated three LLMs on their ability to assess toxicity across multilingual, dialectal, and LLM-human consistency. Our findings show that LLMs are sensitive in handling both multilingual and dialectal variations. However, if we have to rank the consistency, the weakest area is LLM-human agreement, followed by dialectal consistency.

While recent studies have yielded valuable insights into the mechanisms of textual LLMs, the mechanisms of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remain underexplored. In this paper, we apply mechanistic interpretability methods to analyze the visual question answering (VQA) mechanisms in the first MLLM, Llava. We compare the mechanisms between VQA and textual QA (TQA) in color answering tasks and find that: a) VQA exhibits a mechanism similar to the in-context learning mechanism observed in TQA; b) the visual features exhibit significant interpretability when projecting the visual embeddings into the embedding space; and c) Llava enhances the existing capabilities of the corresponding textual LLM Vicuna during visual instruction tuning. Based on these findings, we develop an interpretability tool to help users and researchers identify important visual locations for final predictions, aiding in the understanding of visual hallucination. Our method demonstrates faster and more effective results compared to existing interpretability approaches. Code: \url{https://github.com/zepingyu0512/llava-mechanism}</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Memory-Augmented Multimodal LLMs for Surgical VQA via Self-Contained Inquiry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10937v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comprehensively understanding surgical scenes in Surgical Visual Question Answering (Surgical VQA) requires reasoning over multiple objects. Previous approaches address this task using cross-modal fusion strategies to enhance reasoning ability. However, these methods often struggle with limited scene understanding and question comprehension, and some rely on external resources (e.g., pre-extracted object features), which can introduce errors and generalize poorly across diverse surgical environments. To address these challenges, we propose SCAN, a simple yet effective memory-augmented framework that leverages Multimodal LLMs to improve surgical context comprehension via Self-Contained Inquiry. SCAN operates autonomously, generating two types of memory for context augmentation: Direct Memory (DM), which provides multiple candidates (or hints) to the final answer, and Indirect Memory (IM), which consists of self-contained question-hint pairs to capture broader scene context. DM directly assists in answering the question, while IM enhances understanding of the surgical scene beyond the immediate query. Reasoning over these object-aware memories enables the model to accurately interpret images and respond to questions. Extensive experiments on three publicly available Surgical VQA datasets demonstrate that SCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering improved accuracy and robustness across various surgical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We cluster these embeddings automatically using affinity propagation and further narrow this clustering down through manual analysis. We analyze the chat of one stream by each Twitch streamer: SmallAnt, DougDoug and PointCrow. Our findings suggest that each streamer has their own type of chatters, however two categories emerge for all of the streamers: supportive viewers and emoji and reaction senders. Repetitive message spammers is a shared chatter category for two of the streamers.</p></details> | NLP4DH 2024 |

These techniques reduce bottlenecks associated with memory bandwidth, but also increase end-to-end latency per inference run, requiring high speculation acceptance rates to improve performance. Combined with a variable rate of acceptance across tasks, speculative inference techniques can result in reduced performance. Additionally, pipeline-parallel designs require many user requests to maintain maximum utilization. As a remedy, we propose PipeInfer, a pipelined speculative acceleration technique to reduce inter-token latency and improve system utilization for single-request scenarios while also improving tolerance to low speculation acceptance rates and low-bandwidth interconnects. PipeInfer exhibits up to a 2.15$\times$ improvement in generation speed over standard speculative inference. PipeInfer achieves its improvement through Continuous Asynchronous Speculation and Early Inference Cancellation, the former improving latency and generation speed by running single-token inference simultaneously with several speculative runs, while the latter improves speed and latency by skipping the computation of invalidated runs, even in the middle of inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, submitted to SC24 conference</p></details> |

The study utilizes their logical reasoning, scene understanding, and decision-making capabilities to optimize throughput and provide feedback based on traffic conditions in real-time. LLMs centralize traditionally disconnected traffic control processes and can integrate traffic data from diverse sources to provide context-aware decisions. LLMs can also deliver tailored outputs using various means such as wireless signals and visuals to drivers, infrastructures, and autonomous vehicles. To evaluate LLMs ability as traffic controllers, this study proposed a four-stage methodology. The methodology includes data creation and environment initialization, prompt engineering, conflict identification, and fine-tuning. We simulated multi-lane four-leg intersection scenarios and generates detailed datasets to enable conflict detection using LLMs and Python simulation as a ground truth. We used chain-of-thought prompts to lead LLMs in understanding the context, detecting conflicts, resolving them using traffic rules, and delivering context-sensitive traffic management solutions. We evaluated the prformance GPT-mini, Gemini, and Llama as traffic controllers. Results showed that the fine-tuned GPT-mini achieved 83% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.84. GPT-mini model exhibited a promising performance in generating actionable traffic management insights, with high ROUGE-L scores across conflict identification of 0.95, decision-making of 0.91, priority assignment of 0.94, and waiting time optimization of 0.92. We demonstrated that LLMs can offer precise recommendations to drivers in real-time including yielding, slowing, or stopping based on vehicle dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The data and code that support the findings of this study are openly available in Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14171745, reference number 14171745</p></details> |

Unveiling the vulnerabilities of safety guardrails to harmful queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15302v5)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we tackle a growing concern around the safety and ethical use of large language models (LLMs). Despite their potential, these models can be tricked into producing harmful or unethical content through various sophisticated methods, including 'jailbreaking' techniques and targeted manipulation. Our work zeroes in on a specific issue: to what extent LLMs can be led astray by asking them to generate responses that are instruction-centric such as a pseudocode, a program or a software snippet as opposed to vanilla text. To investigate this question, we introduce TechHazardQA, a dataset containing complex queries which should be answered in both text and instruction-centric formats (e.g., pseudocodes), aimed at identifying triggers for unethical responses. We query a series of LLMs -- Llama-2-13b, Llama-2-7b, Mistral-V2 and Mistral 8X7B -- and ask them to generate both text and instruction-centric responses. For evaluation we report the harmfulness score metric as well as judgements from GPT-4 and humans. Overall, we observe that asking LLMs to produce instruction-centric responses enhances the unethical response generation by ~2-38% across the models. As an additional objective, we investigate the impact of model editing using the ROME technique, which further increases the propensity for generating undesirable content. In particular, asking edited LLMs to generate instruction-centric responses further increases the unethical response generation by ~3-16% across the different models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) 2025.

In this work, we explore LLM evaluation challenges for low-resource language understanding and introduce ProverbEval, LLM evaluation benchmark for low-resource languages based on proverbs to focus on low-resource language understanding in culture-specific scenarios. We benchmark various LLMs and explore factors that create variability in the benchmarking process. We observed performance variances of up to 50%, depending on the order in which answer choices were presented in multiple-choice tasks. Native language proverb descriptions significantly improve tasks such as proverb generation, contributing to improved outcomes. Additionally, monolingual evaluations consistently outperformed their cross-lingual counterparts. We argue special attention must be given to the order of choices, choice of prompt language, task variability, and generation tasks when creating LLM evaluation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Invar-RAG: Invariant LLM-aligned Retrieval for Better Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07021v2)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capability in providing reliable answer predictions and addressing hallucination problems. A typical RAG implementation uses powerful retrieval models to extract external information and large language models (LLMs) to generate answers. In contrast, recent LLM-based retrieval has gained attention for its substantial improvements in information retrieval (IR) due to the LLMs' semantic understanding capability. However, directly applying LLM to RAG systems presents challenges. This may cause feature locality problems as massive parametric knowledge can hinder effective usage of global information across the corpus; for example, an LLM-based retriever often inputs document summaries instead of full documents. Moreover, various pre-trained tasks in LLMs introduce variance, further weakening performance as a retriever. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning architecture called Invar-RAG. In the retrieval stage, an LLM-based retriever is constructed by integrating LoRA-based representation learning to tackle feature locality issues. To enhance retrieval performance, we develop two patterns (invariant and variant patterns) and an invariance loss to reduce LLM variance. In the generation stage, a refined fine-tuning method is employed to improve LLM accuracy in generating answers based on retrieved information. Experimental results show that Invar-RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines across three open-domain question answering (ODQA) datasets. Code is available in the Supplementary Material for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance in the domain of child-inclusive interactions, including in clinical settings, remains less explored. In this work, we evaluate generic LLMs' ability to analyze child-adult dyadic interactions in a clinically relevant context involving children with ASD. Specifically, we explore LLMs in performing four tasks: classifying child-adult utterances, predicting engaged activities, recognizing language skills and understanding traits that are clinically relevant. Our evaluation shows that generic LLMs are highly capable of analyzing long and complex conversations in clinical observation sessions, often surpassing the performance of non-expert human evaluators. The results show their potential to segment interactions of interest, assist in language skills evaluation, identify engaged activities, and offer clinical-relevant context for assessments.</p></details> | <details><summary>GenAI...</summary><p>GenAI for Health Workshop, NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. Causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results advise caution when using LLMs to study human behavior or as surrogates or simulations.</p></details> |  |

As LLMs become integral to various applications, they also present potential attack surfaces, exposed to security risks such as information leakage and jailbreak attacks. Our study evaluates prominent scanners - Garak, Giskard, PyRIT, and CyberSecEval - that adapt red-teaming practices to expose these vulnerabilities. We detail the distinctive features and practical use of these scanners, outline unifying principles of their design and perform quantitative evaluations to compare them. These evaluations uncover significant reliability issues in detecting successful attacks, highlighting a fundamental gap for future development. Additionally, we contribute a preliminary labelled dataset, which serves as an initial step to bridge this gap. Based on the above, we provide strategic recommendations to assist organizations choose the most suitable scanner for their red-teaming needs, accounting for customizability, test suite comprehensiveness, and industry-specific use cases.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Recent work, MeZO, addresses this issue using a zeroth-order (ZO) optimization method, which reduces memory consumption by matching the usage to the inference phase. However, MeZO experiences slow convergence due to varying curvatures across model parameters. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HELENE, a novel scalable and memory-efficient optimizer that integrates annealed A-GNB gradients with a diagonal Hessian estimation and layer-wise clipping, serving as a second-order pre-conditioner. This combination allows for faster and more stable convergence. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that HELENE improves convergence rates, particularly for models with heterogeneous layer dimensions, by reducing the dependency on the total parameter space dimension. Instead, the method scales with the largest layer dimension, making it highly suitable for modern LLM architectures. Experimental results on RoBERTa-large and OPT-1.3B across multiple tasks show that HELENE achieves up to a 20x speedup compared to MeZO, with average accuracy improvements of 1.5%. Furthermore, HELENE remains compatible with both full parameter tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), outperforming several state-of-the-art optimizers. The codes will be released after reviewing.</p></details> |  |

However, the rapid proliferation of LLMs (with over 560 companies developing or deploying them as of 2024) has raised concerns about their originality and trustworthiness. A notable issue, termed identity confusion, has emerged, where LLMs misrepresent their origins or identities. This study systematically examines identity confusion through three research questions: (1) How prevalent is identity confusion among LLMs? (2) Does it arise from model reuse, plagiarism, or hallucination? (3) What are the security and trust-related impacts of identity confusion? To address these, we developed an automated tool combining documentation analysis, self-identity recognition testing, and output similarity comparisons--established methods for LLM fingerprinting--and conducted a structured survey via Credamo to assess its impact on user trust. Our analysis of 27 LLMs revealed that 25.93% exhibit identity confusion. Output similarity analysis confirmed that these issues stem from hallucinations rather than replication or reuse. Survey results further highlighted that identity confusion significantly erodes trust, particularly in critical tasks like education and professional use, with declines exceeding those caused by logical errors or inconsistencies. Users attributed these failures to design flaws, incorrect training data, and perceived plagiarism, underscoring the systemic risks posed by identity confusion to LLM reliability and trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figure, 6 tables</p></details> |

SuDoSys leverages the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Problem Management Plus (PM+) guidelines to deliver stage-aware multi-turn dialogues. Existing methods for employing an LLM in multi-turn psychological counseling typically involve direct fine-tuning using generated dialogues, often neglecting the dynamic stage shifts of counseling sessions. Unlike previous approaches, SuDoSys considers the different stages of counseling and stores essential information throughout the counseling process, ensuring coherent and directed conversations. The system employs an LLM, a stage-aware instruction generator, a response unpacker, a topic database, and a stage controller to maintain dialogue flow. In addition, we propose a novel technique that simulates counseling clients to interact with the evaluated system and evaluate its performance automatically. When assessed using both objective and subjective evaluations, SuDoSys demonstrates its effectiveness in generating logically coherent responses.

With the increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) in human-facing artificial intelligence (AI) applications, detecting these types of biases is essential. However, LLMs risk perpetuating and amplifying stereotypical outputs derived from their training data. A reliable stereotype detector is crucial for benchmarking bias, monitoring model input and output, filtering training data, and ensuring fairer model behavior in downstream applications. This paper introduces the Multi-Grain Stereotype (MGS) dataset, consisting of 51,867 instances across gender, race, profession, religion, and other stereotypes, curated from multiple existing datasets. We evaluate various machine learning approaches to establish baselines and fine-tune language models of different architectures and sizes, presenting a suite of stereotype multiclass classifiers trained on the MGS dataset. Given the subjectivity of stereotypes, explainability is essential to align model learning with human understanding of stereotypes. We employ explainable AI (XAI) tools, including SHAP, LIME, and BertViz, to assess whether the model's learned patterns align with human intuitions about stereotypes.Additionally, we develop stereotype elicitation prompts and benchmark the presence of stereotypes in text generation tasks using popular LLMs, employing the best-performing stereotype classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review as a conference paper at ARR October 2024</p></details> |

Therefore the energy consumption of code must be minimized. Code can be generated by large language models. We look at the influence of prompt modification on the energy consumption of the code generated. We use three different Python code problems of varying difficulty levels. Prompt modification is done by adding the sentence ``Give me an energy-optimized solution for this problem'' or by using two Python coding best practices. The large language models used are CodeLlama-70b, CodeLlama-70b-Instruct, CodeLlama-70b-Python, DeepSeek-Coder-33b-base, and DeepSeek-Coder-33b-instruct. We find a decrease in energy consumption for a specific combination of prompt optimization, LLM, and Python code problem. However, no single optimization prompt consistently decreases energy consumption for the same LLM across the different Python code problems.</p></details> |  |

Nowadays, LLMs such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are extensively used in code generation for enterprise and open-source software development and maintenance. Despite their unprecedented successes in code generation, research indicates that codes generated by LLMs exhibit vulnerabilities and security issues. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate code generated by LLMs, considering various aspects such as security, vulnerability, code smells, and robustness. While some studies have compared the performance of LLMs with that of humans in various software engineering tasks, there's a notable gap in research: no studies have directly compared human-written and LLM-generated code for their robustness analysis. To fill this void, this paper introduces an empirical study to evaluate the adversarial robustness of Pre-trained Models of Code (PTMCs) fine-tuned on code written by humans and generated by LLMs against adversarial attacks for software clone detection. These attacks could potentially undermine software security and reliability. We consider two datasets, two state-of-the-art PTMCs, two robustness evaluation criteria, and three metrics to use in our experiments. Regarding effectiveness criteria, PTMCs fine-tuned on human-written code always demonstrate more robustness than those fine-tuned on LLMs-generated code. On the other hand, in terms of adversarial code quality, in 75% experimental combinations, PTMCs fine-tuned on the human-written code exhibit more robustness than the PTMCs fine-tuned on the LLMs-generated code.</p></details> |  |

Although previous research has explored aspects like rephrasing prompt contexts, using various prompting techniques (like in-context learning and chain-of-thought), and ordering few-shot examples, our understanding of LLM sensitivity to prompt templates remains limited. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of different prompt templates on LLM performance. We formatted the same contexts into various human-readable templates, including plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML, and evaluated their impact across tasks like natural language reasoning, code generation, and translation using OpenAI's GPT models. Experiments show that GPT-3.5-turbo's performance varies by up to 40\% in a code translation task depending on the prompt template, while larger models like GPT-4 are more robust to these variations. Our analysis highlights the need to reconsider the use of fixed prompt templates, as different formats can significantly affect model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

However, a notable research gap exists in the evaluation of social biases that may be present in the code produced by LLMs. To solve this issue, we propose a novel fairness framework, i.e., Solar, to assess and mitigate the social biases of LLM-generated code. Specifically, Solar can automatically generate test cases for quantitatively uncovering social biases of the auto-generated code by LLMs. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset that covers a diverse set of social problems. We applied Solar and the crafted dataset to four state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation. Our evaluation reveals severe bias in the LLM-generated code from all the subject LLMs. Furthermore, we explore several strategies for bias mitigation, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, combining positive role-playing with CoT prompting and iterative prompting. Our experiments show that iterative prompting can effectively reduce social bias in LLM-generated code by up to 90%. Solar is highly extensible to evaluate new social problems.</p></details> | 9pages, 3 figures |

Recently, various new methods have been proposed to adapt closed LLMs to private data without leaking private information to third parties and/or the LLM provider. In this work, we analyze the privacy protection and performance of the four most recent methods for private adaptation of closed LLMs. By examining their threat models and thoroughly comparing their performance under different privacy levels according to differential privacy (DP), various LLM architectures, and multiple datasets for classification and generation tasks, we find that: (1) all the methods leak query data, i.e., the (potentially sensitive) user data that is queried at inference time, to the LLM provider, (2) three out of four methods also leak large fractions of private training data to the LLM provider while the method that protects private data requires a local open LLM, (3) all the methods exhibit lower performance compared to three private gradient-based adaptation methods for local open LLMs, and (4) the private adaptation methods for closed LLMs incur higher monetary training and query costs than running the alternative methods on local open LLMs. This yields the conclusion that, to achieve truly privacy-preserving LLM adaptations that yield high performance and more privacy at lower costs, taking into account current methods and models, one should use open LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

LLM-as-a-Judge has many applications such as LLM-powered search, reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), and tool selection. In this work, we propose JudgeDeceiver, an optimization-based prompt injection attack to LLM-as-a-Judge. JudgeDeceiver injects a carefully crafted sequence into an attacker-controlled candidate response such that LLM-as-a-Judge selects the candidate response for an attacker-chosen question no matter what other candidate responses are. Specifically, we formulate finding such sequence as an optimization problem and propose a gradient based method to approximately solve it. Our extensive evaluation shows that JudgeDeceive is highly effective, and is much more effective than existing prompt injection attacks that manually craft the injected sequences and jailbreak attacks when extended to our problem. We also show the effectiveness of JudgeDeceiver in three case studies, i.e., LLM-powered search, RLAIF, and tool selection. Moreover, we consider defenses including known-answer detection, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection. Our results show these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies.

However, systematic analysis of these agent and non-agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine seven proprietary and open-source systems on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting instances solvable by all or none of these sytems, and explore why some instances are uniquely solved by specific system types. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and line levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities, identifying instances solvable only through dynamic reproduction. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic LLMs in the Supply Chain: Towards Autonomous Multi-Agent Consensus-Seeking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10184v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate consensus-seeking in supply chain management (SCM), where frequent decisions on problems such as inventory levels and delivery times require coordination among companies. Traditional SCM relies on human consensus in decision-making to avoid emergent problems like the bullwhip effect. Some routine consensus processes, especially those that are time-intensive and costly, can be automated. Existing solutions for automated coordination have faced challenges due to high entry barriers locking out SMEs, limited capabilities, and limited adaptability in complex scenarios. However, recent advances in Generative AI, particularly LLMs, show promise in overcoming these barriers. LLMs, trained on vast datasets can negotiate, reason, and plan, facilitating near-human-level consensus at scale with minimal entry barriers. In this work, we identify key limitations in existing approaches and propose autonomous LLM agents to address these gaps. We introduce a series of novel, supply chain-specific consensus-seeking frameworks tailored for LLM agents and validate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study in inventory management.

| **[Compound-QA: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Compound Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10163v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across various tasks, prompting researchers to develop diverse evaluation benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks typically measure the ability of LLMs to respond to individual questions, neglecting the complex interactions in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce Compound Question Synthesis (CQ-Syn) to create the Compound-QA benchmark, focusing on compound questions with multiple sub-questions. This benchmark is derived from existing QA datasets, annotated with proprietary LLMs and verified by humans for accuracy. It encompasses five categories: Factual-Statement, Cause-and-Effect, Hypothetical-Analysis, Comparison-and-Selection, and Evaluation-and-Suggestion. It evaluates the LLM capability in terms of three dimensions including understanding, reasoning, and knowledge. Our assessment of eight open-source LLMs using Compound-QA reveals distinct patterns in their responses to compound questions, which are significantly poorer than those to non-compound questions. Additionally, we investigate various methods to enhance LLMs performance on compound questions. The results indicate that these approaches significantly improve the models' comprehension and reasoning abilities on compound questions.</p></details> |  |

For faster inference latency, LLMs are deployed on multiple hardware accelerators through various Model Parallelism strategies. Our paper looks into the details on one such strategy - Tensor Parallel - and proposes to reduce latency by compressing inter-accelerator communication. We leverage fine grained quantization techniques to compress selected activations by 3.5 - 4.5x. Our proposed method leads up to 2x reduction of time-to-first-token (TTFT) with negligible model performance degradation.</p></details> |  |

Using the important Western Han dynasty text "Yantie Lun" as a case study, we demonstrate the framework's potential applications in historical research and education. HistoLens integrates NLP technology (especially LLMs), including named entity recognition, knowledge graph construction, and geographic information visualization. The paper showcases how HistoLens explores Western Han culture in "Yantie Lun" through multi-dimensional, visual, and quantitative methods, focusing particularly on the influence of Confucian and Legalist thoughts on political, economic, military, and ethnic. We also demonstrate how HistoLens constructs a machine teaching scenario using LLMs for explainable analysis, based on a dataset of Confucian and Legalist ideas extracted with LLM assistance. This approach offers novel and diverse perspectives for studying historical texts like "Yantie Lun" and provides new auxiliary tools for history education. The framework aims to equip historians and learners with LLM-assisted tools to facilitate in-depth, multi-layered analysis of historical texts and foster innovation in historical education.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches are constrained by using a fixed number of agents and static communication structures. In this work, we propose automatically selecting a team of agents from candidates to collaborate in a dynamic communication structure toward different tasks and domains. Specifically, we build a framework named Dynamic LLM-Powered Agent Network ($\textbf{DyLAN}$) for LLM-powered agent collaboration, operating a two-stage paradigm: (1) Team Optimization and (2) Task Solving. During the first stage, we utilize an $\textit{agent selection}$ algorithm, based on an unsupervised metric called $\textit{Agent Importance Score}$, enabling the selection of best agents according to their contributions in a preliminary trial, oriented to the given task. Then, in the second stage, the selected agents collaborate dynamically according to the query. Empirically, we demonstrate that DyLAN outperforms strong baselines in code generation, decision-making, general reasoning, and arithmetic reasoning tasks with moderate computational cost. On specific subjects in MMLU, selecting a team of agents in the team optimization stage improves accuracy by up to 25.0% in DyLAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in COLM2024.

An Empirical Study on LLM Failures in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09916v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software engineers are integrating AI assistants into their workflows to enhance productivity and reduce cognitive strain. However, experiences vary significantly, with some engineers finding large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, beneficial, while others consider them counterproductive. Researchers also found that ChatGPT's answers included incorrect information. Given the fact that LLMs are still imperfect, it is important to understand how to best incorporate LLMs into the workflow for software engineering (SE) task completion. Therefore, we conducted an observational study with 22 participants using ChatGPT as a coding assistant in a non-trivial SE task to understand the practices, challenges, and opportunities for using LLMs for SE tasks. We identified the cases where ChatGPT failed, their root causes, and the corresponding mitigation solutions used by users. These findings contribute to the overall understanding and strategies for human-AI interaction on SE tasks. Our study also highlights future research and tooling support directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMXFP4: Taming Activation Outliers with Asymmetric Microscaling Floating-Point for 4-bit LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09909v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths has increased the need for efficient low-bit quantization to manage their substantial computational demands. However, reducing precision to 4 bits frequently degrades performance due to activation outliers. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Microscaling 4-bit Floating-Point (AMXFP4) for efficient LLM inference. This novel data format leverages asymmetric shared scales to mitigate outliers while naturally capturing the asymmetry introduced by group-wise quantization. Unlike conventional 4-bit quantization methods that rely on data rotation and costly calibration, AMXFP4 uses asymmetric shared scales for direct 4-bit casting, achieving near-ideal quantization accuracy across various LLM tasks, including multi-turn conversations, long-context reasoning, and visual question answering. Our AMXFP4 format significantly outperforms MXFP4 and other leading quantization techniques, enabling robust, calibration-free 4-bit inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-assisted Explicit and Implicit Multi-interest Learning Framework for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09410v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-interest modeling in current recommender systems (RS) is mainly based on user behavioral data, capturing user interest preferences from multiple dimensions. However, since behavioral data is implicit and often highly sparse, it is challenging to understand users' complex and diverse interests. Recent studies have shown that the rich semantic information in the text can effectively supplement the deficiencies of behavioral data. Despite this, it is still difficult for small models to directly extract semantic features associated with users' deep interests. That is, how to effectively align semantics with behavioral information to form a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of user interests has become a critical research problem. To address this, we propose an LLM-assisted explicit and implicit multi-interest learning framework (named EIMF) to model user interests on two levels: behavior and semantics. The framework consists of two parts: Implicit Behavioral Interest Module (IBIM) and Explicit Semantic Interest Module (ESIM). The traditional multi-interest RS model in IBIM can learn users' implicit behavioral interests from interactions with items. In ESIM, we first adopt a clustering algorithm to select typical samples and design a prompting strategy on LLM to obtain explicit semantic interests. Furthermore, in the training phase, the semantic interests of typical samples can enhance the representation learning of behavioral interests based on the multi-task learning on semantic prediction and modality alignment. Therefore, in the inference stage, accurate recommendations can be achieved with only the user's behavioral data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EIMF framework, which effectively and efficiently combines small models with LLM to improve the accuracy of multi-interest modeling.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Automated Clinical Data Extraction with Knowledge Conditioned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18027v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extraction of lung lesion information from clinical and medical imaging reports is crucial for research on and clinical care of lung-related diseases. Large language models (LLMs) can be effective at interpreting unstructured text in reports, but they often hallucinate due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, leading to reduced accuracy and posing challenges for use in clinical settings. To address this, we propose a novel framework that aligns generated internal knowledge with external knowledge through in-context learning (ICL). Our framework employs a retriever to identify relevant units of internal or external knowledge and a grader to evaluate the truthfulness and helpfulness of the retrieved internal-knowledge rules, to align and update the knowledge bases. Experiments with expert-curated test datasets demonstrate that this ICL approach can increase the F1 score for key fields (lesion size, margin and solidity) by an average of 12.9% over existing ICL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLIN...</summary><p>COLING25 Industry Track</p></details> |

As large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities to incorporate personas to AI-based tutors and support dynamic interactive dialogue, this paper explores how DHH learners perceive LLM-powered ITS with different personas and identified design suggestions for improving the interaction. We developed an interface that allows DHH learners to interact with ChatGPT and three LLM-powered AI tutors with different experiences in DHH education while the learners watch an educational video. A user study with 16 DHH participants showed that they perceived conversations with the AI tutors who had DHH education experiences to be more human-like and trustworthy due to the tutors' cultural knowledge of DHH communities. Participants also suggested providing more transparency regarding the tutors' background information to clarify each AI tutor's position within the DHH community. We discuss design implications for more inclusive LLM-based systems, such as supports for the multimodality of sign language.</p></details> |  |

Most existing detection methods rely on external knowledge, LLM fine-tuning, or hallucination-labeled datasets, and they do not distinguish between different types of hallucinations, which are crucial for improving detection performance. We introduce a new task, Hallucination Reasoning, which classifies LLM-generated text into one of three categories: aligned, misaligned, and fabricated. Our novel zero-shot method assesses whether LLM has enough knowledge about a given prompt and text. Our experiments conducted on new datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in hallucination reasoning and underscore its importance for enhancing detection performance.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose AutoDefense, a multi-agent defense framework that filters harmful responses from LLMs. With the response-filtering mechanism, our framework is robust against different jailbreak attack prompts, and can be used to defend different victim models. AutoDefense assigns different roles to LLM agents and employs them to complete the defense task collaboratively. The division in tasks enhances the overall instruction-following of LLMs and enables the integration of other defense components as tools. With AutoDefense, small open-source LMs can serve as agents and defend larger models against jailbreak attacks. Our experiments show that AutoDefense can effectively defense against different jailbreak attacks, while maintaining the performance at normal user request. For example, we reduce the attack success rate on GPT-3.5 from 55.74% to 7.95% using LLaMA-2-13b with a 3-agent system. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/XHMY/AutoDefense.</p></details> |  |

However, Any-to-Any MLLMs are limited to generating pairwise modalities 'Text + X' within a single response, such as Text + {Image or Audio or Video}. To address this limitation, we introduce Spider, a novel efficient Any-to-Many Modalities Generation (AMMG) framework, which can generate an arbitrary combination of modalities 'Text + Xs', such as Text + {Image and Audio and Video}. To achieve efficient AMMG, our Spider integrates three core components: a Base Model for basic X-to-X (i.e., Any-to-Any) modality processing, a novel Efficient Decoders-Controller for controlling multimodal Decoders to generate Xs (many-modal) contents, and an Any-to-Many Instruction Template designed for producing Xs signal prompts. To train Spider, we constructed a novel Text-formatted Many-Modal (TMM) dataset, which facilitates the learning of the X-to-Xs (i.e., Any-to-Many) capability necessary for AMMG. Ultimately, the well-trained Spider generates a pseudo X-to-Xs dataset, the first-ever X-to-Xs many-modal dataset, enhancing the potential for AMMG task in future research. Overall, this work not only pushes the boundary of multimodal interaction but also provides rich data support for advancing the field.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs have achieved success in various tasks, they face numerous security and privacy threats, which become even more severe in the agent scenarios. To enhance the reliability of LLM-based applications, a range of research has emerged to assess and mitigate these risks from different perspectives. To help researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of various risks, this survey collects and analyzes the different threats faced by these agents. To address the challenges posed by previous taxonomies in handling cross-module and cross-stage threats, we propose a novel taxonomy framework based on the sources and impacts. Additionally, we identify six key features of LLM-based agents, based on which we summarize the current research progress and analyze their limitations. Subsequently, we select four representative agents as case studies to analyze the risks they may face in practical use. Finally, based on the aforementioned analyses, we propose future research directions from the perspectives of data, methodology, and policy, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses these challenges by categorizing capabilities into language abilities (syntax and semantics) and cognitive abilities (knowledge and reasoning). To systematically evaluate these areas, we developed MM-Eval, a specialized dataset based on Modern Mongolian Language Textbook I and enriched with WebQSP and MGSM datasets. Preliminary experiments on models including Qwen2-7B-Instruct, GLM4-9b-chat, Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, GPT-4, and DeepseekV2.5 revealed that: 1) all models performed better on syntactic tasks than semantic tasks, highlighting a gap in deeper language understanding; and 2) knowledge tasks showed a moderate decline, suggesting that models can transfer general knowledge from high-resource to low-resource contexts. The release of MM-Eval, comprising 569 syntax, 677 semantics, 344 knowledge, and 250 reasoning tasks, offers valuable insights for advancing NLP and LLMs in low-resource languages like Mongolian. The dataset is available at https://github.com/joenahm/MM-Eval.</p></details> |  |

A Structured Investigation Framework and Toxicity Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06900v5)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the pursuit of developing Large Language Models (LLMs) that adhere to societal standards, it is imperative to detect the toxicity in the generated text. The majority of existing toxicity metrics rely on encoder models trained on specific toxicity datasets, which are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems and depend on the dataset's definition of toxicity. In this paper, we introduce a robust metric grounded on LLMs to flexibly measure toxicity according to the given definition. We first analyze the toxicity factors, followed by an examination of the intrinsic toxic attributes of LLMs to ascertain their suitability as evaluators. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our metric with detailed analysis. Our empirical results demonstrate outstanding performance in measuring toxicity within verified factors, improving on conventional metrics by 12 points in the F1 score. Our findings also indicate that upstream toxicity significantly influences downstream metrics, suggesting that LLMs are unsuitable for toxicity evaluations within unverified factors.</p></details> | 8 page long |

While there are numerous opportunities to use LLMs for supporting research or software engineering tasks, solid science needs rigorous empirical evaluations. However, so far, there are no specific guidelines for conducting and assessing studies involving LLMs in software engineering research. Our focus is on empirical studies that either use LLMs as part of the research process (e.g., for data annotation) or studies that evaluate existing or new tools that are based on LLMs. This paper contributes the first set of guidelines for such studies. Our goal is to start a discussion in the software engineering research community to reach a common understanding of what our community standards are for high-quality empirical studies involving LLMs.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Recent studies disclose knowledge conflicts in LLM generation, wherein outdated or incorrect parametric knowledge (i.e., encoded knowledge) contradicts new knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate such knowledge conflicts, we propose a novel framework, IRCAN (Identifying and Reweighting Context-Aware Neurons) to capitalize on neurons that are crucial in processing contextual cues. Specifically, IRCAN first identifies neurons that significantly contribute to context processing, utilizing a context-aware attribution score derived from integrated gradients. Subsequently, the identified context-aware neurons are strengthened via reweighting. In doing so, we steer LLMs to generate context-sensitive outputs with respect to the new knowledge provided in the context. Extensive experiments conducted across a variety of models and tasks demonstrate that IRCAN not only achieves remarkable improvements in handling knowledge conflicts but also offers a scalable, plug-and-play solution that can be integrated seamlessly with existing models. Our codes are released at https://github.com/danshi777/IRCAN.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

A common solution is to spill over to CPU memory; however, traditional GPU-CPU memory swapping often results in higher latency and lower throughput. This paper introduces Pie, an LLM inference framework that addresses these challenges with performance-transparent swapping and adaptive expansion. By leveraging predictable memory access patterns and the high bandwidth of modern hardware like the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, Pie enables concurrent data swapping without affecting foreground computation, expanding effective memory without added latency. Adaptive expansion dynamically adjusts CPU memory allocation based on real-time information, optimizing memory usage and performance under varying conditions. Pie maintains low computation latency, high throughput, and high elasticity. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Pie achieves optimal swapping policy during cache warmup and effectively balances increased memory capacity with negligible impact on computation. With its extended capacity, Pie outperforms vLLM by up to 1.9X in throughput and 2X in latency. Additionally, Pie can reduce GPU memory usage by up to 1.67X while maintaining the same performance. Compared to FlexGen, an offline profiling-based swapping solution, Pie achieves magnitudes lower latency and 9.4X higher throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing multiple LLMs for Information Retrieval: A case study on Deep Learning methodologies in Biodiversity publications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09269v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) techniques are increasingly applied in scientific studies across various domains to address complex research questions. However, the methodological details of these DL models are often hidden in the unstructured text. As a result, critical information about how these models are designed, trained, and evaluated is challenging to access and comprehend. To address this issue, in this work, we use five different open-source Large Language Models (LLMs): Llama-3 70B, Llama-3.1 70B, Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1, Mixtral 8x7B, and Gemma 2 9B in combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to extract and process DL methodological details from scientific publications automatically. We built a voting classifier from the outputs of five LLMs to accurately report DL methodological information. We tested our approach using biodiversity publications, building upon our previous research. To validate our pipeline, we employed two datasets of DL-related biodiversity publications: a curated set of 100 publications from our prior work and a set of 364 publications from the Ecological Informatics journal. Our results demonstrate that the multi-LLM, RAG-assisted pipeline enhances the retrieval of DL methodological information, achieving an accuracy of 69.5% (417 out of 600 comparisons) based solely on textual content from publications. This performance was assessed against human annotators who had access to code, figures, tables, and other supplementary information. Although demonstrated in biodiversity, our methodology is not limited to this field; it can be applied across other scientific domains where detailed methodological reporting is essential for advancing knowledge and ensuring reproducibility. This study presents a scalable and reliable approach for automating information extraction, facilitating better reproducibility and knowledge transfer across studies.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate this drawback, we aim to present a comprehensive multilingual multitask benchmark. First, we present a pipeline for selecting available and reasonable benchmarks from massive ones, addressing the oversight in previous work regarding the utility of these benchmarks, i.e., their ability to differentiate between models being evaluated. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce P-MMEval, a large-scale benchmark covering effective fundamental and capability-specialized datasets. Furthermore, P-MMEval delivers consistent language coverage across various datasets and provides parallel samples. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on representative multilingual model series to compare performances across models, analyze dataset effectiveness, examine prompt impacts on model performances, and explore the relationship between multilingual performances and factors such as tasks, model sizes, and languages. These insights offer valuable guidance for future research. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Qwen/P-MMEval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustful LLMs: Customizing and Grounding Text Generation with Knowledge Bases and Dual Decoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07870v2)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although people are impressed by the content generation skills of large language models, the use of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is limited by the domain grounding of the content. The correctness and groundedness of the generated content need to be based on a verified context, such as results from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One important issue when adapting LLMs to a customized domain is that the generated responses are often incomplete, or the additions are not verified and may even be hallucinated. Prior studies on hallucination detection have focused on evaluation metrics, which are not easily adaptable to dynamic domains and can be vulnerable to attacks like jail-breaking. In this work, we propose 1) a post-processing algorithm that leverages knowledge triplets in RAG context to correct hallucinations and 2) a dual-decoder model that fuses RAG context to guide the generation process.</p></details> |  |

Code-mixing introduces unique challenges in daily life, such as syntactic mismatches and semantic blending, that are rarely encountered in monolingual settings. Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by offering unprecedented capabilities in understanding human languages. However, the effectiveness of current state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs has not yet been fully explored in the CM scenario. To fill this gap, we first benchmark the performance of multilingual LLMs on various code-mixing NLP tasks. Then we propose to improve the multilingual LLMs' ability to understand code-mixing through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and code-mixed machine translation tasks. Given the high-cost and time-consuming preference labeling procedure, we improve this by utilizing LLMs as annotators to perform the reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF). The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>initi...</summary><p>initial version: 5 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Refusal in LLMs is an Affine Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09003v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose affine concept editing (ACE) as an approach for steering language models' behavior by intervening directly in activations. We begin with an affine decomposition of model activation vectors and show that prior methods for steering model behavior correspond to subsets of terms of this decomposition. We then provide a derivation of ACE and test it on refusal using Llama 3 8B and Hermes Eagle RWKV v5. ACE ultimately combines affine subspace projection and activation addition to reliably control the model's refusal responses across prompt types. We evaluate the results using LLM-based scoring on a collection of harmful and harmless prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that ACE consistently achieves more precise control over model behavior and generalizes to models where directional ablation via affine subspace projection alone produces incoherent outputs. Code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/steering-llama3 .</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the quality of their input prompts. Recent studies have also shown that LLMs exhibit remarkable results in code-related tasks. To leverage the capabilities of LLMs in text classification, we propose the Code Completion Prompt (CoCoP) method, which transforms the text classification problem into a code completion task. CoCoP significantly improves text classification performance across diverse datasets by utilizing LLMs' code-completion capability. For instance, CoCoP enhances the accuracy of the SST2 dataset by more than 20%. Moreover, when CoCoP integrated with LLMs specifically designed for code-related tasks (code models), such as CodeLLaMA, this method demonstrates better or comparable performance to few-shot learning techniques while using only one-tenth of the model size. The source code of our proposed method will be available to the public upon the acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness and Confounders in the Demographic Alignment of LLMs with Human Perceptions of Offensiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08977v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit demographic biases, yet few studies systematically evaluate these biases across multiple datasets or account for confounding factors. In this work, we examine LLM alignment with human annotations in five offensive language datasets, comprising approximately 220K annotations. Our findings reveal that while demographic traits, particularly race, influence alignment, these effects are inconsistent across datasets and often entangled with other factors. Confounders -- such as document difficulty, annotator sensitivity, and within-group agreement -- account for more variation in alignment patterns than demographic traits alone. Specifically, alignment increases with higher annotator sensitivity and group agreement, while greater document difficulty corresponds to reduced alignment. Our results underscore the importance of multi-dataset analyses and confounder-aware methodologies in developing robust measures of demographic bias in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures, ACL'25</p></details> |

Unlike traditional methods, which require complex prompt engineering or white-box access, LLMStinger uses a reinforcement learning (RL) loop to fine-tune an attacker LLM, generating new suffixes based on existing attacks for harmful questions from the HarmBench benchmark. Our method significantly outperforms existing red-teaming approaches (we compared against 15 of the latest methods), achieving a +57.2% improvement in Attack Success Rate (ASR) on LLaMA2-7B-chat and a +50.3% ASR increase on Claude 2, both models known for their extensive safety measures. Additionally, we achieved a 94.97% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 99.4% on Gemma-2B-it, demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of LLMStinger across open and closed-source models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Recent work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as general world simulators to simulate the dynamics of the world due to their generalizability. LLMs also serve as the world model for deliberative reasoning in Reasoning via Planning (RAP) and Tree of Thought (ToT). However, the world models are either evaluated as a general world simulator, or as a functional module of the agent, i.e., predicting the transitions to assist the planning. In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of the world models with LLMs from the decision making perspective. Specifically, we leverage the 31 diverse environments from (Wang et al., 2023;2024) and curate the rule-based policy of each environment for the diverse evaluation. Then, we design three main tasks, i.e., policy verification, action proposal, and policy planning, where the world models can be used for decision making solely. Finally, we conduct the comprehensive evaluation of the advanced LLMs, i.e., GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, on the environments for the three main tasks under various settings. The key observations include: i) GPT-4o significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini on the three main tasks, especially for the tasks which require the domain knowledge, ii) the performance of the world model with LLM will be decreased for long-term decision-making tasks, and iii) the combination of different functionalities of the world model will brings additional unstabilities of the performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scholarly Wikidata: Population and Exploration of Conference Data in Wikidata using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08696v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several initiatives have been undertaken to conceptually model the domain of scholarly data using ontologies and to create respective Knowledge Graphs. Yet, the full potential seems unleashed, as automated means for automatic population of said ontologies are lacking, and respective initiatives from the Semantic Web community are not necessarily connected: we propose to make scholarly data more sustainably accessible by leveraging Wikidata's infrastructure and automating its population in a sustainable manner through LLMs by tapping into unstructured sources like conference Web sites and proceedings texts as well as already existing structured conference datasets. While an initial analysis shows that Semantic Web conferences are only minimally represented in Wikidata, we argue that our methodology can help to populate, evolve and maintain scholarly data as a community within Wikidata. Our main contributions include (a) an analysis of ontologies for representing scholarly data to identify gaps and relevant entities/properties in Wikidata, (b) semi-automated extraction -- requiring (minimal) manual validation -- of conference metadata (e.g., acceptance rates, organizer roles, programme committee members, best paper awards, keynotes, and sponsors) from websites and proceedings texts using LLMs. Finally, we discuss (c) extensions to visualization tools in the Wikidata context for data exploration of the generated scholarly data. Our study focuses on data from 105 Semantic Web-related conferences and extends/adds more than 6000 entities in Wikidata. It is important to note that the method can be more generally applicable beyond Semantic Web-related conferences for enhancing Wikidata's utility as a comprehensive scholarly resource.

Watermarking, a technique that aims to embed information in the output of a model to verify its source, is useful for mitigating the misuse of such AI-generated content. However, we show that common design choices in LLM watermarking schemes make the resulting systems surprisingly susceptible to attack -- leading to fundamental trade-offs in robustness, utility, and usability. To navigate these trade-offs, we rigorously study a set of simple yet effective attacks on common watermarking systems, and propose guidelines and defenses for LLM watermarking in practice.</p></details> |  |

For all its promises, and like any technological advancement, O-RAN is not without risks that need to be carefully assessed and properly addressed to accelerate its wide adoption in future mobile networks. In this paper, we present an in-depth security analysis of the O-RAN architecture, discussing the potential threats that may arise in the different O-RAN architecture layers and their impact on the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad. We also promote the potential of zero trust, Moving Target Defense (MTD), blockchain, and large language models(LLM) technologies in fortifying O-RAN's security posture. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of MTD in empowering robust deep reinforcement learning methods for dynamic network slice admission control in the O-RAN architecture. Moreover, we examine the effect of explainable AI (XAI) based on LLMs in securing the system.</p></details> | 10 pages |

This is particularly true when updating LLMs with datasets that necessitate domain-expert reasoning across extensive texts, despite limited samples. We termed the scenario as the Few-Shot Domain-Expert Reasoning for Updating LLMs (FDoR-UL). Traditional methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) are inadequate for addressing this critical issue, particularly evident in our exploration of a specific medical dataset that epitomizes the distinct needs of FDoR-UL. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Sequential Fusion method to integrate knowledge from complex contexts into LLMs. This method employs a two-stage framework: initially leveraging general LLMs to perform relation extraction for knowledge acquisition from complex texts, followed by updating domain-specific LLMs through Knowledge Editing (KE). Employing our method, domain-specific LLMs achieved a 71.7% accuracy (an average gain of 39.1%) in question-answering tasks. Furthermore, we expanded our evaluation to a novel economics-management dataset we developed, where our method achieved a 75.0% accuracy (an average gain of 45.0%). These findings underscore the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach in FDoR-UL across various domains.</p></details> | Working in progress |

This study addresses this gap by collecting and mapping the topics practitioners discuss online, offering practical insights into where priorities lie in developing LLM-based applications. \textit{Method}: We collected 189 videos from 2022 to 2024 from practitioners actively developing such systems and discussing various aspects they encounter during development and deployment of LLMs in production. We analyzed the transcripts using BERTopic, then manually sorted and merged the generated topics into themes, leading to a total of 20 topics in 8 themes. \textit{Results}: The most prevalent topics fall within the theme Design \& Architecture, with a strong focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Other frequently discussed topics include model capabilities and enhancement techniques (e.g., fine-tuning, prompt engineering), infrastructure and tooling, and risks and ethical challenges. \textit{Implications}: Our results highlight current discussions and challenges in deploying LLMs in production. This way, we provide a systematic overview of key aspects practitioners should be aware of when developing LLM-based applications. We further pale off topics of interest for academics where further research is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Predictive Insights in Food Policy and Behavioral Interventions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08563v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Food consumption and production contribute significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, making them crucial entry points for mitigating climate change and maintaining a liveable planet. Over the past two decades, food policy initiatives have explored interventions to reshape production and consumption patterns, focusing on reducing food waste and curbing ruminant meat consumption. While the evidence of "what works" improves, evaluating which policies are appropriate and effective in specific contexts remains difficult due to external validity challenges. This paper demonstrates that a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) can accurately predict the direction of outcomes in approximately 80\% of empirical studies measuring dietary-based impacts (e.g. food choices, sales, waste) resulting from behavioral interventions and policies. Approximately 75 prompts were required to achieve optimal results, with performance showing signs of catastrophic loss beyond this point. Our findings indicate that greater input detail enhances predictive accuracy, although the model still faces challenges with unseen studies, underscoring the importance of a representative training sample. As LLMs continue to improve and diversify, they hold promise for advancing data-driven, evidence-based policymaking.</p></details> |  |

Even though their capabilities of data synthesis have been studied well in recent years, the generated data suffers from a lack of diversity, less adherence to the prompt, and potential biases that creep into the data from the generator model. In this work, we tackle the challenge of generating datasets with high diversity, upon which a student model is trained for downstream tasks. Taking the route of decoding-time guidance-based approaches, we propose CorrSynth, which generates data that is more diverse and faithful to the input prompt using a correlated sampling strategy. Further, our method overcomes the complexity drawbacks of some other guidance-based techniques like classifier-based guidance. With extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our approach and substantiate our claims. In particular, we perform intrinsic evaluation to show the improvements in diversity. Our experiments show that CorrSynth improves both student metrics and intrinsic metrics upon competitive baselines across four datasets, showing the innate advantage of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a main conference paper at EMNLP 2024; First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in advancing the natural language understanding frontier, their application to large-scale tabular data presents significant challenges, specifically regarding table size and complex intricate relationships. Existing works have shown promise with small-scale tables but often flounder when tasked with the complex reasoning required by larger, interconnected tables found in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce "Tree-of-Table", a novel approach designed to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities over large and complex tables. Our method employs Table Condensation and Decomposition to distill and reorganize relevant data into a manageable format, followed by the construction of a hierarchical Table-Tree that facilitates tree-structured reasoning. Through a meticulous Table-Tree Execution process, we systematically unravel the tree-structured reasoning chain to derive the solutions. Experiments across diverse datasets, including WikiTQ, TableFact, FeTaQA, and BIRD, demonstrate that Tree-of-Table sets a new benchmark with superior performance, showcasing remarkable efficiency and generalization capabilities in large-scale table reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CorrectBench: Automatic Testbench Generation with Functional Self-Correction using LLMs for HDL Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08510v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional simulation is an essential step in digital hardware design. Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for hardware testbench generation tasks. However, the inherent instability associated with LLMs often leads to functional errors in the generated testbenches. Previous methods do not incorporate automatic functional correction mechanisms without human intervention and still suffer from low success rates, especially for sequential tasks. To address this issue, we propose CorrectBench, an automatic testbench generation framework with functional self-validation and self-correction. Utilizing only the RTL specification in natural language, the proposed approach can validate the correctness of the generated testbenches with a success rate of 88.85%. Furthermore, the proposed LLM-based corrector employs bug information obtained during the self-validation process to perform functional self-correction on the generated testbenches. The comparative analysis demonstrates that our method achieves a pass ratio of 70.13% across all evaluated tasks, compared with the previous LLM-based testbench generation framework's 52.18% and a direct LLM-based generation method's 33.33%. Specifically in sequential circuits, our work's performance is 62.18% higher than previous work in sequential tasks and almost 5 times the pass ratio of the direct method. The codes and experimental results are open-sourced at the link: https://github.com/AutoBench/CorrectBench</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Qualitative Insights: Leveraging LLMs to Market Predict](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08404v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to transform financial analytics by integrating numerical and textual data. However, challenges such as insufficient context when fusing multimodal information and the difficulty in measuring the utility of qualitative outputs, which LLMs generate as text, have limited their effectiveness in tasks such as financial forecasting. This study addresses these challenges by leveraging daily reports from securities firms to create high-quality contextual information. The reports are segmented into text-based key factors and combined with numerical data, such as price information, to form context sets. By dynamically updating few-shot examples based on the query time, the sets incorporate the latest information, forming a highly relevant set closely aligned with the query point. Additionally, a crafted prompt is designed to assign scores to the key factors, converting qualitative insights into quantitative results. The derived scores undergo a scaling process, transforming them into real-world values that are used for prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs outperform time-series models in market forecasting, though challenges such as imperfect reproducibility and limited explainability remain.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

However, translating rare words in low-resource or domain-specific contexts remains challenging for LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a multi-step prompt chain that enhances translation faithfulness by prioritizing key terms crucial for semantic accuracy. Our method first identifies these keywords and retrieves their translations from a bilingual dictionary, integrating them into the LLM's context using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We further mitigate potential output hallucinations caused by long prompts through an iterative self-checking mechanism, where the LLM refines its translations based on lexical and semantic constraints. Experiments using Llama and Qwen as base models on the FLORES-200 and WMT datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing translation faithfulness and robustness, particularly in low-resource scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating LLMs' ability to follow instructions remains challenging due to the complexity and subjectivity of human language. Current benchmarks primarily focus on single-turn, monolingual instructions, which do not adequately reflect the complexities of real-world applications that require handling multi-turn and multilingual interactions. To address this gap, we introduce Multi-IF, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs' proficiency in following multi-turn and multilingual instructions. Multi-IF, which utilizes a hybrid framework combining LLM and human annotators, expands upon the IFEval by incorporating multi-turn sequences and translating the English prompts into another 7 languages, resulting in a dataset of 4,501 multilingual conversations, where each has three turns. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs on Multi-IF reveals that it presents a significantly more challenging task than existing benchmarks. All the models tested showed a higher rate of failure in executing instructions correctly with each additional turn. For example, o1-preview drops from 0.877 at the first turn to 0.707 at the third turn in terms of average accuracy over all languages. Moreover, languages with non-Latin scripts (Hindi, Russian, and Chinese) generally exhibit higher error rates, suggesting potential limitations in the models' multilingual capabilities. We release Multi-IF prompts and the evaluation code base to encourage further research in this critical area.</p></details> |  |

A Continuous Evaluation using Daily News as the Oracle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08324v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing evaluation benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) quickly become outdated due to the emergence of new models and training data. These benchmarks also fall short in assessing how LLM performance changes over time, as they consist of static questions without a temporal dimension. To address these limitations, we propose using future event prediction as a continuous evaluation method to assess LLMs' temporal generalization and forecasting abilities. Our benchmark, Daily Oracle, automatically generates question-answer (QA) pairs from daily news, challenging LLMs to predict "future" event outcomes. Our findings reveal that as pre-training data becomes outdated, LLM performance degrades over time. While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy, the performance degradation pattern persists, highlighting the need for continuous model updates.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose TSFormer, an all-in-one framework that integrates \textbf{T}rusted learning with \textbf{S}parsification to boost both generalization capability and computational efficiency in UHD image restoration. The key is that only a small amount of token movement is allowed within the model. To efficiently filter tokens, we use Min-$p$ with random matrix theory to quantify the uncertainty of tokens, thereby improving the robustness of the model. Our model can run a 4K image in real time (40fps) with 3.38 M parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSFormer achieves state-of-the-art restoration quality while enhancing generalization and reducing computational demands. In addition, our token filtering method can be applied to other image restoration models to effectively accelerate inference and maintain performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAT: Hybrid Attention Transformer for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05239v2)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have shown impressive performance in image restoration tasks, such as image super-resolution and denoising. However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for better restoration, we propose a new Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines both channel attention and window-based self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a same-task pre-training strategy to further exploit the potential of the model for further improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We further scale up the model to show that the performance of the SR task can be greatly improved. Besides, we extend HAT to more image restoration applications, including real-world image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising and image compression artifacts reduction. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that our HAT achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/XPixelGroup/HAT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of HAT. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2205.04437</p></details> |

Nevertheless, handling the complex and diverse degradations encountered in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To tackle this, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network. In the fine-tuning stage, we refine the pre-trained IR network through low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Built upon a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, LoRA-IR dynamically integrates multiple low-rank restoration experts through a degradation-guided router. This dynamic integration mechanism significantly enhances our model's adaptability to diverse and unknown degradations in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-IR achieves SOTA performance across 14 IR tasks and 29 benchmarks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Code and pre-trained models will be available at: https://github.com/shallowdream204/LoRA-IR.</p></details> |  |
| **[AllRestorer: All-in-One Transformer for Image Restoration under Composite Degradations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10708v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration models often face the simultaneous interaction of multiple degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing approaches typically handle single or composite degradations based on scene descriptors derived from text or image embeddings. However, due to the varying proportions of different degradations within an image, these scene descriptors may not accurately differentiate between degradations, leading to suboptimal restoration in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based restoration framework, AllRestorer. In AllRestorer, we enable the model to adaptively consider all image impairments, thereby avoiding errors from scene descriptor misdirection. Specifically, we introduce an All-in-One Transformer Block (AiOTB), which adaptively removes all degradations present in a given image by modeling the relationships between all degradations and the image embedding in latent space. To accurately address different variations potentially present within the same type of degradation and minimize ambiguity, AiOTB utilizes a composite scene descriptor consisting of both image and text embeddings to define the degradation. Furthermore, AiOTB includes an adaptive weight for each degradation, allowing for precise control of the restoration intensity. By leveraging AiOTB, AllRestorer avoids misdirection caused by inaccurate scene descriptors, achieving a 5.00 dB increase in PSNR compared to the baseline on the CDD-11 dataset.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

We propose the Probabilistic Prior Turbulence Removal Network (PPTRN), which combines probabilistic diffusion-based prior modeling with Transformer-driven feature extraction to address this issue. PPTRN employs a two-stage approach: first, a latent encoder and Transformer are jointly trained on clear images to establish robust feature representations. Then, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) models prior distributions over latent vectors, guiding the Transformer in capturing diverse feature variations essential for restoration. A key innovation in PPTRN is the Probabilistic Prior Driven Cross Attention mechanism, which integrates the DDPM-generated prior with feature embeddings to reduce artifacts and enhance spatial coherence. Extensive experiments validate that PPTRN significantly improves restoration quality on turbulence-degraded images, setting a new benchmark in clarity and structural fidelity.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 3 tables |

Current image restoration methods struggle to handle complex degradation while maintaining efficiency. This paper introduces a novel image restoration architecture that combines multi-dimensional dynamic attention and self-attention within a U-Net framework. To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks.

To this end, we develop an adaptive degradation-aware self-prompting model (ADSM) for all-in-one weather-degraded image restoration. Specifically, our model employs the contrastive language-image pre-training model (CLIP) to facilitate the training of our proposed latent prompt generators (LPGs), which represent three types of latent prompts to characterize the degradation type, degradation property and image caption. Moreover, we integrate the acquired degradation-aware prompts into the time embedding of diffusion model to improve degradation perception. Meanwhile, we employ the latent caption prompt to guide the reverse sampling process using the cross-attention mechanism, thereby guiding the accurate image reconstruction. Furthermore, to accelerate the reverse sampling procedure of diffusion model and address the limitations of frequency perception, we introduce a wavelet-oriented noise estimating network (WNE-Net). Extensive experiments conducted on eight publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both task-specific and all-in-one applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Frequency Enhancement Network for Blind Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06893v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image deblurring is an essential image preprocessing technique, aiming to recover clear and detailed images form blurry ones. However, existing algorithms often fail to effectively integrate multi-scale feature extraction with frequency enhancement, limiting their ability to reconstruct fine textures. Additionally, non-uniform blur in images also restricts the effectiveness of image restoration. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale frequency enhancement network (MFENet) for blind image deblurring. To capture the multi-scale spatial and channel information of blurred images, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction module (MS-FE) based on depthwise separable convolutions, which provides rich target features for deblurring. We propose a frequency enhanced blur perception module (FEBP) that employs wavelet transforms to extract high-frequency details and utilizes multi-strip pooling to perceive non-uniform blur, combining multi-scale information with frequency enhancement to improve the restoration of image texture details. Experimental results on the GoPro and HIDE datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior deblurring performance in both visual quality and objective evaluation metrics. Furthermore, in downstream object detection tasks, the proposed blind image deblurring algorithm significantly improves detection accuracy, further validating its effectiveness androbustness in the field of image deblurring.</p></details> |  |

The restoration of UHD images is a highly challenging problem due to the exaggerated pixel count, which often leads to memory overflow during processing. Existing methods either downsample UHD images at a high rate before processing or split them into multiple patches for separate processing. However, high-rate downsampling leads to significant information loss, while patch-based approaches inevitably introduce boundary artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel design paradigm to solve the UHD image restoration problem, called D2Net. D2Net enables direct full-resolution inference on UHD images without the need for high-rate downsampling or dividing the images into several patches. Specifically, we ingeniously utilize the characteristics of the frequency domain to establish long-range dependencies of features. Taking into account the richer local patterns in UHD images, we also design a multi-scale convolutional group to capture local features. Additionally, during the decoding stage, we dynamically incorporate features from the encoding stage to reduce the flow of irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on three UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring, show that our model achieves better quantitative and qualitative results than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | WACV2025 |
| **[A Modular Conditional Diffusion Framework for Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05993v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have been recently utilized to deal with various blind image restoration (IR) tasks, where they have demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of perceptual quality. However, the task-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational costs related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging to use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This hinders their wider adoption, especially by those who lack access to powerful computational resources and vast amount of training data. In this work we aim to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the performance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a relatively small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest. Moreover, the architecture of the proposed framework allows for a sampling strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function evaluations without suffering any performance loss, while it can also be combined with existing acceleration techniques such as DDIM. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality while it retains a competitive performance with respect to fidelity metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR) methods based on a pre-trained diffusion model have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, they have two fundamental limitations: 1) they often assume that the degradation operator is completely known and 2) they alter the diffusion sampling process, which may result in restored images that do not lie onto the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e, not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/hamadichihaoui/BIRD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2024</p></details> |

In this context, the key issue lies in how to deal with different types of degraded images simultaneously. In this work, we present a Degradation-Aware Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (DA-RCOT) approach that models (all-in-one) image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we formalize image restoration with a residual-guided OT objective by exploiting the degradation-specific patterns of the Fourier residual in the transport cost. More crucially, we design the transport map for restoration as a two-pass DA-RCOT map, in which the transport residual is computed in the first pass and then encoded as multi-scale residual embeddings to condition the second-pass restoration. This conditioning process injects intrinsic degradation knowledge (e.g., degradation type and level) and structural information from the multi-scale residual embeddings into the OT map, which thereby can dynamically adjust its behaviors for all-in-one restoration. Extensive experiments across five degradations demonstrate the favorable performance of DA-RCOT as compared to state-of-the-art methods, in terms of distortion measures, perceptual quality, and image structure preservation. Notably, DA-RCOT delivers superior adaptability to real-world scenarios even with multiple degradations and shows distinctive robustness to both degradation levels and the number of degradations.</p></details> |  |

Despite its innovative approach to seamless display integration, UDC technology faces unique image degradation challenges exacerbated by the susceptibility to adversarial perturbations. Our research initially conducts an in-depth robustness evaluation of deep-learning-based UDC image restoration models by employing several white-box and black-box attacking methods. This evaluation is pivotal in understanding the vulnerabilities of current UDC image restoration techniques. Following the assessment, we introduce a defense framework integrating adversarial purification with subsequent fine-tuning processes. First, our approach employs diffusion-based adversarial purification, effectively neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Then, we apply the fine-tuning methodologies to refine the image restoration models further, ensuring that the quality and fidelity of the restored images are maintained. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments, showing marked improvements in resilience against typical adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Failu...</summary><p>Failure to meet expectations</p></details> |

We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4x super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps.

This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed. Furthermore, regarding underwater image restoration, Aquatic-GS outperforms representative dewatering methods in color correction, detail recovery, and stability.

Meanwhile, researchers also proposed extremely compact, under-parameterized image priors (e.g., deep decoder) that are strikingly competent for image restoration too, despite a loss of accuracy. These two extremes push us to think whether there exists a better solution in the middle: between over- and under-parameterized image priors, can one identify "intermediate" parameterized image priors that achieve better trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and even preserving strong transferability? Drawing inspirations from the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), we conjecture and study a novel "lottery image prior" (LIP) by exploiting DNN inherent sparsity, stated as: given an over-parameterized DNN-based image prior, it will contain a sparse subnetwork that can be trained in isolation, to match the original DNN's performance when being applied as a prior to various image inverse problems. Our results validate the superiority of LIPs: we can successfully locate the LIP subnetworks from over-parameterized DIPs at substantial sparsity ranges. Those LIP subnetworks significantly outperform deep decoders under comparably compact model sizes (by often fully preserving the effectiveness of their over-parameterized counterparts), and they also possess high transferability across different images as well as restoration task types. Besides, we also extend LIP to compressive sensing image reconstruction, where a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the prior (in contrast to untrained DIP or deep decoder), and confirm its validity in this setting too. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that LTH is demonstrated to be relevant in the context of inverse problems or image priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Chasing-Better-DIPs</p></details> |

While reducing injected radiation dose mitigates this risk, it often compromises image quality. To reconstruct full-dose-quality images from low-dose scans, we propose a Cycle-constrained Adversarial Denoising Convolutional Network (Cycle-DCN). This model integrates a noise predictor, two discriminators, and a consistency network, and is optimized using a combination of supervised loss, adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, identity loss, and neighboring Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset consisting of raw PET brain data from 1,224 patients, acquired using a Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner. Each patient underwent a 120-seconds brain scan. To simulate low-dose PET conditions, images were reconstructed from shortened scan durations of 30, 12, and 5 seconds, corresponding to 1/4, 1/10, and 1/24 of the full-dose acquisition, respectively, using a custom-developed GPU-based image reconstruction software. The results show that Cycle-DCN significantly improves average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), SSIM, and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) across three dose levels, with improvements of up to 56%, 35%, and 71%, respectively. Additionally, it achieves contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) values that closely align with full-dose images, effectively preserving image details, tumor shape, and contrast, while resolving issues with blurred edges. The results of reader studies indicated that the images restored by Cycle-DCN consistently received the highest ratings from nuclear medicine physicians, highlighting their strong clinical relevance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images.

Nevertheless, it encounters challenges related to ill-posed problems, resulting in deviations between single model predictions and ground-truths. Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning technique, aims to address these deviations by combining the predictions of multiple base models. Most existing works adopt ensemble learning during the design of restoration models, while only limited research focuses on the inference-stage ensemble of pre-trained restoration models. Regression-based methods fail to enable efficient inference, leading researchers in academia and industry to prefer averaging as their choice for post-training ensemble. To address this, we reformulate the ensemble problem of image restoration into Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and employ an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm to estimate ensemble weights for aggregating prediction candidates. We estimate the range-wise ensemble weights on a reference set and store them in a lookup table (LUT) for efficient ensemble inference on the test set. Our algorithm is model-agnostic and training-free, allowing seamless integration and enhancement of various pre-trained image restoration models. It consistently outperforms regression based methods and averaging ensemble approaches on 14 benchmarks across 3 image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring and deraining. The codes and all estimated weights have been released in Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages for main manuscript, additional 17 pages for appendix, 18 figures, 17MB</p></details> |

To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model. GenIR, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation & filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality images. Our second contribution, DreamClear, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restoration. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address. Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration.

However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. Hallucinations in these models create uncertainty about their reliability, raising major concerns about their practical application. This paper investigates this phenomenon through the lens of information theory, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through experiments with super-resolution and inpainting algorithms. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. Thus, we aim to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Deep Identity Learning (DIL), a novel learning strategy that includes a dedicated regularization term based on the properties of linear systems, to exploit the identity relation between the degradation and inverse degradation models. The salient aspect of our proposed framework is it neither relies on a deblurring dataset nor a single input blurry image (e.g. Polyblur, a self-supervised method). This framework detours the typical degradation kernel estimation step involved in most of the existing blind deblurring solutions by the proposition of our Random Kernel Gallery (RKG) dataset. The proposed approach extends our previous Image Super-Resolution (ISR) work, NSSR-DIL, to the image deblurring task. In this work, we updated the regularization term in DIL based on Fourier transform properties of the identity relation, to deliver robust performance across a wide range of degradations. Besides the regularization term, we provide an explicit and compact representation of the learned deep linear network in a matrix form, called Deep Restoration Kernel (DRK) to perform image restoration. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional and deep learning based deblurring methods, with at least an order of 100 lesser computational resources. The D3 model, both LCNN & DRK, can be effortlessly extended to the Image Super-Resolution (ISR) task as well to restore the low-resolution images with fine details. The D3 model and its kernel form representation (DRK) are lightweight yet robust and restore the blurry input in a fraction of a second.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real-ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real-ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model-based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps.

Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility.

To address these challenges, we propose an innovative object detection algorithm specifically designed for blurry images, named DREB-Net (Dual-stream Restoration Embedding Blur-feature Fusion Network). First, DREB-Net addresses the particularities of blurry image object detection problem by incorporating a Blurry image Restoration Auxiliary Branch (BRAB) during the training phase. Second, it fuses the extracted shallow features via Multi-level Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (MAGFF) module, to extract richer features. Here, the MAGFF module comprises local attention modules and global attention modules, which assign different weights to the branches. Then, during the inference phase, the deep feature extraction of the BRAB can be removed to reduce computational complexity and improve detection speed. In loss function, a combined loss of MSE and SSIM is added to the BRAB to restore blurry images. Finally, DREB-Net introduces Fast Fourier Transform in the early stages of feature extraction, via a Learnable Frequency domain Amplitude Modulation Module (LFAMM), to adjust feature amplitude and enhance feature processing capability. Experimental results indicate that DREB-Net can still effectively perform object detection tasks under motion blur in captured images, showcasing excellent performance and broad application prospects.

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Priors for Variational Likelihood Estimation and Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17521v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world noise removal is crucial in low-level computer vision. Due to the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent attention has shifted towards leveraging diffusion priors for image restoration tasks. However, existing diffusion priors-based methods either consider simple noise types or rely on approximate posterior estimation, limiting their effectiveness in addressing structured and signal-dependent noise commonly found in real-world images. In this paper, we build upon diffusion priors and propose adaptive likelihood estimation and MAP inference during the reverse diffusion process to tackle real-world noise. We introduce an independent, non-identically distributed likelihood combined with the noise precision (inverse variance) prior and dynamically infer the precision posterior using variational Bayes during the generation process. Meanwhile, we rectify the estimated noise variance through local Gaussian convolution. The final denoised image is obtained by propagating intermediate MAP solutions that balance the updated likelihood and diffusion prior. Additionally, we explore the local diffusion prior inherent in low-resolution diffusion models, enabling direct handling of high-resolution noisy images. Extensive experiments and analyses on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level. Related source codes and pre-trained parameters were public in https://github.com/puppy210/DaLPSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on All-in-One Image Restoration: Taxonomy, Evaluation and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15067v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) refers to the process of improving visual quality of images while removing degradation, such as noise, blur, weather effects, and so on. Traditional IR methods typically target specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance both convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this review, we delve into the AiOIR methodologies, emphasizing their architecture innovations and learning paradigm and offering a systematic review of prevalent approaches. We systematically categorize prevalent approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to advance this dynamic field. Our paper begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of cutting-edge designs based on factors such as prior knowledge and generalization capability. Next, we highlight key advancements in AiOIR, aiming to inspire further inquiry and innovation within the community. To facilitate a robust evaluation of existing methods, we collate and summarize commonly used datasets, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present an objective comparison of open-sourced methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners alike. This paper stands as the first comprehensive and insightful review of AiOIR. A related repository is available at https://github.com/Harbinzzy/All-in-One-Image-Restoration-Survey.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter Efficient Adaptation for Image Restoration with Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08881v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing single-task image restoration models for specific degradation has seen great success in recent years. To achieve generalized image restoration, all-in-one methods have recently been proposed and shown potential for multiple restoration tasks using one single model. Despite the promising results, the existing all-in-one paradigm still suffers from high computational costs as well as limited generalization on unseen degradations. In this work, we introduce an alternative solution to improve the generalization of image restoration models. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), we aim to tune only a small number of parameters to adapt pre-trained restoration models to various tasks. However, current PETL methods fail to generalize across varied restoration tasks due to their homogeneous representation nature. To this end, we propose AdaptIR, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with orthogonal multi-branch design to capture local spatial, global spatial, and channel representation bases, followed by adaptive base combination to obtain heterogeneous representation for different degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AdaptIR achieves stable performance on single-degradation tasks, and excels in hybrid-degradation tasks, with fine-tuning only 0.6% parameters for 8 hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Deep learning-based image restoration has emerged as a promising solution capable of generating high-resolution and motion-artifact-free MRI images from low-resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition times or from motion-artifact-corrupted images. To facilitate clinical integration, a time- and GPU-efficient network with reliable accuracy is essential. In this study, we adopted a unified 2D deep learning framework for pseudo-3D MRI image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) and motion artifact reduction (MAR). The optimal down-sampling factors to optimize the acquisition time in SRR were identified. Training for MAR was performed using publicly available in vivo data, employing a novel standardized method to induce motion artifacts of varying severity in a controlled way. The accuracy of the network was evaluated through a pixel-wise uncertainty map, and performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrated that the down-sampling factor of 1x1x2 for x2 acceleration and 2x2x2 for x4 acceleration was optimal. For SRR, the proposed TS-RCAN outperformed the 3D networks of mDCSRN and ReCNN, with an improvement of more than 0.01 in SSIM and 1.5 dB in PSNR while reducing GPU load by up to and inference time by up to 90%. For MAR, TS-RCAN exceeded UNet's performance by up to 0.014 in SSIM and 1.48 dB in PSNR. Additionally, TS-RCAN provided uncertainty information, which can be used to estimate the quality of the reconstructed images. TS-RCAN has potential use for SRR and MAR in the clinical setting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fusion from Decomposition: A Self-Supervised Approach for Image Fusion and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12274v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion is famous as an alternative solution to generate one high-quality image from multiple images in addition to image restoration from a single degraded image. The essence of image fusion is to integrate complementary information from source images. Existing fusion methods struggle with generalization across various tasks and often require labor-intensive designs, in which it is difficult to identify and extract useful information from source images due to the diverse requirements of each fusion task. Additionally, these methods develop highly specialized features for different downstream applications, hindering the adaptation to new and diverse downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFusion++, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to enhance the versatility of feature representation for different image fusion tasks. DeFusion++ captures the image fusion task-friendly representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way, overcoming the constraints of limited fusion datasets. Specifically, we introduce two innovative pretext tasks: common and unique decomposition (CUD) and masked feature modeling (MFM). CUD decomposes source images into abstract common and unique components, while MFM refines these components into robust fused features. Jointly training of these tasks enables DeFusion++ to produce adaptable representations that can effectively extract useful information from various source images, regardless of the fusion task. The resulting fused representations are also highly adaptable for a wide range of downstream tasks, including image segmentation and object detection. DeFusion++ stands out by producing versatile fused representations that can enhance both the quality of image fusion and the effectiveness of downstream high-level vision tasks, simplifying the process with the elegant fusion framework.</p></details> | 18page |
| **[Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration: New Benchmarks and A Dual Interaction Prior-Driven Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13607v4)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration has acquired remarkable attention due to its practical demand. In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, dehazing, deblurring, desonwing, and deraining.

However, efforts to extend these advancements to video scenarios have been minimal, partly because of the absence of benchmarks that allow for a comprehensive and fair comparison. In this work, we first present a fair evaluation benchmark, in which we first introduce a Real-world Low-Quality Face Video benchmark (RFV-LQ), evaluate several leading image-based face restoration algorithms, and conduct a thorough systematical analysis of the benefits and challenges associated with extending blind face image restoration algorithms to degraded face videos. Our analysis identifies several key issues, primarily categorized into two aspects: significant jitters in facial components and noise-shape flickering between frames. To address these issues, we propose a Temporal Consistency Network (TCN) cooperated with alignment smoothing to reduce jitters and flickers in restored videos. TCN is a flexible component that can be seamlessly plugged into the most advanced face image restoration algorithms, ensuring the quality of image-based restoration is maintained as closely as possible. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed TCN and alignment smoothing operation.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various unknown degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different types of degradation, forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration plug-and-play method that generates parameters based on the input image and thus makes the model to adapt to specific degradation dynamically. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and All-in-One settings. Notably, our proposed model Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve a given small enough error, our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to mainstream embedding-based All-in-One methods.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate the versatility of DDR as an image descriptor, with strong correlations observed with key image attributes such as complexity, colorfulness, sharpness, and overall quality. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of DDR across a spectrum of applications. It excels as a blind image quality assessment metric, outperforming existing methodologies across multiple datasets.

However, existing restoration backbones often face the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation, hindering their application in practice. Recently, the Selective Structured State Space Model, especially the improved version Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a way to resolve the above dilemma. However, the standard Mamba still faces certain challenges in low-level vision such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In this work, we introduce a simple but effective baseline, named MambaIR, which introduces both local enhancement and channel attention to improve the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of the local pixel similarity and reduces the channel redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms SwinIR by up to 0.45dB on image SR, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field.

| **[A Preliminary Exploration Towards General Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15143v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the tremendous success of deep models in various individual image restoration tasks, there are at least two major technical challenges preventing these works from being applied to real-world usages: (1) the lack of generalization ability and (2) the complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing deep models, tailored for specific individual image restoration tasks, often fall short in effectively addressing these challenges. In this paper, we present a new problem called general image restoration (GIR) which aims to address these challenges within a unified model. GIR covers most individual image restoration tasks (\eg, image denoising, deblurring, deraining and super-resolution) and their combinations for general purposes. This paper proceeds to delineate the essential aspects of GIR, including problem definition and the overarching significance of generalization performance. Moreover, the establishment of new datasets and a thorough evaluation framework for GIR models is discussed. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing approaches for tackling the GIR challenge, illuminating their strengths and pragmatic challenges. By analyzing these approaches, we not only underscore the effectiveness of GIR but also highlight the difficulties in its practical implementation. At last, we also try to understand and interpret these models' behaviors to inspire the future direction. Our work can open up new valuable research directions and contribute to the research of general vision.</p></details> |  |

The requirement to tackle multiple degradations using the same model can lead to high-complexity designs with fixed configuration that lack the adaptability to more efficient alternatives. We propose DyNet, a dynamic family of networks designed in an encoder-decoder style for all-in-one image restoration tasks. Our DyNet can seamlessly switch between its bulkier and lightweight variants, thereby offering flexibility for efficient model deployment with a single round of training. This seamless switching is enabled by our weights-sharing mechanism, forming the core of our architecture and facilitating the reuse of initialized module weights. Further, to establish robust weights initialization, we introduce a dynamic pre-training strategy that trains variants of the proposed DyNet concurrently, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GPU hours. Our dynamic pre-training strategy eliminates the need for maintaining separate checkpoints for each variant, as all models share a common set of checkpoints, varying only in model depth. This efficient strategy significantly reduces storage overhead and enhances adaptability. To tackle the unavailability of large-scale dataset required in pre-training, we curate a high-quality, high-resolution image dataset named Million-IRD, having 2M image samples. We validate our DyNet for image denoising, deraining, and dehazing in all-in-one setting, achieving state-of-the-art results with 31.34\% reduction in GFlops and a 56.75\% reduction in parameters compared to baseline models. The source codes and trained models are available at https://github.com/akshaydudhane16/DyNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes updates where the DyNet variants now share the same weights during inference as well, eliminating the need to store separate weights and thereby reducing device storage requirements.

| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image restoration algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08688v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite previous works typically targeting isolated degradation types, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations which involve a complex interplay of multiple different isolated degradations. Recognizing the challenges posed by the exponential number of possible degradation combinations, we propose Universal Image Restoration (UIR), a new task setting that requires models to be trained on a set of degradation bases and then remove any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought which prompts LLMs to address problems step-by-step, we propose the Chain-of-Restoration (CoR), which instructs models to step-by-step remove unknown composite degradations. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR significantly improves model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving results comparable to or surpassing those of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations. The code will be released at https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Existing methods achieve remarkable results for addressing single-weather conditions. However, they face challenges when encountering unpredictable weather conditions, which often happen in real-world scenarios. Although different weather conditions exhibit different degradation patterns, they share common characteristics that are highly related and complementary, such as occlusions caused by degradation patterns, color distortion, and contrast attenuation due to the scattering of atmospheric particles. Therefore, we focus on leveraging common knowledge across multiple weather conditions to restore images in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose a Triplet Attention Network (TANet) to efficiently and effectively address all-in-one adverse weather image restoration. TANet consists of Triplet Attention Block (TAB) that incorporates three types of attention mechanisms: Local Pixel-wise Attention (LPA) and Global Strip-wise Attention (GSA) to address occlusions caused by non-uniform degradation patterns, and Global Distribution Attention (GDA) to address color distortion and contrast attenuation caused by atmospheric phenomena. By leveraging common knowledge shared across different weather conditions, TANet successfully addresses multiple weather conditions in a unified manner. Experimental results show that TANet efficiently and effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance in all-in-one adverse weather image restoration.

Despite the impressive results achieved by these I2I models, their practical utility is hampered by their large model size and the computational burden of the iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel compression method tailored for diffusion-based I2I models. Based on the observations that the image conditions of I2I models already provide rich information on image structures, and that the time steps with a larger impact tend to be biased, we develop surprisingly simple yet effective approaches for reducing the model size and latency. We validate the effectiveness of our method on three representative I2I tasks: InstructPix2Pix for image editing, StableSR for image restoration, and ControlNet for image-conditional image generation. Our approach achieves satisfactory output quality with 39.2%, 56.4% and 39.2% reduction in model footprint, as well as 81.4%, 68.7% and 31.1% decrease in latency to InstructPix2Pix, StableSR and ControlNet, respectively.</p></details> | ACCV 2024 |

An effective strategy is to incorporate prior knowledge, either from human input or generative model. In this paper, we introduce Instant-reference Image Restoration (InstantIR), a novel diffusion-based BIR method which dynamically adjusts generation condition during inference. We first extract a compact representation of the input via a pre-trained vision encoder. At each generation step, this representation is used to decode current diffusion latent and instantiate it in the generative prior. The degraded image is then encoded with this reference, providing robust generation condition. We observe the variance of generative references fluctuate with degradation intensity, which we further leverage as an indicator for developing a sampling algorithm adaptive to input quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate InstantIR achieves state-of-the-art performance and offering outstanding visual quality. Through modulating generative references with textual description, InstantIR can restore extreme degradation and additionally feature creative restoration.</p></details> |  |

Despite the outstanding performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted the application of image restoration. To lift the restriction, it is required to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning approaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint. However, it fails to account for different computational complexities and performance requirements for different layers of an image restoration network. To further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the restoration accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method which outperforms previous pruning methods significantly.

However, existing LRMs often suffer from the hallucination dilemma, i.e., producing incorrect contents or textures when dealing with severe degradations, due to their heavy reliance on limited internal knowledge. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal solution called the Retrieval-augmented Framework for Image Restoration (ReFIR), which incorporates retrieved images as external knowledge to extend the knowledge boundary of existing LRMs in generating details faithful to the original scene. Specifically, we first introduce the nearest neighbor lookup to retrieve content-relevant high-quality images as reference, after which we propose the cross-image injection to modify existing LRMs to utilize high-quality textures from retrieved images. Thanks to the additional external knowledge, our ReFIR can well handle the hallucination challenge and facilitate faithfully results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFIR can achieve not only high-fidelity but also realistic restoration results. Importantly, our ReFIR requires no training and is adaptable to various LRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Learning Efficient and Effective Trajectories for Differential Equation-based Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04811v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The differential equation-based image restoration approach aims to establish learnable trajectories connecting high-quality images to a tractable distribution, e.g., low-quality images or a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the significant superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

| **[SITCOM: Step-wise Triple-Consistent Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04479v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative models that allow sampling from a distribution learned over a training set. When applied to solving inverse imaging problems (IPs), the reverse sampling steps of DMs are typically modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution in the image space. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (such as in the presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier sampling steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces the standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions, either implicitly or explicitly, our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our accelerated method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, under different levels of measurement noise, our extensive experiments across five linear and three non-linear image restoration tasks demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard image similarity metrics while requiring a significantly reduced run-time across all considered tasks.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we tackle a variety of vision tasks into a unified image-text-to-image generation framework and curate an Omni Pixel-to-Pixel Instruction-Tuning Dataset. By constructing detailed instruction templates in natural language, we comprehensively include a large set of diverse vision tasks such as text-to-image generation, image restoration, image grounding, dense image prediction, image editing, controllable generation, inpainting/outpainting, and more. Furthermore, we adopt Diffusion Transformers (DiT) as our foundation model and extend its capabilities with a flexible any resolution mechanism, enabling the model to dynamically process images based on the aspect ratio of the input, closely aligning with human perceptual processes. The model also incorporates structure-aware and semantic-aware guidance to facilitate effective fusion of information from the input image.

Leveraging a blend of attribute text prompts, high-quality reference images, and identity information, MGFR can mitigate the generation of false facial attributes and identities often associated with generative face restoration methods. By incorporating a dual-control adapter and a two-stage training strategy, our method effectively utilizes multi-modal prior information for targeted restoration tasks. We also present the Reface-HQ dataset, comprising over 23,000 high-resolution facial images across 5,000 identities, to address the need for reference face training images. Our approach achieves superior visual quality in restoring facial details under severe degradation and allows for controlled restoration processes, enhancing the accuracy of identity preservation and attribute correction. Including negative quality samples and attribute prompts in the training further refines the model's ability to generate detailed and perceptually accurate images.</p></details> | 23 Pages, 28 Figures |

We consider the setting where the rank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a priori and use an objective function built from a rank-overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground truth. We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the rank of the ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix rank, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when it is stopped appropriately. We then propose an efficient stopping strategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects a nearly optimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with deep image prior, which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 10 figures</p></details> |

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

| **[Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03463v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint. under review.

| **[Denoising as Adaptation: Noise-Space Domain Adaptation for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18516v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although learning-based image restoration methods have made significant progress, they still struggle with limited generalization to real-world scenarios due to the substantial domain gap caused by training on synthetic data. Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://kangliao929.github.io/projects/noise-da/</p></details> |

Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking. In this paper, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from technical details to applications. We highlight the major advancements in deep learning-based single-image shadow removal methods, thoroughly review previous research across various categories, and provide insights into the historical progression of these developments. Additionally, we summarize performance comparisons both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond the technical aspects of shadow removal methods, we also explore potential future directions for this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>url: ...</summary><p>url: https://github.com/GuoLanqing/Awesome-Shadow-Removal</p></details> |
| **[TransRef: Multi-Scale Reference Embedding Transformer for Reference-Guided Image Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11528v3)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image inpainting for completing complicated semantic environments and diverse hole patterns of corrupted images is challenging even for state-of-the-art learning-based inpainting methods trained on large-scale data. A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking and Defending Protective Perturbation in Personalized Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18944v4)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized diffusion models (PDMs) have become prominent for adapting pretrained text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects using minimal training data. However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted datasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective perturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification methods attempt to mitigate this issue but often over-purify images, resulting in information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a latent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP embedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate noisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor generalization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic defense framework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning. We first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images with their original semantic meanings in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of personalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers fundamental shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its superiority over existing purification methods and stronger robustness against adaptive perturbation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/liuyixin-louis/DiffShortcut</p></details> |
| **[Posterior sampling via Langevin dynamics based on generative priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02078v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Posterior sampling in high-dimensional spaces using generative models holds significant promise for various applications, including but not limited to inverse problems and guided generation tasks. Despite many recent developments, generating diverse posterior samples remains a challenge, as existing methods require restarting the entire generative process for each new sample, making the procedure computationally expensive. In this work, we propose efficient posterior sampling by simulating Langevin dynamics in the noise space of a pre-trained generative model. By exploiting the mapping between the noise and data spaces which can be provided by distilled flows or consistency models, our method enables seamless exploration of the posterior without the need to re-run the full sampling chain, drastically reducing computational overhead. Theoretically, we prove a guarantee for the proposed noise-space Langevin dynamics to approximate the posterior, assuming that the generative model sufficiently approximates the prior distribution. Our framework is experimentally validated on image restoration tasks involving noisy linear and nonlinear forward operators applied to LSUN-Bedroom (256 x 256) and ImageNet (64 x 64) datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach generates high-fidelity samples with enhanced semantic diversity even under a limited number of function evaluations, offering superior efficiency and performance compared to existing diffusion-based posterior sampling techniques.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this goal, current methods typically attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

Currently, CNN-transformer hybrid models provide state-of-the-art performance for these tasks. The key common ingredient in the architectural designs of these models is Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). We first show that CSA is an overall low-rank operation. Then, we propose an instance-Guided Low-rank Multi-Head selfattention (GLMHA) to replace the CSA for a considerable computational gain while closely retaining the original model performance. Unique to the proposed GLMHA is its ability to provide computational gain for both short and long input sequences. In particular, the gain is in terms of both Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and parameter count reduction. This is in contrast to the existing popular computational complexity reduction techniques, e.g., Linformer, Performer, and Reformer, for whom FLOPs overpower the efficient design tricks for the shorter input sequences. Moreover, parameter reduction remains unaccounted for in the existing methods.We perform an extensive evaluation for the tasks of spectral reconstruction from RGB images, spectral reconstruction from snapshot compressive imaging, motion deblurring, and image deraining by enhancing the best-performing models with our GLMHA. Our results show up to a 7.7 Giga FLOPs reduction with 370K fewer parameters required to closely retain the original performance of the best-performing models that employ CSA.</p></details> |  |

Despite performing effectively compared to single degradation restoration methods, they overlook the utilization of commonalities and specificities within multi-task restoration, thereby impeding the model's performance. Inspired by the success of deep generative models and fine-tuning techniques, we proposed a universal image restoration framework based on multiple low-rank adapters (LoRA) from multi-domain transfer learning. Our framework leverages the pre-trained generative model as the shared component for multi-degradation restoration and transfers it to specific degradation image restoration tasks using low-rank adaptation. Additionally, we introduce a LoRA composing strategy based on the degradation similarity, which adaptively combines trained LoRAs and enables our model to be applicable for mixed degradation restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple and mixed degradations demonstrate that the proposed universal image restoration method not only achieves higher fidelity and perceptual image quality but also has better generalization ability than other unified image restoration models.

However, these approaches often incur substantial memory requirements, particularly when processing ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. In this paper, we propose a novel image restoration method called MixNet, which introduces an alternative approach to global modeling approaches and is more effective for UHD image restoration. To capture the longrange dependency of features without introducing excessive computational complexity, we present the Global Feature Modulation Layer (GFML). GFML associates features from different views by permuting the feature maps, enabling efficient modeling of long-range dependency. In addition, we also design the Local Feature Modulation Layer (LFML) and Feed-forward Layer (FFL) to capture local features and transform features into a compact representation. This way, our MixNetachieves effective restoration with low inference time overhead and computational complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on four UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, underwater image enhancement, image deblurring and image demoireing, and the comprehensive results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a simple pipeline for all-in-one blind image restoration to Restore Anything with Masks (RAM). We focus on the image content by utilizing Mask Image Modeling to extract intrinsic image information rather than distinguishing degradation types like other methods. Our pipeline consists of two stages: masked image pre-training and fine-tuning with mask attribute conductance. We design a straightforward masking pre-training approach specifically tailored for all-in-one image restoration. This approach enhances networks to prioritize the extraction of image content priors from various degradations, resulting in a more balanced performance across different restoration tasks and achieving stronger overall results. To bridge the gap of input integrity while preserving learned image priors as much as possible, we selectively fine-tuned a small portion of the layers. Specifically, the importance of each layer is ranked by the proposed Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC), and the layers with higher contributions are selected for finetuning.

The Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) presents a promising alternative by starting the generative process from corrupted images and leveraging training techniques from score-based diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce the Implicit Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^3$SB) to further accelerate the generative process of I$^2$SB. I$^3$SB reconfigures the generative process into a non-Markovian framework by incorporating the initial corrupted image into each step, while ensuring that the marginal distribution aligns with that of I$^2$SB. This allows for the direct use of the pretrained network from I$^2$SB. Extensive experiments on natural images, human face images, and medical images validate the acceleration benefits of I$^3$SB.

However, modeling the degradations in the sRGB domain is complicated because of the Image Signal Processor (ISP) transformations. Despite of this known issue, very few methods in the literature work directly with sensor RAW images. In this work we tackle image restoration directly in the RAW domain. We design a new realistic degradation pipeline for training deep blind RAW restoration models. Our pipeline considers realistic sensor noise, motion blur, camera shake, and other common degradations. The models trained with our pipeline and data from multiple sensors, can successfully reduce noise and blur, and recover details in RAW images captured from different cameras.

However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

| **[OAPT: Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for Double JPEG Artifacts Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11480v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable performance in single JPEG artifacts removal task. However, existing methods tend to degrade on double JPEG images, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for double JPEG artifacts removal, termed as OAPT. We conduct an analysis of double JPEG compression that results in up to four patterns within each 8x8 block and design our model to cluster the similar patterns to remedy the difficulty of restoration. Our OAPT consists of two components: compression offset predictor and image reconstructor. Specifically, the predictor estimates pixel offsets between the first and second compression, which are then utilized to divide different patterns. The reconstructor is mainly based on several Hybrid Partition Attention Blocks (HPAB), combining vanilla window-based self-attention and sparse attention for clustered pattern features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OAPT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 0.16dB in double JPEG image restoration task. Moreover, without increasing any computation cost, the pattern clustering module in HPAB can serve as a plugin to enhance other transformer-based image restoration methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/QMoQ/OAPT.git .</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures.

Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases. In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation. This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks. We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively. Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement. Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design. We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond. The datasets, competition toolkit, workshop recordings, and source code from the winning teams are publicly available on the challenge website.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; 65 pages, 34 figures, 24 tables; Code at https://github.com/ldkong1205/RoboDepth</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight single-image super-resolution network based on dual paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06590v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The single image super-resolution(SISR) algorithms under deep learning currently have two main models, one based on convolutional neural networks and the other based on Transformer. The former uses the stacking of convolutional layers with different convolutional kernel sizes to design the model, which enables the model to better extract the local features of the image; the latter uses the self-attention mechanism to design the model, which allows the model to establish long-distance dependencies between image pixel points through the self-attention mechanism and then better extract the global features of the image. However, both of the above methods face their problems. Based on this, this paper proposes a new lightweight multi-scale feature fusion network model based on two-way complementary convolutional and Transformer, which integrates the respective features of Transformer and convolutional neural networks through a two-branch network architecture, to realize the mutual fusion of global and local information. Meanwhile, considering the partial loss of information caused by the low-pixel images trained by the deep neural network, this paper designs a modular connection method of multi-stage feature supplementation to fuse the feature maps extracted from the shallow stage of the model with those extracted from the deep stage of the model, to minimize the loss of the information in the feature images that is beneficial to the image restoration as much as possible, to facilitate the obtaining of a higher-quality restored image. The practical results finally show that the model proposed in this paper is optimal in image recovery performance when compared with other lightweight models with the same amount of parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perception-Distortion Balanced Super-Resolution: A Multi-Objective Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15408v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High perceptual quality and low distortion degree are two important goals in image restoration tasks such as super-resolution (SR). Most of the existing SR methods aim to achieve these goals by minimizing the corresponding yet conflicting losses, such as the $\ell_1$ loss and the adversarial loss. Unfortunately, the commonly used gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, are hard to balance these objectives due to the opposite gradient decent directions of the contradictory losses. In this paper, we formulate the perception-distortion trade-off in SR as a multi-objective optimization problem and develop a new optimizer by integrating the gradient-free evolutionary algorithm (EA) with gradient-based Adam, where EA and Adam focus on the divergence and convergence of the optimization directions respectively. As a result, a population of optimal models with different perception-distortion preferences is obtained. We then design a fusion network to merge these models into a single stronger one for an effective perception-distortion trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that with the same backbone network, the perception-distortion balanced SR model trained by our method can achieve better perceptual quality than its competitors while attaining better reconstruction fidelity.

| **[Graph Image Prior for Unsupervised Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15770v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can be a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The conclusion about reconstruction performance with the size of the latent variable is not stable, we must validate it before presenting it to other researchers</p></details> |

In recent years supervised learning approaches have become a popular strategy attempting to tackle this task. Unfortunately, most supervised learning-based methods are highly demanding in terms of computational resources and training data (sample complexity). In addition, trained models are sensitive to domain changes, such as varying acquisition systems, signal sampling rates, resolution and contrast. In this work, we try to answer a fundamental question: Can supervised learning models generalize well solely by learning from one image or even part of an image? If so, then what is the minimal amount of patches required to achieve acceptable generalization? To this end, we focus on an efficient patch-based learning framework that requires a single image input-output pair for training. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach for supervised image deblurring and super-resolution. Our results showcase significant improvement of learning models' sample efficiency, generalization and time complexity, that can hopefully be leveraged for future real-time applications, and applied to other signals and modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.14267</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally, the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly, while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784v2)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation to develop empirically effective algorithms for image restoration. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments over multiple datasets across several restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Diffusion Model for Image Restoration by Residual Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07319v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods have achieved remarkable success, they are still limited by the low inference speed attributed to the necessity of executing hundreds or even thousands of sampling steps. Existing acceleration sampling techniques, though seeking to expedite the process, inevitably sacrifice performance to some extent, resulting in over-blurry restored outcomes. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on three classical IR tasks, namely image super-resolution, image inpainting, and blind face restoration, \textit{\textbf{even only with four sampling steps}}.

| **[Variational Bayes image restoration with compressive autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17744v3)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling.Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, they often overlook the correlation between these channels, leading to color distortion and artifacts in the reconstructed image. To address this, we present Quaternion Nuclear Norm Minus Frobenius Norm Minimization (QNMF), a novel approach for color image reconstruction. QNMF utilizes quaternion algebra to capture the relationships among RGB channels comprehensively. By employing a regularization technique that involves nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm, QNMF approximates the underlying low-rank structure of quaternion-encoded color images. Theoretical proofs are provided to ensure the method's mathematical integrity. Demonstrating versatility and efficacy, the QNMF regularizer excels in various color low-level vision tasks, including denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and random impulse noise removal, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by Pattern Recognition on September 5, 2024</p></details> |
| **[In-Loop Filtering via Trained Look-Up Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10926v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology for removing the artifacts in image/video coding standards. Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Many end-to-end specialized models based on deep learning (DL) have been proposed, yet the scale and performance of these models are limited by the size of dataset. Given the superior parameter scales and feature representations of pre-trained models, they exhibit outstanding performance when transferred to downstream tasks with small datasets. Therefore, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method, namely PanAdapter, which utilizes additional advanced semantic information from pre-trained models to alleviate the issue of small-scale datasets in pansharpening tasks. Specifically, targeting the large domain discrepancy between image restoration and pansharpening tasks, the PanAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy for progressively adapting to the downstream task. In the first stage, we fine-tune the pre-trained CNN model and extract task-specific priors at two scales by proposed Local Prior Extraction (LPE) module. In the second stage, we feed the extracted two-scale priors into two branches of cascaded adapters respectively. At each adapter, we design two parameter-efficient modules for allowing the two branches to interact and be injected into the frozen pre-trained VisionTransformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that by only training the proposed LPE modules and adapters with a small number of parameters, our approach can benefit from pre-trained image restoration models and achieve state-of-the-art performance in several benchmark pansharpening datasets. The code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

However, in reality, multiple weather conditions always coexist and their degree of mixing is usually unknown. Under such complex and diverse weather conditions, single-weather restoration models struggle to meet practical demands. This is particularly critical in fields such as autonomous driving, where there is an urgent need for a model capable of effectively handling mixed weather conditions and enhancing image quality in an automated manner. In this paper, we propose a Task Sequence Generator module that, in conjunction with the Task Intra-patch Block, effectively extracts task-specific features embedded in degraded images. The Task Intra-patch Block introduces an external learnable sequence that aids the network in capturing task-specific information. Additionally, we employ a histogram-based transformer module as the backbone of our network, enabling the capture of both global and local dynamic range features.

Nevertheless, most of transformer-based models are strictly bounded by exorbitant memory occupancy. Our goal is to reduce the memory consumption of Swin Transformer and at the same time speed up the model during training process. Thus, we introduce AgileIR, group shifted attention mechanism along with window attention, which sparsely simplifies the model in architecture. We propose Group Shifted Window Attention (GSWA) to decompose Shift Window Multi-head Self Attention (SW-MSA) and Window Multi-head Self Attention (W-MSA) into groups across their attention heads, contributing to shrinking memory usage in back propagation. In addition to that, we keep shifted window masking and its shifted learnable biases during training, in order to induce the model interacting across windows within the channel. We also re-allocate projection parameters to accelerate attention matrix calculation, which we found a negligible decrease in performance. As a result of experiment, compared with our baseline SwinIR and other efficient quantization models, AgileIR keeps the performance still at 32.20 dB on Set5 evaluation dataset, exceeding other methods with tailor-made efficient methods and saves over 50% memory while a large batch size is employed.</p></details> |  |

PLAI is completed by accurately detecting the electrical components and defects in the aerial images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the visible quality of aerial images is inevitably degraded by adverse weather like haze, rain, or snow, which are found to drastically decrease the detection accuracy in our research. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new task of Power Line Aerial Image Restoration under Adverse Weather (PLAIR-AW), which aims to recover clean and high-quality images from degraded images with bad weather thus improving detection performance for PLAI. In this context, we are the first to release numerous corresponding datasets, namely, HazeCPLID, HazeTTPLA, HazeInsPLAD for power line aerial image dehazing, RainCPLID, RainTTPLA, RainInsPLAD for power line aerial image deraining, SnowCPLID, SnowInsPLAD for power line aerial image desnowing, which are synthesized upon the public power line aerial image datasets of CPLID, TTPLA, InsPLAD following the mathematical models. Meanwhile, we select numerous state-of-the-art methods from image restoration community as the baseline methods for PLAIR-AW. At last, we conduct large-scale empirical experiments to evaluate the performance of baseline methods on the proposed datasets.

| **[Empirical Bayesian image restoration by Langevin sampling with a denoising diffusion implicit prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04384v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion methods provide a powerful strategy to solve image restoration tasks by flexibly combining a pre-trained foundational prior model with a likelihood function specified during test time. Such methods are predominantly derived from two stochastic processes: reversing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, which underpins the celebrated denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM), and the Langevin diffusion process. The solutions delivered by DDPM and DDIM are often remarkably realistic, but they are not always consistent with measurements because of likelihood intractability issues and the associated required approximations. Alternatively, using a Langevin process circumvents the intractable likelihood issue, but usually leads to restoration results of inferior quality and longer computing times. This paper presents a novel and highly computationally efficient image restoration method that carefully embeds a foundational DDPM denoiser within an empirical Bayesian Langevin algorithm, which jointly calibrates key model hyper-parameters as it estimates the model's posterior mean. Extensive experimental results on three canonical tasks (image deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting) demonstrate that the proposed approach improves on state-of-the-art strategies both in image estimation accuracy and computing time.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Data-free distillation provides an alternative for allowing to learn a lightweight student model from a pre-trained teacher model without relying on the original training data. The existing data-free learning methods mainly optimize the models with the pseudo data generated by GANs or the real data collected from the Internet. However, they inevitably suffer from the problems of unstable training or domain shifts with the original data. In this paper, we propose a novel Data-free Distillation with Degradation-prompt Diffusion framework for multi-weather Image Restoration (D4IR). It replaces GANs with pre-trained diffusion models to avoid model collapse and incorporates a degradation-aware prompt adapter to facilitate content-driven conditional diffusion for generating domain-related images. Specifically, a contrast-based degradation prompt adapter is firstly designed to capture degradation-aware prompts from web-collected degraded images. Then, the collected unpaired clean images are perturbed to latent features of stable diffusion, and conditioned with the degradation-aware prompts to synthesize new domain-related degraded images for knowledge distillation. Experiments illustrate that our proposal achieves comparable performance to the model distilled with original training data, and is even superior to other mainstream unsupervised methods.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world weather conditions often consist of a mixture of several weather types, and the degree of weather mixing in autonomous driving scenarios remains unknown. In the presence of complex and diverse weather conditions, a single weather removal model often encounters challenges in producing clear images from severe weather images. Therefore, there is a need for the development of multi-task severe weather removal models that can effectively handle mixed weather conditions and improve image quality in autonomous driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-task severe weather removal model that can effectively handle complex weather conditions in an adaptive manner. Our model incorporates a weather task sequence generator, enabling the self-attention mechanism to selectively focus on features specific to different weather types. To tackle the challenge of repairing large areas of weather degradation, we introduce Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) to increase the receptive field. Additionally, we propose an adaptive upsampling technique that effectively processes both the weather task information and underlying image features by selectively retaining relevant information.

Conversely, using GAN or perceptual losses can produce sharp images with high perceptual metric scores (e.g., LPIPS), but may introduce artifacts and incorrect textures. Balancing these two types of losses can help achieve a trade-off between distortion and perception, but the challenge lies in tuning the loss function weights. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) into the training process of SISR models to balance perceptual quality and distortion. We conceptualize the relationship between loss weights and image quality assessment (IQA) metrics as black-box objective functions to be optimized within our Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization Super-Resolution (MOBOSR) framework. This approach automates the hyperparameter tuning process, reduces overall computational cost, and enables the use of numerous loss functions simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOBOSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both perceptual quality and distortion, significantly advancing the perception-distortion Pareto frontier. Our work points towards a new direction for future research on balancing perceptual quality and fidelity in nearly all image restoration tasks.

| **[F2former: When Fractional Fourier Meets Deep Wiener Deconvolution and Selective Frequency Transformer for Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02056v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in image deblurring techniques focuses mainly on operating in both frequency and spatial domains using the Fourier transform (FT) properties. However, their performance is limited due to the dependency of FT on stationary signals and its lack of capability to extract spatial-frequency properties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT), a unified spatial-frequency representation leveraging both spatial and frequency components simultaneously, making it ideal for processing non-stationary signals like images. Specifically, we introduce a Fractional Fourier Transformer (F2former), where we combine the classical fractional Fourier based Wiener deconvolution (F2WD) as well as a multi-branch encoder-decoder transformer based on a new fractional frequency aware transformer block (F2TB). We design F2TB consisting of a fractional frequency aware self-attention (F2SA) to estimate element-wise product attention based on important frequency components and a novel feed-forward network based on frequency division multiplexing (FM-FFN) to refine high and low frequency features separately for efficient latent clear image restoration. Experimental results for the cases of both motion deblurring as well as defocus deblurring show that the performance of our proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 21 figures |

By iterating over these prompts, Restorer can handle composite degradation in real-world scenarios without requiring additional training.Based on these designs, Restorer with one set of parameters demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to existing all-in-one and even single-task models.Additionally, Restorer is efficient during inference, suggesting the potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24060v3)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Few-Step Diffusion Models with Dense Reward Difference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11727v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning diffusion models with downstream objectives is essential for their practical applications. However, standard alignment methods often struggle with step generalization when directly applied to few-step diffusion models, leading to inconsistent performance across different denoising step scenarios. To address this, we introduce Stepwise Diffusion Policy Optimization (SDPO), a novel alignment method tailored for few-step diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a single sparse reward from only the final step of each denoising trajectory for trajectory-level optimization, SDPO incorporates dense reward feedback at every intermediate step. By learning the differences in dense rewards between paired samples, SDPO facilitates stepwise optimization of few-step diffusion models, ensuring consistent alignment across all denoising steps. To promote stable and efficient training, SDPO introduces an online reinforcement learning framework featuring several novel strategies designed to effectively exploit the stepwise granularity of dense rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that SDPO consistently outperforms prior methods in reward-based alignment across diverse step configurations, underscoring its robust step generalization capabilities.

However, these methods suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions. The weatherrobust 4D radar provides Doppler and additional geometric information, raising the possibility of addressing this challenge. To this end, we present V2X-R, the first simulated V2X dataset incorporating LiDAR, camera, and 4D radar. V2X-R contains 12,079 scenarios with 37,727 frames of LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds, 150,908 images, and 170,859 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline for 3D object detection and implement it with various fusion strategies. To achieve weather-robust detection, we additionally propose a Multi-modal Denoising Diffusion (MDD) module in our fusion pipeline. MDD utilizes weather-robust 4D radar feature as a condition to prompt the diffusion model to denoise noisy LiDAR features. Experiments show that our LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline demonstrates superior performance in the V2X-R dataset. Over and above this, our MDD module further improved the performance of basic fusion model by up to 5.73%/6.70% in foggy/snowy conditions with barely disrupting normal performance. The dataset and code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/ylwhxht/V2X-R.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Reinforcement Learning under Diffusion Models for Data with Jumps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11697v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven effective in solving complex decision-making tasks across various domains, but challenges remain in continuous-time settings, particularly when state dynamics are governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with jump components. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing the Mean-Square Bipower Variation Error (MSBVE) algorithm, which enhances robustness and convergence in scenarios involving significant stochastic noise and jumps. We first revisit the Mean-Square TD Error (MSTDE) algorithm, commonly used in continuous-time RL, and highlight its limitations in handling jumps in state dynamics. The proposed MSBVE algorithm minimizes the mean-square quadratic variation error, offering improved performance over MSTDE in environments characterized by SDEs with jumps. Simulations and formal proofs demonstrate that the MSBVE algorithm reliably estimates the value function in complex settings, surpassing MSTDE's performance when faced with jump processes. These findings underscore the importance of alternative error metrics to improve the resilience and effectiveness of RL algorithms in continuous-time frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conceptwm: A Diffusion Model Watermark for Concept Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11688v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The personalization techniques of diffusion models succeed in generating specific concepts but also pose threats to copyright protection and illegal use. Model Watermarking is an effective method to prevent the unauthorized use of subject-driven or style-driven image generation, safeguarding concept copyrights. However, under the goal of concept-oriented protection, current watermarking schemes typically add watermarks to all images rather than applying them in a refined manner targeted at specific concepts. Additionally, the personalization techniques of diffusion models can easily remove watermarks. Existing watermarking methods struggle to achieve fine-grained watermark embedding with a few images of specific concept and prevent removal of watermarks through personalized fine-tuning. Therefore, we introduce a novel concept-oriented watermarking framework that seamlessly embeds imperceptible watermarks into the concept of diffusion models. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify our framework. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Conceptwm-4EB3/.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces TSIS (Simplified TSID) and its variants:TSISD (TSIS with Depth-First Search), TSISO (TSIS in Order), and TSISR (TSIS in Random), as integral components of the t-SMILES framework. These additions complete the framework's design, providing diverse approaches to molecular representation. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments employing deep generative models, including GPT, diffusion models, and reinforcement learning, the findings reveal that the hierarchical structure of t-SMILES is more straightforward to parse than initially anticipated. Furthermore, t-SMILES consistently outperforms other linear representations such as SMILES, SELFIES, and SAFE, demonstrating superior convergence speed and enhanced generalization capabilities.</p></details> | 26pages, 6 figures |

To alleviate artifacts and improve quality of synthetic images, we fine-tune Vision-Language Model (VLM) as artifact classifier to automatically identify and classify a wide range of artifacts and provide supervision for further optimizing generative models. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive artifact taxonomy and construct a dataset of synthetic images with artifact annotations for fine-tuning VLM, named SynArtifact-1K. The fine-tuned VLM exhibits superior ability of identifying artifacts and outperforms the baseline by 25.66%. To our knowledge, this is the first time such end-to-end artifact classification task and solution have been proposed. Finally, we leverage the output of VLM as feedback to refine the generative model for alleviating artifacts. Visualization results and user study demonstrate that the quality of images synthesized by the refined diffusion model has been obviously improved.</p></details> |  |
| **[MagicStick: Controllable Video Editing via Control Handle Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03047v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based video editing has recently attracted considerable interest in changing the style or replacing the objects with a similar structure. Beyond this, we demonstrate that properties such as shape, size, location, motion, etc., can also be edited in videos. Our key insight is that the keyframe transformations of the specific internal feature (e.g., edge maps of objects or human pose), can easily propagate to other frames to provide generation guidance. We thus propose MagicStick, a controllable video editing method that edits the video properties by utilizing the transformation on the extracted internal control signals. In detail, to keep the appearance, we inflate both the pretrained image diffusion model and ControlNet to the temporal dimension and train low-rank adaptions (LORA) layers to fit the specific scenes. Then, in editing, we perform an inversion and editing framework. Differently, finetuned ControlNet is introduced in both inversion and generation for attention guidance with the proposed attention remix between the spatial attention maps of inversion and editing. Yet succinct, our method is the first method to show the ability of video property editing from the pre-trained text-to-image model. We present experiments on numerous examples within our unified framework. We also compare with shape-aware text-based editing and handcrafted motion video generation, demonstrating our superior temporal consistency and editing capability than previous works. The code and models are available on https://github.com/mayuelala/MagicStick.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025, Project page: https://magic-stick-edit.github.io/ Github repository: https://github.com/mayuelala/MagicStick</p></details> |
| **[Straightness of Rectified Flow: A Theoretical Insight into Wasserstein Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14949v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for image generation and denoising. Typically, generative models learn a trajectory between the starting noise distribution and the target data distribution. Recently Liu et al. (2023b) designed a novel alternative generative model Rectified Flow (RF), which aims to learn straight flow trajectories from noise to data using a sequence of convex optimization problems with close ties to optimal transport. If the trajectory is curved, one must use many Euler discretization steps or novel strategies, such as exponential integrators, to achieve a satisfactory generation quality. In contrast, RF has been shown to theoretically straighten the trajectory through successive rectifications, reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) while sampling. It has also been shown empirically that RF may improve the straightness in two rectifications if one can solve the underlying optimization problem within a sufficiently small error. In this paper, we make two key theoretical contributions: 1) we provide the first theoretical analysis of the Wasserstein distance between the sampling distribution of RF and the target distribution. Our error rate is characterized by the number of discretization steps and a new formulation of straightness stronger than that in the original work. 2) under a mild regularity assumption, we show that for a rectified flow from a Gaussian to any general target distribution with finite first moment (e.g. mixture of Gaussians), two rectifications are sufficient to achieve a straight flow, which is in line with the previous empirical findings. Additionally, we also present empirical results on both simulated and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEFT: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models by Learning the Generalised $h$-transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01781v3)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modelling paradigms based on denoising diffusion processes have emerged as a leading candidate for conditional sampling in inverse problems. In many real-world applications, we often have access to large, expensively trained unconditional diffusion models, which we aim to exploit for improving conditional sampling. Most recent approaches are motivated heuristically and lack a unifying framework, obscuring connections between them. Further, they often suffer from issues such as being very sensitive to hyperparameters, being expensive to train or needing access to weights hidden behind a closed API. In this work, we unify conditional training and sampling using the mathematically well-understood Doob's h-transform. This new perspective allows us to unify many existing methods under a common umbrella. Under this framework, we propose DEFT (Doob's h-transform Efficient FineTuning), a new approach for conditional generation that simply fine-tunes a very small network to quickly learn the conditional $h$-transform, while keeping the larger unconditional network unchanged. DEFT is much faster than existing baselines while achieving state-of-the-art performance across a variety of linear and non-linear benchmarks. On image reconstruction tasks, we achieve speedups of up to 1.6$\times$, while having the best perceptual quality on natural images and reconstruction performance on medical images. Further, we also provide initial experiments on protein motif scaffolding and outperform reconstruction guidance methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.09236</p></details> |
| **[Unpicking Data at the Seams: VAEs, Disentanglement and Independent Components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22559v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disentanglement, or identifying salient statistically independent factors of the data, is of interest in many areas of machine learning and statistics, with relevance to synthetic data generation with controlled properties, robust classification of features, parsimonious encoding, and a greater understanding of the generative process underlying the data. Disentanglement arises in several generative paradigms, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Particular progress has recently been made in understanding disentanglement in VAEs, where the choice of diagonal posterior covariance matrices is suggested to promote mutual orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. We continue this thread to show how this linear independence translates to statistical independence, completing the chain in understanding how the VAE's objective identifies independent components of, or disentangles, the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cascaded Diffusion Models for 2D and 3D Microscopy Image Synthesis to Enhance Cell Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11515v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated cell segmentation in microscopy images is essential for biomedical research, yet conventional methods are labor-intensive and prone to error. While deep learning-based approaches have proven effective, they often require large annotated datasets, which are scarce due to the challenges of manual annotation. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing densely annotated 2D and 3D cell microscopy images using cascaded diffusion models. Our method synthesizes 2D and 3D cell masks from sparse 2D annotations using multi-level diffusion models and NeuS, a 3D surface reconstruction approach. Following that, a pretrained 2D Stable Diffusion model is finetuned to generate realistic cell textures and the final outputs are combined to form cell populations. We show that training a segmentation model with a combination of our synthetic data and real data improves cell segmentation performance by up to 9\% across multiple datasets. Additionally, the FID scores indicate that the synthetic data closely resembles real data. The code for our proposed approach will be available at https://github.com/ruveydayilmaz0/cascaded\_diffusion.</p></details> |  |

However, a key challenge remains in effectively decoupling light-independent and lighting-dependent components to enhance the quality of generated 3D models and their relighting performance. In this paper, we present MVLight, a novel light-conditioned multi-view diffusion model that explicitly integrates lighting conditions directly into the generation process. This enables the model to synthesize high-quality images that faithfully reflect the specified lighting environment across multiple camera views. By leveraging this capability to Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), we can effectively synthesize 3D models with improved geometric precision and relighting capabilities. We validate the effectiveness of MVLight through extensive experiments and a user study.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLUE-MARK: Watermarking Diffusion Models using CLWE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11434v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI-generated images become widespread, reliable watermarking is essential for content verification, copyright enforcement, and combating disinformation. Existing techniques rely on heuristic approaches and lack formal guarantees of undetectability, making them vulnerable to steganographic attacks that can expose or erase the watermark. Additionally, these techniques often degrade output quality by introducing perceptible changes, which is not only undesirable but an important barrier to adoption in practice. In this work, we introduce CLUE-Mark, the first provably undetectable watermarking scheme for diffusion models. CLUE-Mark requires no changes to the model being watermarked, is computationally efficient, and because it is provably undetectable is guaranteed to have no impact on model output quality. Our approach leverages the Continuous Learning With Errors (CLWE) problem -- a cryptographically hard lattice problem -- to embed watermarks in the latent noise vectors used by diffusion models. By proving undetectability via reduction to a cryptographically hard problem we ensure not only that the watermark is imperceptible to human observers or adhoc heuristics, but to \emph{any} efficient detector that does not have the secret key. CLUE-Mark allows multiple keys to be embedded, enabling traceability of images to specific users without altering model parameters. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art diffusion models confirm that CLUE-Mark achieves high recoverability, preserves image quality, and is robust to minor perturbations such JPEG compression and brightness adjustments. Uniquely, CLUE-Mark cannot be detected nor removed by recent steganographic attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArtWeaver: Advanced Dynamic Style Integration via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15287v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stylized Text-to-Image Generation (STIG) aims to generate images from text prompts and style reference images. In this paper, we present ArtWeaver, a novel framework that leverages pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) to address challenges such as misinterpreted styles and inconsistent semantics. Our approach introduces two innovative modules: the mixed style descriptor and the dynamic attention adapter. The mixed style descriptor enhances SD by combining content-aware and frequency-disentangled embeddings from CLIP with additional sources that capture global statistics and textual information, thus providing a richer blend of style-related and semantic-related knowledge. To achieve a better balance between adapter capacity and semantic control, the dynamic attention adapter is integrated into the diffusion UNet, dynamically calculating adaptation weights based on the style descriptors. Additionally, we introduce two objective functions to optimize the model alongside the denoising loss, further enhancing semantic and style consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ArtWeaver over existing methods, producing images with diverse target styles while maintaining the semantic integrity of the text prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frame Interpolation with Consecutive Brownian Bridge Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05953v6)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) tries to formulate VFI as a diffusion-based conditional image generation problem, synthesizing the intermediate frame given a random noise and neighboring frames. Due to the relatively high resolution of videos, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are employed as the conditional generation model, where the autoencoder compresses images into latent representations for diffusion and then reconstructs images from these latent representations. Such a formulation poses a crucial challenge: VFI expects that the output is deterministically equal to the ground truth intermediate frame, but LDMs randomly generate a diverse set of different images when the model runs multiple times. The reason for the diverse generation is that the cumulative variance (variance accumulated at each step of generation) of generated latent representations in LDMs is large. This makes the sampling trajectory random, resulting in diverse rather than deterministic generations. To address this problem, we propose our unique solution: Frame Interpolation with Consecutive Brownian Bridge Diffusion. Specifically, we propose consecutive Brownian Bridge diffusion that takes a deterministic initial value as input, resulting in a much smaller cumulative variance of generated latent representations. Our experiments suggest that our method can improve together with the improvement of the autoencoder and achieve state-of-the-art performance in VFI, leaving strong potential for further enhancement.</p></details> | Formatting |
| **[Teaching Video Diffusion Model with Latent Physical Phenomenon Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11343v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models have exhibited tremendous progress in various video generation tasks. However, existing models struggle to capture latent physical knowledge, failing to infer physical phenomena that are challenging to articulate with natural language. Generating videos following the fundamental physical laws is still an opening challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method to teach video diffusion models with latent physical phenomenon knowledge, enabling the accurate generation of physically informed phenomena. Specifically, we first pretrain Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to reconstruct the physical phenomena, resulting in output embeddings that encapsulate latent physical phenomenon knowledge. Leveraging these embeddings, we could generate the pseudo-language prompt features based on the aligned spatial relationships between CLIP vision and language encoders. Particularly, given that diffusion models typically use CLIP's language encoder for text prompt embeddings, our approach integrates the CLIP visual features informed by latent physical knowledge into a quaternion hidden space. This enables the modeling of spatial relationships to produce physical knowledge-informed pseudo-language prompts. By incorporating these prompt features and fine-tuning the video diffusion model in a parameter-efficient manner, the physical knowledge-informed videos are successfully generated. We validate our method extensively through both numerical simulations and real-world observations of physical phenomena, demonstrating its remarkable performance across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | 7 figures, 14 pages |

This paper introduces MegaFusion, a novel approach that extends existing diffusion-based text-to-image models towards efficient higher-resolution generation without additional fine-tuning or adaptation. Specifically, we employ an innovative truncate and relay strategy to bridge the denoising processes across different resolutions, allowing for high-resolution image generation in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, by integrating dilated convolutions and noise re-scheduling, we further adapt the model's priors for higher resolution. The versatility and efficacy of MegaFusion make it universally applicable to both latent-space and pixel-space diffusion models, along with other derivative models. Extensive experiments confirm that MegaFusion significantly boosts the capability of existing models to produce images of megapixels and various aspect ratios, while only requiring about 40% of the original computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025.

| **[Vision-guided and Mask-enhanced Adaptive Denoising for Prompt-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10496v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality images from text prompts, which boosts researches on prompt-based image editing that edits a source image according to a target prompt. Despite their advances, existing methods still encounter three key issues: 1) limited capacity of the text prompt in guiding target image generation, 2) insufficient mining of word-to-patch and patch-to-patch relationships for grounding editing areas, and 3) unified editing strength for all regions during each denoising step. To address these issues, we present a Vision-guided and Mask-enhanced Adaptive Editing (ViMAEdit) method with three key novel designs. First, we propose to leverage image embeddings as explicit guidance to enhance the conventional textual prompt-based denoising process, where a CLIP-based target image embedding estimation strategy is introduced. Second, we devise a self-attention-guided iterative editing area grounding strategy, which iteratively exploits patch-to-patch relationships conveyed by self-attention maps to refine those word-to-patch relationships contained in cross-attention maps. Last, we present a spatially adaptive variance-guided sampling, which highlights sampling variances for critical image regions to promote the editing capability. Experimental results demonstrate the superior editing capacity of ViMAEdit over all existing methods.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, humans are difficult to be cheated by subtle manipulations, since we make judgments only based on essential factors. Inspired by this observation, we attempt to model label generation with essential label-causative factors and incorporate label-non-causative factors to assist data generation. For an adversarial example, we aim to discriminate the perturbations as non-causative factors and make predictions only based on the label-causative factors. Concretely, we propose a casual diffusion model (CausalDiff) that adapts diffusion models for conditional data generation and disentangles the two types of casual factors by learning towards a novel casual information bottleneck objective. Empirically, CausalDiff has significantly outperformed state-of-the-art defense methods on various unseen attacks, achieving an average robustness of 86.39% (+4.01%) on CIFAR-10, 56.25% (+3.13%) on CIFAR-100, and 82.62% (+4.93%) on GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark).

| **[ControlNet++: Improving Conditional Controls with Efficient Consistency Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07987v3)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, existing efforts like ControlNet incorporated image-based conditional controls. In this paper, we reveal that existing methods still face significant challenges in generating images that align with the image conditional controls. To this end, we propose ControlNet++, a novel approach that improves controllable generation by explicitly optimizing pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images and conditional controls. Specifically, for an input conditional control, we use a pre-trained discriminative reward model to extract the corresponding condition of the generated images, and then optimize the consistency loss between the input conditional control and extracted condition. A straightforward implementation would be generating images from random noises and then calculating the consistency loss, but such an approach requires storing gradients for multiple sampling timesteps, leading to considerable time and memory costs. To address this, we introduce an efficient reward strategy that deliberately disturbs the input images by adding noise, and then uses the single-step denoised images for reward fine-tuning. This avoids the extensive costs associated with image sampling, allowing for more efficient reward fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that ControlNet++ significantly improves controllability under various conditional controls. For example, it achieves improvements over ControlNet by 11.1% mIoU, 13.4% SSIM, and 7.6% RMSE, respectively, for segmentation mask, line-art edge, and depth conditions.

| **[Stealing Training Graphs from Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11197v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in modeling graphs in various tasks. The training of GNNs, especially on specialized tasks such as bioinformatics, demands extensive expert annotations, which are expensive and usually contain sensitive information of data providers. The trained GNN models are often shared for deployment in the real world. As neural networks can memorize the training samples, the model parameters of GNNs have a high risk of leaking private training data. Our theoretical analysis shows the strong connections between trained GNN parameters and the training graphs used, confirming the training graph leakage issue. However, explorations into training data leakage from trained GNNs are rather limited. Therefore, we investigate a novel problem of stealing graphs from trained GNNs. To obtain high-quality graphs that resemble the target training set, a graph diffusion model with diffusion noise optimization is deployed as a graph generator. Furthermore, we propose a selection method that effectively leverages GNN model parameters to identify training graphs from samples generated by the graph diffusion model. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in stealing training graphs from the trained GNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be appeared in KDD 2025</p></details> |

Spleen length measured from 2D ultrasound is the most widely used metric for characterising spleen size. However, it is still considered a surrogate measure, and spleen volume remains the gold standard for assessing spleen size. Accurate spleen volume measurement typically requires 3D imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, but these are not widely available, especially in the Global South which has a high prevalence of SCD. In this work, we introduce a deep learning pipeline, DeepSPV, for precise spleen volume estimation from single or dual 2D ultrasound images. The pipeline involves a segmentation network and a variational autoencoder for learning low-dimensional representations from the estimated segmentations. We investigate three approaches for spleen volume estimation and our best model achieves 86.62%/92.5% mean relative volume accuracy (MRVA) under single-view/dual-view settings, surpassing the performance of human experts. In addition, the pipeline can provide confidence intervals for the volume estimates as well as offering benefits in terms of interpretability, which further support clinicians in decision-making when identifying splenomegaly. We evaluate the full pipeline using a highly realistic synthetic dataset generated by a diffusion model, achieving an overall MRVA of 83.0% from a single 2D ultrasound image. Our proposed DeepSPV is the first work to use deep learning to estimate 3D spleen volume from 2D ultrasound images and can be seamlessly integrated into the current clinical workflow for spleen assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2308.08038</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion-Inspired Quantum Noise Mitigation in Parameterized Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00843v2)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) have been acknowledged as a leading strategy to utilize near-term quantum advantages in multiple problems, including machine learning and combinatorial optimization. When applied to specific tasks, the parameters in the quantum circuits are trained to minimize the target function. Although there have been comprehensive studies to improve the performance of the PQCs on practical tasks, the errors caused by the quantum noise downgrade the performance when running on real quantum computers. In particular, when the quantum state is transformed through multiple quantum circuit layers, the effect of the quantum noise happens cumulatively and becomes closer to the maximally mixed state or complete noise. This paper studies the relationship between the quantum noise and the diffusion model. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired learning approach to mitigate the quantum noise in the PQCs and reduce the error for specific tasks. Through our experiments, we illustrate the efficiency of the learning strategy and achieve state-of-the-art performance on classification tasks in the quantum noise scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By employing a fixed-point-inspired iterative approach to invert real-world images, we observe that the solution does not achieve convergence, instead oscillating between distinct clusters. Through both toy experiments and real-world diffusion models, we demonstrate that these oscillating clusters exhibit notable semantic coherence. We offer theoretical insights, showing that this behavior arises from oscillatory dynamics in rectified flow models. Building on this understanding, we introduce a simple and fast distribution transfer technique that facilitates image enhancement, stroke-based recoloring, as well as visual prompt-guided image editing. Furthermore, we provide quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for tasks such as image enhancement, makeup transfer, reconstruction quality, and guided sampling quality.

To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called frequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the TSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when transitioning from a traditionally static procurement method to a dynamic strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area in Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency development. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess changes in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary service product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance probabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the model. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential to significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to 37%) while keeping the total yearly procured FCR volume the same as compared to the current static approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |

This paper introduces Diffusion-Driven Diagnosis (D-Cube), a novel approach that leverages hyper-features from a diffusion model combined with contrastive learning to improve cancer diagnosis. D-Cube employs advanced feature selection techniques that utilize the robust representational capabilities of diffusion models, enhancing classification performance on medical datasets under challenging conditions such as data imbalance and limited sample availability. The feature selection process optimizes the extraction of clinically relevant features, significantly improving classification accuracy and demonstrating resilience in imbalanced and limited data scenarios. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of D-Cube across multiple medical imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, and X-ray, showing superior performance compared to existing baseline models. D-Cube represents a new strategy in cancer detection, employing advanced deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Stimulating Diffusion Model for Image Denoising via Adaptive Embedding and Ensembling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03992v5)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computational photography, where achieving high perception with low distortion is highly demanding. Current methods either struggle with perceptual quality or suffer from significant distortion. Recently, the emerging diffusion model has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks and demonstrates great potential for image denoising. However, stimulating diffusion models for image denoising is not straightforward and requires solving several critical problems. For one thing, the input inconsistency hinders the connection between diffusion models and image denoising. For another, the content inconsistency between the generated image and the desired denoised image introduces distortion. To tackle these problems, we present a novel strategy called the Diffusion Model for Image Denoising (DMID) by understanding and rethinking the diffusion model from a denoising perspective. Our DMID strategy includes an adaptive embedding method that embeds the noisy image into a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and an adaptive ensembling method that reduces distortion in the denoised image. Our DMID strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance on both distortion-based and perception-based metrics, for both Gaussian and real-world image denoising.The code is available at https://github.com/Li-Tong-621/DMID.</p></details> | 18 pages,15 figures |

Among them, Diffusion Models have led to a remarkable improvement in the quality of image generation, making it vary challenging to distinguish between real and synthesized images. It simultaneously raises serious concerns regarding privacy and security. Some methods are proposed to distinguish the diffusion model generated images through reconstructing. However, the inversion and denoising processes are time-consuming and heavily reliant on the pre-trained generative model. Consequently, if the pre-trained generative model meet the problem of out-of-domain, the detection performance declines. To address this issue, we propose a universal synthetic image detector Time Step Generating (TSG), which does not rely on pre-trained models' reconstructing ability, specific datasets, or sampling algorithms. Our method utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model's network as a feature extractor to capture fine-grained details, focusing on the subtle differences between real and synthetic images. By controlling the time step t of the network input, we can effectively extract these distinguishing detail features. Then, those features can be passed through a classifier (i.e. Resnet), which efficiently detects whether an image is synthetic or real. We test the proposed TSG on the large-scale GenImage benchmark and it achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025, 9 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

We unify tasks such as depth estimation, optical flow, and amodal segmentation under the framework of image-to-image translation, and show how diffusion models benefit from scaling training and test-time compute for these perceptual tasks. Through a careful analysis of these scaling properties, we formulate compute-optimal training and inference recipes to scale diffusion models for visual perception tasks. Our models achieve competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods using significantly less data and compute.

In contrast, we introduce a novel framework to directly generate explicit surface geometry and texture using multi-view 2D depth and RGB images along with 3D Gaussian features using a repurposed Stable Diffusion model. We introduce a depth branch into U-Net for efficient and high quality multi-view, cross-domain generation and incorporate epipolar attention into the latent-to-pixel decoder for pixel-level multi-view consistency. By back-projecting the generated depth pixels into 3D space, we create a structured 3D representation that can be either rendered via Gaussian splatting or extracted to high-quality meshes, thereby leveraging additional novel view synthesis loss to further improve our performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing baselines in geometry and texture quality while achieving significantly faster generation time.</p></details> | <details><summary>3DV 2...</summary><p>3DV 2025, Project page: https://hao-yu-wu.github.io/gen3d/</p></details> |

Camera-LiDAR data fusion compensate for deficiencies of stand-alone sensors but relies on precise extrinsic calibration. Many learning-based calibration methods predict extrinsic parameters in a single step. Driven by the growing demand for higher accuracy, a few approaches utilize multi-range models or integrate multiple methods to improve extrinsic parameter predictions, but these strategies incur extended training times and require additional storage for separate models. To address these issues, we propose a single-model iterative approach based on surrogate diffusion to significantly enhance the capacity of individual calibration methods. By applying a buffering technique proposed by us, the inference time of our surrogate diffusion is 43.7% less than that of multi-range models. Additionally, we create a calibration network as our denoiser, featuring both projection-first and encoding-first branches for effective point feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our diffusion model outperforms other single-model iterative methods and delivers competitive results compared to multi-range models. Our denoiser exceeds state-of-the-art calibration methods, reducing the rotation error by 24.5% compared to the second-best method. Furthermore, with the proposed diffusion applied, it achieves 20.4% less rotation error and 9.6% less translation error.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Diffusion with Trust Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10932v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated significant promise in various generative tasks; however, they often struggle to satisfy challenging constraints. Our approach addresses this limitation by rethinking training-free loss-guided diffusion from an optimization perspective. We formulate a series of constrained optimizations throughout the inference process of a diffusion model. In each optimization, we allow the sample to take multiple steps along the gradient of the proxy constraint function until we can no longer trust the proxy, according to the variance at each diffusion level. Additionally, we estimate the state manifold of diffusion model to allow for early termination when the sample starts to wander away from the state manifold at each diffusion step. Trust sampling effectively balances between following the unconditional diffusion model and adhering to the loss guidance, enabling more flexible and accurate constrained generation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments on complex tasks, and in drastically different domains of images and 3D motion generation, showing significant improvements over existing methods in terms of generation quality.

Controllability can be improved by introducing layout conditioning, however existing methods lack layout editing ability and fine-grained control over object attributes. The concept of multi-layer generation holds great potential to address these limitations, however generating image instances concurrently to scene composition limits control over fine-grained object attributes, relative positioning in 3D space and scene manipulation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel multi-stage generation paradigm that is designed for fine-grained control, flexibility and interactivity. To ensure control over instance attributes, we devise a novel training paradigm to adapt a diffusion model to generate isolated scene components as RGBA images with transparency information. To build complex images, we employ these pre-generated instances and introduce a multi-layer composite generation process that smoothly assembles components in realistic scenes. Our experiments show that our RGBA diffusion model is capable of generating diverse and high quality instances with precise control over object attributes. Through multi-layer composition, we demonstrate that our approach allows to build and manipulate images from highly complex prompts with fine-grained control over object appearance and location, granting a higher degree of control than competing methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Model distillation is one of the most effective directions to accelerate these models. However, previous distillation methods fail to retain the generation quality while requiring a significant amount of images for training, either from real data or synthetically generated by the teacher model. In response to this limitation, we present a novel image-free distillation scheme named $\textbf{SwiftBrush}$. Drawing inspiration from text-to-3D synthesis, in which a 3D neural radiance field that aligns with the input prompt can be obtained from a 2D text-to-image diffusion prior via a specialized loss without the use of any 3D data ground-truth, our approach re-purposes that same loss for distilling a pretrained multi-step text-to-image model to a student network that can generate high-fidelity images with just a single inference step. In spite of its simplicity, our model stands as one of the first one-step text-to-image generators that can produce images of comparable quality to Stable Diffusion without reliance on any training image data. Remarkably, SwiftBrush achieves an FID score of $\textbf{16.67}$ and a CLIP score of $\textbf{0.29}$ on the COCO-30K benchmark, achieving competitive results or even substantially surpassing existing state-of-the-art distillation techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024; Github: https://github.com/VinAIResearch/SwiftBrush</p></details> |

However, a major challenge in FER task is the class imbalance commonly found in available datasets, which can hinder both model performance and generalization. In this paper, we tackle the issue of data imbalance by incorporating synthetic data augmentation and leveraging the ResEmoteNet model to enhance the overall performance on facial emotion recognition task. We employed Stable Diffusion 2 and Stable Diffusion 3 Medium models to generate synthetic facial emotion data, augmenting the training sets of the FER2013 and RAF-DB benchmark datasets.

While traditional animation requires teams of skilled artists to draw key frames and in-between frames, existing automation attempts still demand significant artistic effort through precise motion paths or keyframe specification. We present FlipSketch, a system that brings back the magic of flip-book animation -- just draw your idea and describe how you want it to move! Our approach harnesses motion priors from text-to-video diffusion models, adapting them to generate sketch animations through three key innovations: (i) fine-tuning for sketch-style frame generation, (ii) a reference frame mechanism that preserves visual integrity of input sketch through noise refinement, and (iii) a dual-attention composition that enables fluid motion without losing visual consistency. Unlike constrained vector animations, our raster frames support dynamic sketch transformations, capturing the expressive freedom of traditional animation. The result is an intuitive system that makes sketch animation as simple as doodling and describing, while maintaining the artistic essence of hand-drawn animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/hmrishavbandy/FlipSketch</p></details> |

Within this problem setting, a pivotal challenge revolves around \textit{catastrophic forgetting} issue, wherein the agent is prone to effortlessly erode the decisional knowledge associated with past encountered tasks when learning the new one. In recent progresses, the \textit{generative replay} methods have showcased substantial potential by employing generative models to replay data distribution of past tasks. Compared to storing the data from past tasks directly, this category of methods circumvents the growing storage overhead and possible data privacy concerns. However, constrained by the expressive capacity of generative models, existing \textit{generative replay} methods face challenges in faithfully reconstructing the data distribution of past tasks, particularly in scenarios with a myriad of tasks or high-dimensional data. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in various generative tasks, this paper introduces a novel continual RL algorithm DISTR (Diffusion-based Trajectory Replay) that employs a diffusion model to memorize the high-return trajectory distribution of each encountered task and wakeups these distributions during the policy learning on new tasks. Besides, considering the impracticality of replaying all past data each time, a prioritization mechanism is proposed to prioritize the trajectory replay of pivotal tasks in our method. Empirical experiments on the popular continual RL benchmark \texttt{Continual World} demonstrate that our proposed method obtains a favorable balance between \textit{stability} and \textit{plasticity}, surpassing various existing continual RL baselines in average success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, inclusion at ICLR 2024 Workshop on Generative Models for Decision Making</p></details> |

Most recent works need to either finetune specific parts of the base diffusion model or introduce new trainable parameters, leading to deployment inflexibility due to the need for training. To address this gap in the current literature, we propose our method called TINTIN: Test-time Conditional Text-to-Image Synthesis using Diffusion Models which is a new training-free test-time only algorithm to condition text-to-image diffusion model outputs on conditioning factors such as color palettes and edge maps. In particular, we propose to interpret noise predictions during denoising as gradients of an energy-based model, leading to a flexible approach to manipulate the noise by matching predictions inferred from them to the ground truth conditioning input. This results in, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to control model outputs with input color palettes, which we realize using a novel color distribution matching loss. We also show this test-time noise manipulation can be easily extensible to other types of conditioning, e.g., edge maps. We conduct extensive experiments using a variety of text prompts, color palettes, and edge maps and demonstrate significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |

SAR-to-EO (Electro-Optical) image translation (SET) has emerged to make SAR images more perceptually interpretable. However, traditional approaches trained from scratch on limited SAR-EO datasets are prone to overfitting. To address these challenges, we introduce Confidence Diffusion for SAR-to-EO Translation, called C-DiffSET, a framework leveraging pretrained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) extensively trained on natural images, thus enabling effective adaptation to the EO domain. Remarkably, we find that the pretrained VAE encoder aligns SAR and EO images in the same latent space, even with varying noise levels in SAR inputs. To further improve pixel-wise fidelity for SET, we propose a confidence-guided diffusion (C-Diff) loss that mitigates artifacts from temporal discrepancies, such as appearing or disappearing objects, thereby enhancing structural accuracy. C-DiffSET achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming the very recent image-to-image translation methods and SET methods with large margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page https://kaist-viclab.github.io/C-DiffSET_site/</p></details> |

Unfortunately, the discrepancy between DMs and autoregressive models (ARMs) complicates the path toward achieving the goal of unified vision and language generation. Recently, the masked generative Transformer (MGT) serves as a promising intermediary between DM and ARM by predicting randomly masked image tokens (i.e., masked image modeling), combining the efficiency of DM with the discrete token nature of ARM. However, we find that the comprehensive analyses regarding the inference for MGT are virtually non-existent, and thus we aim to present positive design choices to fill this gap. We modify and re-design a set of DM-based inference techniques for MGT and further elucidate their performance on MGT. We also discuss the approach to correcting token's distribution to enhance inference. Extensive experiments and empirical analyses lead to concrete and effective design choices, and these design choices can be merged to achieve further performance gains. For instance, in terms of enhanced inference, we achieve winning rates of approximately 70% compared to vanilla sampling on HPS v2 with the recent SOTA MGT Meissonic. Our contributions have the potential to further enhance the capabilities and future development of MGTs.</p></details> |  |

In zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, aligning skeleton features with the text features of action labels is essential for accurately predicting unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment between skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these spaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated from the remarkable performance of text-to-image diffusion models, we leverage their alignment capabilities between different modalities mostly by focusing on the training process during reverse diffusion rather than using their generative power. Based on this, our framework is designed as a Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM) method which aligns skeleton features with text prompts through reverse diffusion, embedding the prompts into the unified skeleton-text latent space to achieve robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a novel triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing apart incorrect ones. Our TDSM significantly outperforms the very recent state-of-the-art methods with large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through effective skeleton-text matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at https://kaist-viclab.github.io/TDSM_site/</p></details> |
| **[White-Box Diffusion Transformer for single-cell RNA-seq generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06785v2)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a powerful tool for characterizing cellular subpopulations and cellular heterogeneity, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology offers advantages of high throughput and multidimensional analysis. However, the process of data acquisition is often constrained by high cost and limited sample availability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid model based on Diffusion model and White-Box transformer that aims to generate synthetic and biologically plausible scRNA-seq data. Diffusion model progressively introduce noise into the data and then recover the original data through a denoising process, a forward and reverse process that is particularly suitable for generating complex data distributions. White-Box transformer is a deep learning architecture that emphasizes mathematical interpretability. By minimizing the encoding rate of the data and maximizing the sparsity of the representation, it not only reduces the computational burden, but also provides clear insight into underlying structure. Our White-Box Diffusion Transformer combines the generative capabilities of Diffusion model with the mathematical interpretability of White-Box transformer. Through experiments using six different single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we visualize both generated and real data using t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique, as well as quantify similarity between generated and real data using various metrics to demonstrate comparable performance of White-Box Diffusion Transformer and Diffusion Transformer in generating scRNA-seq data alongside significant improvements in training efficiency and resource utilization.

| **[Efficient generative adversarial networks using linear additive-attention Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09596v4)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the capacity of deep generative models for image generation, such as Diffusion Models (DMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has dramatically improved in recent years, much of their success can be attributed to computationally expensive architectures. This has limited their adoption and use to research laboratories and companies with large resources, while significantly raising the carbon footprint for training, fine-tuning, and inference. In this work, we present a novel GAN architecture which we call LadaGAN. This architecture is based on a linear attention Transformer block named Ladaformer. The main component of this block is a linear additive-attention mechanism that computes a single attention vector per head instead of the quadratic dot-product attention. We employ Ladaformer in both the generator and discriminator, which reduces the computational complexity and overcomes the training instabilities often associated with Transformer GANs. LadaGAN consistently outperforms existing convolutional and Transformer GANs on benchmark datasets at different resolutions while being significantly more efficient. Moreover, LadaGAN shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multi-step generative models (e.g. DMs) using orders of magnitude less computational resources.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Current reconstruction-based methods provide a good alternative approach by measuring the reconstruction error between the input and its corresponding generative counterpart in the pixel/feature space. However, such generative methods face a key dilemma: improving the reconstruction power of the generative model while keeping a compact representation of the ID data. To address this issue, we propose the diffusion-based layer-wise semantic reconstruction approach for unsupervised OOD detection. The innovation of our approach is that we leverage the diffusion model's intrinsic data reconstruction ability to distinguish ID samples from OOD samples in the latent feature space. Moreover, to set up a comprehensive and discriminative feature representation, we devise a multi-layer semantic feature extraction strategy. By distorting the extracted features with Gaussian noise and applying the diffusion model for feature reconstruction, the separation of ID and OOD samples is implemented according to the reconstruction errors. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks built upon various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of detection accuracy and speed.

| **[EEG-Driven 3D Object Reconstruction with Style Consistency and Diffusion Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20981v3)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based visual perception reconstruction has become an important area of research. Neuroscientific studies indicate that humans can decode imagined 3D objects by perceiving or imagining various visual information, such as color, shape, and rotation. Existing EEG-based visual decoding methods typically focus only on the reconstruction of 2D visual stimulus images and face various challenges in generation quality, including inconsistencies in texture, shape, and color between the visual stimuli and the reconstructed images. This paper proposes an EEG-based 3D object reconstruction method with style consistency and diffusion priors. The method consists of an EEG-driven multi-task joint learning stage and an EEG-to-3D diffusion stage. The first stage uses a neural EEG encoder based on regional semantic learning, employing a multi-task joint learning scheme that includes a masked EEG signal recovery task and an EEG based visual classification task. The second stage introduces a latent diffusion model (LDM) fine-tuning strategy with style-conditioned constraints and a neural radiance field (NeRF) optimization strategy. This strategy explicitly embeds semantic- and location-aware latent EEG codes and combines them with visual stimulus maps to fine-tune the LDM. The fine-tuned LDM serves as a diffusion prior, which, combined with the style loss of visual stimuli, is used to optimize NeRF for generating 3D objects. Finally, through experimental validation, we demonstrate that this method can effectively use EEG data to reconstruct 3D objects with style consistency.</p></details> |  |

This is especially problematic in medical settings, where biased models fail when applied to different hospitals or systems. In such cases, data-driven methods to reduce spurious correlations are preferred, as clinicians can directly validate the modified images. While Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (Diffusion Models) show promise for natural images, they are impractical for medical use due to the difficulty of describing spurious medical features. To address this, we propose Masked Medical Image Inpainting (MaskMedPaint), which uses text-to-image diffusion models to augment training images by inpainting areas outside key classification regions to match the target domain. We demonstrate that MaskMedPaint enhances generalization to target domains across both natural (Waterbirds, iWildCam) and medical (ISIC 2018, Chest X-ray) datasets, given limited unlabeled target images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Motion Diffusion-Guided 3D Global HMR from a Dynamic Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10582v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion capture technologies have transformed numerous fields, from the film and gaming industries to sports science and healthcare, by providing a tool to capture and analyze human movement in great detail. The holy grail in the topic of monocular global human mesh and motion reconstruction (GHMR) is to achieve accuracy on par with traditional multi-view capture on any monocular videos captured with a dynamic camera, in-the-wild. This is a challenging task as the monocular input has inherent depth ambiguity, and the moving camera adds additional complexity as the rendered human motion is now a product of both human and camera movement. Not accounting for this confusion, existing GHMR methods often output motions that are unrealistic, e.g. unaccounted root translation of the human causes foot sliding. We present DiffOpt, a novel 3D global HMR method using Diffusion Optimization. Our key insight is that recent advances in human motion generation, such as the motion diffusion model (MDM), contain a strong prior of coherent human motion. The core of our method is to optimize the initial motion reconstruction using the MDM prior. This step can lead to more globally coherent human motion. Our optimization jointly optimizes the motion prior loss and reprojection loss to correctly disentangle the human and camera motions. We validate DiffOpt with video sequences from the Electromagnetic Database of Global 3D Human Pose and Shape in the Wild (EMDB) and Egobody, and demonstrate superior global human motion recovery capability over other state-of-the-art global HMR methods most prominently in long video settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, submitted to TMLR</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Model with Perceptual Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00110v6)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models without guidance tend to generate unrealistic samples, yet the cause of this problem is not fully studied. Our analysis suggests that the loss objective plays an important role in shaping the learned distribution and the common mean squared error loss is not optimal. We hypothesize that a better loss objective can be designed with inductive biases and propose a novel self-perceptual loss that utilizes the diffusion model itself as the perceptual loss. Our work demonstrates that perceptual loss can be used in diffusion training to improve sample quality effectively. Models trained using our objective can generate realistic samples without guidance. We hope our work paves the way for more future explorations of the diffusion loss objective.</p></details> |  |
| **[DLPO: Diffusion Model Loss-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Fine-Tuning Text-to-Speech Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14632v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have sparked a significant interest within the machine learning community. Particularly, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing images and speech. Studies such as those by Lee et al. (2023), Black et al. (2023), Wang et al. (2023), and Fan et al. (2024) illustrate that Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can enhance diffusion models for image synthesis. However, due to architectural differences between these models and those employed in speech synthesis, it remains uncertain whether RLHF could similarly benefit speech synthesis models. In this paper, we explore the practical application of RLHF to diffusion-based text-to-speech synthesis, leveraging the mean opinion score (MOS) as predicted by UTokyo-SaruLab MOS prediction system (Saeki et al., 2022) as a proxy loss. We introduce diffusion model loss-guided RL policy optimization (DLPO) and compare it against other RLHF approaches, employing the NISQA speech quality and naturalness assessment model (Mittag et al., 2021) and human preference experiments for further evaluation. Our results show that RLHF can enhance diffusion-based text-to-speech synthesis models, and, moreover, DLPO can better improve diffusion models in generating natural and high quality speech audios.</p></details> |  |
| **[An undetectable watermark for generative image models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07369v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first undetectable watermarking scheme for generative image models. Undetectability ensures that no efficient adversary can distinguish between watermarked and un-watermarked images, even after making many adaptive queries. In particular, an undetectable watermark does not degrade image quality under any efficiently computable metric. Our scheme works by selecting the initial latents of a diffusion model using a pseudorandom error-correcting code (Christ and Gunn, 2024), a strategy which guarantees undetectability and robustness. We experimentally demonstrate that our watermarks are quality-preserving and robust using Stable Diffusion 2.1. Our experiments verify that, in contrast to every prior scheme we tested, our watermark does not degrade image quality. Our experiments also demonstrate robustness: existing watermark removal attacks fail to remove our watermark from images without significantly degrading the quality of the images. Finally, we find that we can robustly encode 512 bits in our watermark, and up to 2500 bits when the images are not subjected to watermark removal attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/PRC-Watermark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Diffusion Priors from Observations by Expectation Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13712v4)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models recently proved to be remarkable priors for Bayesian inverse problems. However, training these models typically requires access to large amounts of clean data, which could prove difficult in some settings. In this work, we present a novel method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm for training diffusion models from incomplete and noisy observations only. Unlike previous works, our method leads to proper diffusion models, which is crucial for downstream tasks. As part of our method, we propose and motivate an improved posterior sampling scheme for unconditional diffusion models. We present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[M-VAR: Decoupled Scale-wise Autoregressive Modeling for High-Quality Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10433v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There exists recent work in computer vision, named VAR, that proposes a new autoregressive paradigm for image generation. Diverging from the vanilla next-token prediction, VAR structurally reformulates the image generation into a coarse to fine next-scale prediction. In this paper, we show that this scale-wise autoregressive framework can be effectively decoupled into \textit{intra-scale modeling}, which captures local spatial dependencies within each scale, and \textit{inter-scale modeling}, which models cross-scale relationships progressively from coarse-to-fine scales. This decoupling structure allows to rebuild VAR in a more computationally efficient manner. Specifically, for intra-scale modeling -- crucial for generating high-fidelity images -- we retain the original bidirectional self-attention design to ensure comprehensive modeling; for inter-scale modeling, which semantically connects different scales but is computationally intensive, we apply linear-complexity mechanisms like Mamba to substantially reduce computational overhead. We term this new framework M-VAR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models in both image quality and generation speed. For example, our 1.5B model, with fewer parameters and faster inference speed, outperforms the largest VAR-d30-2B. Moreover, our largest model M-VAR-d32 impressively registers 1.78 FID on ImageNet 256$\times$256 and outperforms the prior-art autoregressive models LlamaGen/VAR by 0.4/0.19 and popular diffusion models LDM/DiT by 1.82/0.49, respectively.

| **[Mitigating Parameter Degeneracy using Joint Conditional Diffusion Model for WECC Composite Load Model in Power Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10431v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven modeling for dynamic systems has gained widespread attention in recent years. Its inverse formulation, parameter estimation, aims to infer the inherent model parameters from observations. However, parameter degeneracy, where different combinations of parameters yield the same observable output, poses a critical barrier to accurately and uniquely identifying model parameters. In the context of WECC composite load model (CLM) in power systems, utility practitioners have observed that CLM parameters carefully selected for one fault event may not perform satisfactorily in another fault. Here, we innovate a joint conditional diffusion model-based inverse problem solver (JCDI), that incorporates a joint conditioning architecture with simultaneous inputs of multi-event observations to improve parameter generalizability. Simulation studies on the WECC CLM show that the proposed JCDI effectively reduces uncertainties of degenerate parameters, thus the parameter estimation error is decreased by 42.1% compared to a single-event learning scheme. This enables the model to achieve high accuracy in predicting power trajectories under different fault events, including electronic load tripping and motor stalling, outperforming standard deep reinforcement learning and supervised learning approaches. We anticipate this work will contribute to mitigating parameter degeneracy in system dynamics, providing a general parameter estimation framework across various scientific domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards High-Fidelity 3D Portrait Generation with Rich Details by Cross-View Prior-Aware Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10369v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion-based Single-image 3D portrait generation methods typically employ 2D diffusion models to provide multi-view knowledge, which is then distilled into 3D representations. However, these methods usually struggle to produce high-fidelity 3D models, frequently yielding excessively blurred textures. We attribute this issue to the insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency during the diffusion process, resulting in significant disparities between different views and ultimately leading to blurred 3D representations. In this paper, we address this issue by comprehensively exploiting multi-view priors in both the conditioning and diffusion procedures to produce consistent, detail-rich portraits. From the conditioning standpoint, we propose a Hybrid Priors Diffsion model, which explicitly and implicitly incorporates multi-view priors as conditions to enhance the status consistency of the generated multi-view portraits. From the diffusion perspective, considering the significant impact of the diffusion noise distribution on detailed texture generation, we propose a Multi-View Noise Resamplig Strategy integrated within the optimization process leveraging cross-view priors to enhance representation consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce 3D portraits with accurate geometry and rich details from a single image.

We propose the Probabilistic Prior Turbulence Removal Network (PPTRN), which combines probabilistic diffusion-based prior modeling with Transformer-driven feature extraction to address this issue. PPTRN employs a two-stage approach: first, a latent encoder and Transformer are jointly trained on clear images to establish robust feature representations. Then, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) models prior distributions over latent vectors, guiding the Transformer in capturing diverse feature variations essential for restoration. A key innovation in PPTRN is the Probabilistic Prior Driven Cross Attention mechanism, which integrates the DDPM-generated prior with feature embeddings to reduce artifacts and enhance spatial coherence. Extensive experiments validate that PPTRN significantly improves restoration quality on turbulence-degraded images, setting a new benchmark in clarity and structural fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inconsistencies In Consistency Models: Better ODE Solving Does Not Imply Better Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08954v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion models can generate remarkably high-quality samples, they are intrinsically bottlenecked by their expensive iterative sampling procedure. Consistency models (CMs) have recently emerged as a promising diffusion model distillation method, reducing the cost of sampling by generating high-fidelity samples in just a few iterations. Consistency model distillation aims to solve the probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) defined by an existing diffusion model. CMs are not directly trained to minimize error against an ODE solver, rather they use a more computationally tractable objective. As a way to study how effectively CMs solve the probability flow ODE, and the effect that any induced error has on the quality of generated samples, we introduce Direct CMs, which \textit{directly} minimize this error. Intriguingly, we find that Direct CMs reduce the ODE solving error compared to CMs but also result in significantly worse sample quality, calling into question why exactly CMs work well in the first place.

To tackle this problem, we propose the Reference-Driven Inpainting Stitcher (RDIStitcher), which reformulates the image fusion and rectangling as a reference-based inpainting model, incorporating a larger modification fusion area and stronger modification intensity than previous methods. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised model training method, which enables the implementation of RDIStitcher without requiring labeled data by fine-tuning a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model. Recognizing difficulties in assessing the quality of stitched images, we present the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)-based metrics, offering a new perspective on evaluating stitched image quality. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances content coherence and seamless transitions in the stitched images. Especially in the zero-shot experiments, our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Code: https://github.com/yayoyo66/RDIStitcher</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

Recent advancements in diffusion models have made considerable progress in this field. Nevertheless, a critical limitation is their lack of awareness of specific degradation, leading to potential issues such as unnatural details and inaccurate textures. In this paper, we equip diffusion models with the capability to decouple various degradation as a degradation prompt from low-quality (LQ) face images via unsupervised contrastive learning with reconstruction loss, and demonstrate that this capability significantly improves performance, particularly in terms of the naturalness of the restored images. Our novel restoration scheme, named DR-BFR, guides the denoising of Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) by incorporating Degradation Representation (DR) and content features from LQ images. DR-BFR comprises two modules: 1) Degradation Representation Module (DRM): This module extracts degradation representation with content-irrelevant features from LQ faces and estimates a reasonable distribution in the degradation space through contrastive learning and a specially designed LQ reconstruction. 2) Latent Diffusion Restoration Module (LDRM): This module perceives both degradation features and content features in the latent space, enabling the restoration of high-quality images from LQ inputs. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed DR-BFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively across various datasets. The DR effectively distinguishes between various degradations in blind face inverse problems and provides a reasonably powerful prompt to LDM.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Guidance for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10257v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidance is an error-correcting technique used to improve the perceptual quality of images generated by diffusion models. Typically, the correction is achieved by linear extrapolation, using an auxiliary diffusion model that has lower performance than the primary model. Using a 2D toy example, we show that it is highly beneficial when the auxiliary model exhibits similar errors as the primary one but stronger. We verify this finding in higher dimensions, where we show that competitive generative performance to state-of-the-art guidance methods can be achieved when the auxiliary model differs from the primary one only by having stronger weight regularization. As an independent contribution, we investigate whether upweighting long-range spatial dependencies improves visual fidelity. The result is a novel guidance method, which we call sliding window guidance (SWG), that guides the primary model with itself by constraining its receptive field. Intriguingly, SWG aligns better with human preferences than state-of-the-art guidance methods while requiring neither training, architectural modifications, nor class conditioning.

However, due to attention leakage and collision between the cross-attention map of the object and the new color attribute from the text prompt, text-guided image editing methods may fail to change the color of an object, resulting in a misalignment between the resulting image and the text prompt. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the process of text-guided image synthesizing and what semantic information different cross-attention blocks have learned. We observe that the visual representation of an object is determined in the up-block of the diffusion model in the early stage of the denoising process, and color adjustment can be achieved through value matrices alignment in the cross-attention layer. Based on our findings, we propose a straightforward, yet stable, and effective image-guided method to modify the color of an object without requiring any additional fine-tuning or training. Lastly, we present a benchmark dataset called COLORBENCH, the first benchmark to evaluate the performance of color change methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in object-level color editing and surpass the performance of popular text-guided image editing approaches in both synthesized and real images.</p></details> |  |

Synthetic data generation offers a promising alternative, but limiting the sim-to-real gap requires significant engineering efforts. To reduce this engineering effort, we investigate the use of pretrained text-to-image diffusion models for texturing synthetic images and compare this approach with using random textures, a common domain randomization technique in synthetic data generation. We focus on generating object-centric representations, such as keypoints and segmentation masks, which are important for robotic manipulation and require precise annotations. We evaluate the efficacy of the texturing methods by training models on the synthetic data and measuring their performance on real-world datasets for three object categories: shoes, T-shirts, and mugs. Surprisingly, we find that texturing using a diffusion model performs on par with random textures, despite generating seemingly more realistic images. Our results suggest that, for now, using diffusion models for texturing does not benefit synthetic data generation for robotics.

Although image style transfer has been extensively researched with promising results, directly applying 2D style transfer methods to 3D scenes often fails to preserve the structural and multi-view properties of 3D environments, resulting in unpleasant distortions in images from different viewpoints. To address these issues, we leverage the remarkable generative prior of diffusion-based models and propose a novel style transfer method, OSDiffST, based on a pre-trained one-step diffusion model (i.e., SD-Turbo) for rendering diverse styles in multi-view images of 3D scenes. To efficiently adapt the pre-trained model for multi-view style transfer on small datasets, we introduce a vision condition module to extract style information from the reference style image to serve as conditional input for the diffusion model and employ LoRA in diffusion model for adaptation. Additionally, we consider color distribution alignment and structural similarity between the stylized and content images using two specific loss functions. As a result, our method effectively preserves the structural information and multi-view consistency in stylized images without any 3D information. Experiments show that our method surpasses other promising style transfer methods in synthesizing various styles for multi-view images of 3D scenes. Stylized images from different viewpoints generated by our method achieve superior visual quality, with better structural integrity and less distortion.

Most methods tacking this problem rely on providing user-defined controls, such as binary masks or camera movement embeddings. In our approach we propose OnlyFlow, an approach leveraging the optical flow firstly extracted from an input video to condition the motion of generated videos. Using a text prompt and an input video, OnlyFlow allows the user to generate videos that respect the motion of the input video as well as the text prompt. This is implemented through an optical flow estimation model applied on the input video, which is then fed to a trainable optical flow encoder. The output feature maps are then injected into the text-to-video backbone model. We perform quantitative, qualitative and user preference studies to show that OnlyFlow positively compares to state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of tasks, even though OnlyFlow was not specifically trained for such tasks. OnlyFlow thus constitutes a versatile, lightweight yet efficient method for controlling motion in text-to-video generation.

| **[Prompt-Guided Environmentally Consistent Adversarial Patch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10498v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks in the physical world pose a significant threat to the security of vision-based systems, such as facial recognition and autonomous driving. Existing adversarial patch methods primarily focus on improving attack performance, but they often produce patches that are easily detectable by humans and struggle to achieve environmental consistency, i.e., blending patches into the environment. This paper introduces a novel approach for generating adversarial patches, which addresses both the visual naturalness and environmental consistency of the patches. We propose Prompt-Guided Environmentally Consistent Adversarial Patch (PG-ECAP), a method that aligns the patch with the environment to ensure seamless integration into the environment. The approach leverages diffusion models to generate patches that are both environmental consistency and effective in evading detection. To further enhance the naturalness and consistency, we introduce two alignment losses: Prompt Alignment Loss and Latent Space Alignment Loss, ensuring that the generated patch maintains its adversarial properties while fitting naturally within its environment. Extensive experiments in both digital and physical domains demonstrate that PG-ECAP outperforms existing methods in attack success rate and environmental consistency.</p></details> |  |

Currently, many perception algorithms are designed for specific purposes, which limits the flexibility of the perception module. We present a general problem formulation called 3D scene-to-pose-set matching, which directly matches the corresponding poses from the scene without relying on task-specific heuristics. To address this, we introduce SPLIT, an SE(3)-diffusion model for generating pose samples from a scene. The model's efficiency comes from predicting scores based on local geometry with respect to the sample pose. Moreover, leveraging the conditioned generation capability of diffusion models, we demonstrate that SPLIT can generate the multi-purpose poses, required to complete both the mug reorientation and hanging manipulation within a single model.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffLoRA: Generating Personalized Low-Rank Adaptation Weights with Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06740v3)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized text-to-image generation has gained significant attention for its capability to generate high-fidelity portraits of specific identities conditioned on user-defined prompts. Existing methods typically involve test-time fine-tuning or incorporating an additional pre-trained branch. However, these approaches struggle to simultaneously address efficiency, identity fidelity, and the preservation of the model's original generative capabilities. In this paper, we propose DiffLoRA, an efficient method that leverages the diffusion model as a hypernetwork to predict personalized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights based on the reference images. By incorporating these LoRA weights into the off-the-shelf text-to-image model, DiffLoRA enables zero-shot personalization during inference, eliminating the need for post-processing optimization. Moreover, we introduce a novel identity-oriented LoRA weights construction pipeline to facilitate the training process of DiffLoRA. The dataset generated through this pipeline enables DiffLoRA to produce consistently high-quality LoRA weights. Notably, the distinctive properties of the diffusion model enhance the generation of superior weights by employing probabilistic modeling to capture intricate structural patterns and thoroughly explore the weight space. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DiffLoRA outperforms existing personalization approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving both time efficiency and maintaining identity fidelity throughout the personalization process.</p></details> | 9 pages,8 figures |

Given base diffusion models for audio and video, we integrate them with additional modules into a single model and train it to make the model jointly generate audio and video. To enhance alignment between audio-video pairs, we introduce two novel mechanisms in our model. The first one is timestep adjustment, which provides different timestep information to each base model. It is designed to align how samples are generated along with timesteps across modalities. The second one is a new design of the additional modules, termed Cross-Modal Conditioning as Positional Encoding (CMC-PE). In CMC-PE, cross-modal information is embedded as if it represents temporal position information, and the embeddings are fed into the model like positional encoding. Compared with the popular cross-attention mechanism, CMC-PE provides a better inductive bias for temporal alignment in the generated data. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the two newly introduced mechanisms and also demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available: https://github.com/SonyResearch/SVG_baseline</p></details> |

Deep learning (DL) offers a promising solution for automatic disease screening but demands substantial data. Collecting and labeling large volumes of ophthalmic images across various modalities encounters several real-world challenges, especially for rare diseases. Here, we introduce EyeDiff, a text-to-image model designed to generate multimodal ophthalmic images from natural language prompts and evaluate its applicability in diagnosing common and rare diseases. EyeDiff is trained on eight large-scale datasets using the advanced latent diffusion model, covering 14 ophthalmic image modalities and over 80 ocular diseases, and is adapted to ten multi-country external datasets. The generated images accurately capture essential lesional characteristics, achieving high alignment with text prompts as evaluated by objective metrics and human experts. Furthermore, integrating generated images significantly enhances the accuracy of detecting minority classes and rare eye diseases, surpassing traditional oversampling methods in addressing data imbalance. EyeDiff effectively tackles the issue of data imbalance and insufficiency typically encountered in rare diseases and addresses the challenges of collecting large-scale annotated images, offering a transformative solution to enhance the development of expert-level diseases diagnosis models in ophthalmic field.</p></details> | 28 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Adaptive Non-Uniform Timestep Sampling for Diffusion Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09998v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a highly expressive generative model, diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional success across various domains, including image generation, natural language processing, and combinatorial optimization. However, as data distributions grow more complex, training these models to convergence becomes increasingly computationally intensive. While diffusion models are typically trained using uniform timestep sampling, our research shows that the variance in stochastic gradients varies significantly across timesteps, with high-variance timesteps becoming bottlenecks that hinder faster convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a non-uniform timestep sampling method that prioritizes these more critical timesteps. Our method tracks the impact of gradient updates on the objective for each timestep, adaptively selecting those most likely to minimize the objective effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only accelerates the training process, but also leads to improved performance at convergence. Furthermore, our method shows robust performance across various datasets, scheduling strategies, and diffusion architectures, outperforming previously proposed timestep sampling and weighting heuristics that lack this degree of robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boundary Attention Constrained Zero-Shot Layout-To-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10495v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-resolution images from text but struggle with precise control over spatial composition and object counting. To address these challenges, several studies developed layout-to-image (L2I) approaches that incorporate layout instructions into text-to-image models. However, existing L2I methods typically require either fine-tuning pretrained parameters or training additional control modules for the diffusion models. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot L2I approach, BACON (Boundary Attention Constrained generation), which eliminates the need for additional modules or fine-tuning. Specifically, we use text-visual cross-attention feature maps to quantify inconsistencies between the layout of the generated images and the provided instructions, and then compute loss functions to optimize latent features during the diffusion reverse process. To enhance spatial controllability and mitigate semantic failures in complex layout instructions, we leverage pixel-to-pixel correlations in the self-attention feature maps to align cross-attention maps and combine three loss functions constrained by boundary attention to update latent features. Comprehensive experimental results on both L2I and non-L2I pretrained diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing zero-shot L2I techniuqes both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of image composition on the DrawBench and HRS benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[IDEATOR: Jailbreaking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks--techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multi-modal data has led current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which may lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel jailbreak method named IDEATOR, which autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is based on the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR uses a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability. Notably, it achieves a 94% success rate in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high success rates of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Meta's Chameleon, respectively. IDEATOR uncovers specific vulnerabilities in VLMs under black-box conditions, underscoring the need for improved safety mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

By synthesizing over 100 publications, we explore methods from generative adversarial networks to diffusion models, examining multimodal integration for fine-grained content control. We discuss practical applications across domains such as fashion, 3D scene manipulation, and video synthesis, highlighting increased accessibility and alignment with human intuition. Our survey compares existing literature, emphasizing LLM-empowered editing, and identifies key challenges to stimulate further research.

In contrast, contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) facilitates the observation of regions of interest (ROI). Leading generative models, especially the conditional diffusion model, demonstrate remarkable capabilities in medical image modality transformation. Typical conditional diffusion models commonly generate images with guidance of segmentation labels for medical modal transformation. Limited access to authentic guidance and its low cardinality can pose challenges to the practical clinical application of conditional diffusion models. To achieve an equilibrium of generative quality and clinical practices, we propose a novel Syncretic generative model based on the latent diffusion model for medical image translation (S$^2$LDM), which can realize high-fidelity reconstruction without demand of additional condition during inference. S$^2$LDM enhances the similarity in distinct modal images via syncretic encoding and diffusing, promoting amalgamated information in the latent space and generating medical images with more details in contrast-enhanced regions. However, syncretic latent spaces in the frequency domain tend to favor lower frequencies, commonly locate in identical anatomic structures. Thus, S$^2$LDM applies adaptive similarity loss and dynamic similarity to guide the generation and supplements the shortfall in high-frequency details throughout the training process. Quantitative experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach in medical image translation. Our code will release lately.</p></details> | <details><summary>We de...</summary><p>We decide to modify the majority of the content</p></details> |

The emerging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) exhibits the significant potential for dense haze removal with its strong generation ability. Since remote sensing images contain extensive small-scale texture structures, it is important to effectively restore image details from hazy images. However, current wisdom of DDPM fails to preserve image details and color fidelity well, limiting its dehazing capacity for remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel unified Fourier-aware diffusion model for remote sensing image dehazing, termed RSHazeDiff. From a new perspective, RSHazeDiff explores the conditional DDPM to improve image quality in dense hazy scenarios, and it makes three key contributions. First, RSHazeDiff refines the training phase of diffusion process by performing noise estimation and reconstruction constraints in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Thus, it remedies the unpleasing results caused by the simple noise estimation constraint in DDPM. Second, by taking the frequency information as important prior knowledge during iterative sampling steps, RSHazeDiff can preserve more texture details and color fidelity in dehazed images. Third, we design a global compensated learning module to utilize the Fourier transform to capture the global dependency features of input images, which can effectively mitigate the effects of boundary artifacts when processing fixed-size patches. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the favorable performance of RSHazeDiff over state-of-the-art methods.

Unsupervised environment design (UED) has recently emerged to address this issue by generating a set of training environments tailored to the agent's capabilities. While prior works demonstrate that UED has the potential to learn a robust policy, their performance is constrained by the capabilities of the environment generation. To this end, we propose a novel UED algorithm, adversarial environment design via regret-guided diffusion models (ADD). The proposed method guides the diffusion-based environment generator with the regret of the agent to produce environments that the agent finds challenging but conducive to further improvement. By exploiting the representation power of diffusion models, ADD can directly generate adversarial environments while maintaining the diversity of training environments, enabling the agent to effectively learn a robust policy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully generates an instructive curriculum of environments, outperforming UED baselines in zero-shot generalization across novel, out-of-distribution environments.

Face de-identification usually refers to the process of concealing or replacing personal identifiers, which is regarded as an effective means to protect the privacy of facial images. A significant number of methods for face de-identification have been proposed in recent years. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art face de-identification methods, categorized into three levels: pixel-level, representation-level, and semantic-level techniques. We systematically evaluate these methods based on two key criteria, the effectiveness of privacy protection and preservation of image utility, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Our analysis includes qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the main algorithms, demonstrating that deep learning-based approaches, particularly those using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models, have achieved significant advancements in balancing privacy and utility. Experimental results reveal that while recent methods demonstrate strong privacy protection, trade-offs remain in visual fidelity and computational complexity. This survey not only summarizes the current landscape but also identifies key challenges and future research directions in face de-identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems by Integrating Crafted Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09850v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful foundation model for visual generation. With an appropriate sampling process, it can effectively serve as a generative prior to solve general inverse problems. Current posterior sampling based methods take the measurement (i.e., degraded image sample) into the posterior sampling to infer the distribution of the target data (i.e., clean image sample). However, in this manner, we show that high-frequency information can be prematurely introduced during the early stages, which could induce larger posterior estimate errors during the restoration sampling. To address this issue, we first reveal that forming the log posterior gradient with the noisy measurement ( i.e., samples from a diffusion forward process) instead of the clean one can benefit the reverse process. Consequently, we propose a novel diffusion posterior sampling method DPS-CM, which incorporates a Crafted Measurement (i.e., samples generated by a reverse denoising process, compared to random sampling with noise in standard methods) to form the posterior estimate. This integration aims to mitigate the misalignment with the diffusion prior caused by cumulative posterior estimate errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the overall capacity to solve general and noisy inverse problems, such as Gaussian deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, nonlinear deblurring, and tasks with Poisson noise, relative to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

While these diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, the underlying mechanisms driving their performance are not yet fully accounted for, with many unanswered questions surrounding what they learn, how they represent visual-semantic relationships, and why they sometimes fail to generalize. Our work presents Diffusion Partial Information Decomposition (DiffusionPID), a novel technique that applies information-theoretic principles to decompose the input text prompt into its elementary components, enabling a detailed examination of how individual tokens and their interactions shape the generated image. We introduce a formal approach to analyze the uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy terms by applying PID to the denoising model at both the image and pixel level. This approach enables us to characterize how individual tokens and their interactions affect the model output. We first present a fine-grained analysis of characteristics utilized by the model to uniquely localize specific concepts, we then apply our approach in bias analysis and show it can recover gender and ethnicity biases. Finally, we use our method to visually characterize word ambiguity and similarity from the model's perspective and illustrate the efficacy of our method for prompt intervention. Our results show that PID is a potent tool for evaluating and diagnosing text-to-image diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Consistency Tuning: Understanding and Improving Consistency Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18958v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models achieve superior generation quality but suffer from slow generation speed due to the iterative nature of denoising. In contrast, consistency models, a new generative family, achieve competitive performance with significantly faster sampling. These models are trained either through consistency distillation, which leverages pretrained diffusion models, or consistency training/tuning directly from raw data. In this work, we propose a novel framework for understanding consistency models by modeling the denoising process of the diffusion model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and framing consistency model training as the value estimation through Temporal Difference~(TD) Learning. More importantly, this framework allows us to analyze the limitations of current consistency training/tuning strategies. Built upon Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), we propose Stable Consistency Tuning (SCT), which incorporates variance-reduced learning using the score identity. SCT leads to significant performance improvements on benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64. On ImageNet-64, SCT achieves 1-step FID 2.42 and 2-step FID 1.55, a new SoTA for consistency models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/G-U-N/Stable-Consistency-Tuning</p></details> |

One promising application in real-life situations is the automatic estimation of facial paralysis. However, the scarcity of facial paralysis datasets limits the development of robust machine learning models for automated diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. To this end, this study aims to synthesize a high-quality facial paralysis dataset to address this gap, enabling more accurate and efficient algorithm training. Specifically, a novel Cross-Fusion Cycle Palsy Expression Generative Model (CFCPalsy) based on the diffusion model is proposed to combine different features of facial information and enhance the visual details of facial appearance and texture in facial regions, thus creating synthetic facial images that accurately represent various degrees and types of facial paralysis. We have qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the proposed method on the commonly used public clinical datasets of facial paralysis to demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods, generating more realistic facial images and maintaining identity consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Golden Noise for Diffusion Models: A Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09502v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise. While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis and have been recently utilized to counter $\ell_p$-norm bounded attacks, their potential in mitigating localized patch attacks remains largely underexplored. In this work, we propose DiffPAD, a novel framework that harnesses the power of diffusion models for adversarial patch decontamination. DiffPAD first performs super-resolution restoration on downsampled input images, then adopts binarization, dynamic thresholding scheme and sliding window for effective localization of adversarial patches. Such a design is inspired by the theoretically derived correlation between patch size and diffusion restoration error that is generalized across diverse patch attack scenarios. Finally, DiffPAD applies inpainting techniques to the original input images with the estimated patch region being masked. By integrating closed-form solutions for super-resolution restoration and image inpainting into the conditional reverse sampling process of a pre-trained diffusion model, DiffPAD obviates the need for text guidance or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DiffPAD not only achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness against patch attacks but also excels in recovering naturalistic images without patch remnants.

Nevertheless, owing to the complexity and variability of real-world road environments, creating authentic and varied scenarios for intelligent driving testing is challenging. In this paper, we propose DiffRoad, a novel diffusion model designed to produce controllable and high-fidelity 3D road scenarios. DiffRoad leverages the generative capabilities of diffusion models to synthesize road layouts from white noise through an inverse denoising process, preserving real-world spatial features. To enhance the quality of generated scenarios, we design the Road-UNet architecture, optimizing the balance between backbone and skip connections for high-realism scenario generation. Furthermore, we introduce a road scenario evaluation module that screens adequate and reasonable scenarios for intelligent driving testing using two critical metrics: road continuity and road reasonableness. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate DiffRoad's ability to generate realistic and smooth road structures while maintaining the original distribution. Additionally, the generated scenarios can be fully automated into the OpenDRIVE format, facilitating generalized autonomous vehicle simulation testing. DiffRoad provides a rich and diverse scenario library for large-scale autonomous vehicle testing and offers valuable insights for future infrastructure designs that are better suited for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

With the emergence of new diffusion models, assessing the performance of text-to-image models has become increasingly important. Current metrics focus on directly matching the input text with the generated image, but due to cross-modal information asymmetry, this leads to unreliable or incomplete assessment results. Motivated by this, we introduce the Image Regeneration task in this study to assess text-to-image models by tasking the T2I model with generating an image according to the reference image. We use GPT4V to bridge the gap between the reference image and the text input for the T2I model, allowing T2I models to understand image content. This evaluation process is simplified as comparisons between the generated image and the reference image are straightforward. Two regeneration datasets spanning content-diverse and style-diverse evaluation dataset are introduced to evaluate the leading diffusion models currently available. Additionally, we present ImageRepainter framework to enhance the quality of generated images by improving content comprehension via MLLM guided iterative generation and revision. Our comprehensive experiments have showcased the effectiveness of this framework in assessing the generative capabilities of models. By leveraging MLLM, we have demonstrated that a robust T2M can produce images more closely resembling the reference image.</p></details> |  |

However, manual animation is tedious and automated techniques are often specialized to narrow shape classes. In our work, we propose a technique for automatic re-animation of various 3D shapes based on a motion prior extracted from a video diffusion model. Unlike existing 4D generation methods, we focus solely on the motion, and we leverage an explicit mesh-based representation compatible with existing computer-graphics pipelines. Furthermore, our utilization of diffusion features enhances accuracy of our motion fitting. We analyze efficacy of these features for animation fitting and we experimentally validate our approach for two different diffusion models and four animation models. Finally, we demonstrate that our time-efficient zero-shot method achieves a superior performance re-animating a diverse set of 3D shapes when compared to existing techniques in a user study.

Despite the popularity of probabilistic generative models, numerical experiments benchmarking their performance on molecular data are lacking. In this work, we introduce and explain several classes of generative models, broadly sorted into two categories: flow-based models and diffusion models. We select three representative models: Neural Spline Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, and examine their accuracy, computational cost, and generation speed across datasets with tunable dimensionality, complexity, and modal asymmetry. Our findings are varied, with no one framework being the best for all purposes. In a nutshell, (i) Neural Spline Flows do best at capturing mode asymmetry present in low-dimensional data, (ii) Conditional Flow Matching outperforms other models for high-dimensional data with low complexity, and (iii) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models appears the best for low-dimensional data with high complexity. Our datasets include a Gaussian mixture model and the dihedral torsion angle distribution of the Aib\textsubscript{9} peptide, generated via a molecular dynamics simulation. We hope our taxonomy of probabilistic generative frameworks and numerical results may guide model selection for a wide range of molecular tasks.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches to synthesizing multi-relational (multi-table) data fall short in two key aspects: scalability for larger datasets and capturing long-range dependencies, such as correlations between attributes spread across different tables. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in tabular data modeling, we introduce $\textbf{C}luster$ $\textbf{La}tent$ $\textbf{Va}riable$ $guided$ $\textbf{D}enoising$ $\textbf{D}iffusion$ $\textbf{P}robabilistic$ $\textbf{M}odels$ (ClavaDDPM). This novel approach leverages clustering labels as intermediaries to model relationships between tables, specifically focusing on foreign key constraints. ClavaDDPM leverages the robust generation capabilities of diffusion models while incorporating efficient algorithms to propagate the learned latent variables across tables. This enables ClavaDDPM to capture long-range dependencies effectively. Extensive evaluations on multi-table datasets of varying sizes show that ClavaDDPM significantly outperforms existing methods for these long-range dependencies while remaining competitive on utility metrics for single-table data.</p></details> |  |

The ensemble comprises three models with kernel sizes of 51, 101, and 201, effectively capturing multi-scale temporal features inherent in signals. This approach improves the robustness and accuracy of speech decoding by accommodating the rich temporal complexity of neural signals. The ensemble models work in conjunction with conditional autoencoders that refine the reconstructed signals and maximize the useful information for downstream classification tasks. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble-based approach significantly outperforms individual models and existing state-of-the-art techniques. These findings demonstrate the potential of ensemble methods in advancing brain signal decoding, offering new possibilities for non-verbal communication applications, particularly in brain-computer interface systems aimed at aiding individuals with speech impairments.</p></details> |  |

The attention head can simultaneously delete, copy, or retain tokens by assigning them negative, positive, or minimal attention weights, respectively. As a result, a single attention head becomes more flexible and expressive. (2) Cog Attention improves the model's robustness against representational collapse, which can occur when earlier tokens are over-squashed into later positions, leading to homogeneous representations. Negative weights reduce effective information paths from earlier to later tokens, helping to mitigate this issue. We develop Transformer-like models which use Cog Attention as attention modules, including decoder-only models for language modeling and U-ViT diffusion models for image generation. Experiments show that models using Cog Attention exhibit superior performance compared to those employing traditional softmax attention modules. Our approach suggests a promising research direction for rethinking and breaking the entrenched constraints of traditional softmax attention, such as the requirement for non-negative weights.</p></details> |  |

While traditional Machine Learning (TML) approaches have demonstrated effectiveness, they often encounter substantial obstacles in real-world applications, including the variability of optimal feature sets, subjectivity in human-driven design, inherent biases, and methodological limitations. Specifically, TML suffers from the curse of dimensionality, difficulties in feature selection and extraction, insufficient consideration of spatial information, limited robustness against noise, scalability issues, and inadequate adaptability to complex data distributions. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have emerged as robust solutions to address these challenges. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of current trends and future prospects in HSC, emphasizing advancements from DL models to the increasing adoption of Transformer and Mamba Model architectures. We systematically review key concepts, methodologies, and state-of-the-art approaches in DL for HSC. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of Transformer-based models and the Mamba Model in HSC, detailing their advantages and challenges. Emerging trends in HSC are explored, including in-depth discussions on Explainable AI and Interoperability concepts, alongside Diffusion Models for image denoising, feature extraction, and image fusion. Comprehensive experimental results were conducted on three HS datasets to substantiate the efficacy of various conventional DL models and Transformers. Additionally, we identify several open challenges and pertinent research questions in the field of HSC. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential applications aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of HSC.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, diffusion models are still challenged by model-induced artifacts and limited stability in image fidelity. In this work, we hypothesize that the primary cause of this issue is the improper resampling operation that introduces aliasing in the diffusion model and a careful alias-free resampling dictated by image processing theory can improve the model's performance in image synthesis. We propose the integration of alias-free resampling layers into the UNet architecture of diffusion models without adding extra trainable parameters, thereby maintaining computational efficiency. We then assess whether these theory-driven modifications enhance image quality and rotational equivariance. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, MNIST, and MNIST-M, reveal consistent gains in image quality, particularly in terms of FID and KID scores. Furthermore, we propose a modified diffusion process that enables user-controlled rotation of generated images without requiring additional training. Our findings highlight the potential of theory-driven enhancements such as alias-free resampling in generative models to improve image quality while maintaining model efficiency and pioneer future research directions to incorporate them into video-generating diffusion models, enabling deeper exploration of the applications of alias-free resampling in generative modeling.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

To enhance user experience in practical applications, recent studies investigate VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, existing studies mainly focus on single-concept personalization, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits the real-world applicability of personalized VLMs. In this paper, we propose the first multi-concept personalization method named MC-LLaVA along with a high-quality multi-concept personalization dataset. Specifically, MC-LLaVA uses a joint training strategy incorporating multiple concepts in a single training step, allowing VLMs to perform accurately in multi-concept personalization. To reduce the cost of joint training, MC-LLaVA leverages visual token information for concept token initialization, yielding improved concept representation and accelerating joint training. To advance multi-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality dataset. We carefully collect images from various movies that contain multiple characters and manually generate the multi-concept question-answer samples. Our dataset features diverse movie types and question-answer types. We conduct comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that MC-LLaVA can achieve impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user-specific assistants. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/arctanxarc/MC-LLaVA.</p></details> |  |

The advent of powerful tools such as large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of these robots in environmental perception and decision-making. However, the introduction of these intelligent agents has led to security threats such as jailbreak attacks and adversarial attacks. In this research, we take a further step by proposing a backdoor attack specifically targeting robotic manipulation and, for the first time, implementing backdoor attack in the physical world. By embedding a backdoor visual language model into the visual perception module within the robotic system, we successfully mislead the robotic arm's operation in the physical world, given the presence of common items as triggers. Experimental evaluations in the physical world demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Initi...</summary><p>Initial version with preliminary results.

To alleviate artifacts and improve quality of synthetic images, we fine-tune Vision-Language Model (VLM) as artifact classifier to automatically identify and classify a wide range of artifacts and provide supervision for further optimizing generative models. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive artifact taxonomy and construct a dataset of synthetic images with artifact annotations for fine-tuning VLM, named SynArtifact-1K. The fine-tuned VLM exhibits superior ability of identifying artifacts and outperforms the baseline by 25.66%. To our knowledge, this is the first time such end-to-end artifact classification task and solution have been proposed. Finally, we leverage the output of VLM as feedback to refine the generative model for alleviating artifacts. Visualization results and user study demonstrate that the quality of images synthesized by the refined diffusion model has been obviously improved.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLN-Game: Vision-Language Equilibrium Search for Zero-Shot Semantic Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11609v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following human instructions to explore and search for a specified target in an unfamiliar environment is a crucial skill for mobile service robots. Most of the previous works on object goal navigation have typically focused on a single input modality as the target, which may lead to limited consideration of language descriptions containing detailed attributes and spatial relationships. To address this limitation, we propose VLN-Game, a novel zero-shot framework for visual target navigation that can process object names and descriptive language targets effectively. To be more precise, our approach constructs a 3D object-centric spatial map by integrating pre-trained visual-language features with a 3D reconstruction of the physical environment. Then, the framework identifies the most promising areas to explore in search of potential target candidates. A game-theoretic vision language model is employed to determine which target best matches the given language description. Experiments conducted on the Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object goal navigation and language-based navigation tasks. Moreover, we show that VLN-Game can be easily deployed on real-world robots. The success of VLN-Game highlights the promising potential of using game-theoretic methods with compact vision-language models to advance decision-making capabilities in robotic systems.

However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular VLM safety benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.13581</p></details> |

Exploring How Safe Images Can Be Exploited to Jailbreak Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11496v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have showcased strong reasoning abilities across multiple modalities, achieving significant breakthroughs in various real-world applications. Despite this great success, the safety guardrail of LVLMs may not cover the unforeseen domains introduced by the visual modality. Existing studies primarily focus on eliciting LVLMs to generate harmful responses via carefully crafted image-based jailbreaks designed to bypass alignment defenses. In this study, we reveal that a safe image can be exploited to achieve the same jailbreak consequence when combined with additional safe images and prompts. This stems from two fundamental properties of LVLMs: universal reasoning capabilities and safety snowball effect. Building on these insights, we propose Safety Snowball Agent (SSA), a novel agent-based framework leveraging agents' autonomous and tool-using abilities to jailbreak LVLMs. SSA operates through two principal stages: (1) initial response generation, where tools generate or retrieve jailbreak images based on potential harmful intents, and (2) harmful snowballing, where refined subsequent prompts induce progressively harmful outputs. Our experiments demonstrate that \ours can use nearly any image to induce LVLMs to produce unsafe content, achieving high success jailbreaking rates against the latest LVLMs. Unlike prior works that exploit alignment flaws, \ours leverages the inherent properties of LVLMs, presenting a profound challenge for enforcing safety in generative multimodal systems.

More specifically, it corresponds to the system's ability to identify and match a previously visited location using computer vision tools.

To address this gap, we introduce Value-Spectrum, a visual question-answering benchmark aimed at assessing VLMs based on Schwartz's value dimensions, which capture core values guiding people's beliefs and actions across cultures. We constructed a vectorized database of over 50,000 short videos sourced from TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels, covering multiple months and a wide array of topics such as family, health, hobbies, society, and technology. We also developed a VLM agent pipeline to automate video browsing and analysis. Benchmarking representative VLMs on Value-Spectrum reveals significant differences in their responses to value-oriented content, with most models exhibiting a preference for hedonistic topics. Beyond identifying natural preferences, we explored the ability of VLM agents to adopt specific personas when explicitly prompted, revealing insights into the models' adaptability in role-playing scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of Value-Spectrum as a comprehensive evaluation set for tracking VLM advancements in value-based tasks and for developing more sophisticated role-playing AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-modal Situated Reasoning in 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02389v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Situation awareness is essential for understanding and reasoning about 3D scenes in embodied AI agents. However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Efficient Transfer Learning for Video-language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11223v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models provide a robust foundation for efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional parameter modules to capture temporal information. While the increased model capacity brought by these additional parameters helps better fit the video-specific inductive biases, existing methods require learning a large number of parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of the original generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to improve the alignment between representations in the text and vision branches, achieving a balance between general knowledge and task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint. This constraint involves feeding template inputs (i.e., ``a video of $\{\textbf{cls}\}$'') into the trainable language branch, while LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions are input into the pre-trained language branch, enforcing consistency between the outputs of the two branches. This mechanism prevents over-fitting to downstream tasks and improves the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model.

| **[Exploiting VLM Localizability and Semantics for Open Vocabulary Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10922v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action detection aims to detect (recognize and localize) human actions spatially and temporally in videos. Existing approaches focus on the closed-set setting where an action detector is trained and tested on videos from a fixed set of action categories. However, this constrained setting is not viable in an open world where test videos inevitably come beyond the trained action categories. In this paper, we address the practical yet challenging Open-Vocabulary Action Detection (OVAD) problem. It aims to detect any action in test videos while training a model on a fixed set of action categories. To achieve such an open-vocabulary capability, we propose a novel method OpenMixer that exploits the inherent semantics and localizability of large vision-language models (VLM) within the family of query-based detection transformers (DETR). Specifically, the OpenMixer is developed by spatial and temporal OpenMixer blocks (S-OMB and T-OMB), and a dynamically fused alignment (DFA) module. The three components collectively enjoy the merits of strong generalization from pre-trained VLMs and end-to-end learning from DETR design. Moreover, we established OVAD benchmarks under various settings, and the experimental results show that the OpenMixer performs the best over baselines for detecting seen and unseen actions. We release the codes, models, and dataset splits at https://github.com/Cogito2012/OpenMixer.</p></details> | WACV 2025 Accepted |

Mpox (caused by the monkeypox virus) is a notable example of a zoonotic infection that often goes undiagnosed, especially as its rash progresses through stages, complicating detection across diverse populations with different presentations. In August 2024, the WHO Director-General declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern for a second time. Despite the deployment of deep learning techniques for detecting diseases from skin lesion images, a robust and publicly accessible foundation model for mpox diagnosis is still lacking due to the unavailability of open-source mpox skin lesion images, multimodal clinical data, and specialized training pipelines. To address this gap, we propose MpoxVLM, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to detect mpox by analyzing both skin lesion images and patient clinical information. MpoxVLM integrates the CLIP visual encoder, an enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier for skin lesions, and LLaMA-2-7B models, pre-trained and fine-tuned on visual instruction-following question-answer pairs from our newly released mpox skin lesion dataset. Our work achieves 90.38% accuracy for mpox detection, offering a promising pathway to improve early diagnostic accuracy in combating mpox.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ML4H 2024</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often rely on separate visual feature extractors and language processing models, which can be computationally intensive and limited in their ability to handle open-ended questions. In this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages a generative Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to streamline the RSVQA process. Our approach consists of a two-step training strategy: domain-adaptive pretraining and prompt-based finetuning. This method enables the LVLM to generate natural language answers by conditioning on both visual and textual inputs, without the need for predefined answer categories. We evaluate our model on the RSVQAxBEN dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a human evaluation study shows that our method produces answers that are more accurate, relevant, and fluent. The results highlight the potential of generative LVLMs in advancing the field of remote sensing analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, harsh weather creates challenges, and a pilot must have a clear view of runway elements before the minimum decision altitude. To aid in manual landing, a vision-based system trained to clear weather-induced visual degradations requires a robust landing dataset under various climatic conditions. Nevertheless, to acquire a dataset, flying an aircraft in dangerous weather impacts safety. Also, this system fails to generate reliable warnings, as localization of runway elements suffers from projective distortion while landing at crosswind. To combat, we propose to synthesize harsh weather landing images by training a prompt-based climatic diffusion network. Also, we optimize a weather distillation model using a novel diffusion-distillation loss to learn to clear these visual degradations. Precisely, the distillation model learns an inverse relationship with the diffusion network. Inference time, pre-trained distillation network directly clears weather-impacted onboard camera images, which can be further projected to display devices for improved visibility.Then, to tackle crosswind landing, a novel Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks (RuSTaN) module accurately warps landing images. It minimizes the localization error of runway object detector and helps generate reliable internal software warnings. Finally, we curated an aircraft landing dataset (AIRLAD) by simulating a landing scenario under various weather degradations and experimentally validated our contributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Indian Conference on Vision Graphics and Image Processing - ICVGIP 2024</p></details> |

To address the challenge of transferring features from known to unknown classes while mitigating model bias, we introduce GraphVL, a novel approach for vision-language modeling in GCD, leveraging CLIP. Our method integrates a graph convolutional network (GCN) with CLIP's text encoder to preserve class neighborhood structure. We also employ a lightweight visual projector for image data, ensuring discriminative features through margin-based contrastive losses for image-text mapping. This neighborhood preservation criterion effectively regulates the semantic space, making it less sensitive to known classes. Additionally, we learn textual prompts from known classes and align them to create a more contextually meaningful semantic feature space for the GCN layer using a contextual similarity loss. Finally, we represent unlabeled samples based on their semantic distance to class prompts from the GCN, enabling semi-supervised clustering for class discovery and minimizing errors. Our experiments on seven benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of GraphVL when integrated with the CLIP backbone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM ICVGIP 2024</p></details> |

Recent methods harness the powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) for 2D-to-3D knowledge distillation, achieving zero-shot 3D part segmentation. However, these methods are limited by their reliance on text prompts, which restricts the scalability to large-scale unlabeled datasets and the flexibility in handling part ambiguities. In this work, we introduce SAMPart3D, a scalable zero-shot 3D part segmentation framework that segments any 3D object into semantic parts at multiple granularities, without requiring predefined part label sets as text prompts. For scalability, we use text-agnostic vision foundation models to distill a 3D feature extraction backbone, allowing scaling to large unlabeled 3D datasets to learn rich 3D priors. For flexibility, we distill scale-conditioned part-aware 3D features for 3D part segmentation at multiple granularities. Once the segmented parts are obtained from the scale-conditioned part-aware 3D features, we use VLMs to assign semantic labels to each part based on the multi-view renderings. Compared to previous methods, our SAMPart3D can scale to the recent large-scale 3D object dataset Objaverse and handle complex, non-ordinary objects. Additionally, we contribute a new 3D part segmentation benchmark to address the lack of diversity and complexity of objects and parts in existing benchmarks. Experiments show that our SAMPart3D significantly outperforms existing zero-shot 3D part segmentation methods, and can facilitate various applications such as part-level editing and interactive segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yhyang-myron.github.io/SAMPart3D-website/</p></details> |

While current Vision Language Models (VLMs) show promise, they are prone to generating hallucinations, potentially compromising patient care. We introduce RadFlag, a black-box method to enhance the accuracy of radiology report generation. Our method uses a sampling-based flagging technique to find hallucinatory generations that should be removed. We first sample multiple reports at varying temperatures and then use a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify claims that are not consistently supported across samples, indicating that the model has low confidence in those claims. Using a calibrated threshold, we flag a fraction of these claims as likely hallucinations, which should undergo extra review or be automatically rejected. Our method achieves high precision when identifying both individual hallucinatory sentences and reports that contain hallucinations. As an easy-to-use, black-box system that only requires access to a model's temperature parameter, RadFlag is compatible with a wide range of radiology report generation models and has the potential to broadly improve the quality of automated radiology reporting.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

To address this, we propose Sim-CLIP, an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning method that enhances the robustness of the widely-used CLIP vision encoder against such attacks while maintaining semantic richness and specificity. By employing a Siamese architecture with cosine similarity loss, Sim-CLIP learns semantically meaningful and attack-resilient visual representations without requiring large batch sizes or momentum encoders. Our results demonstrate that VLMs enhanced with Sim-CLIP's fine-tuned CLIP encoder exhibit significantly enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks, while preserving semantic meaning of the perturbed images. Notably, Sim-CLIP does not require additional training or fine-tuning of the VLM itself; replacing the original vision encoder with our fine-tuned Sim-CLIP suffices to provide robustness. This work underscores the significance of reinforcing foundational models like CLIP to safeguard the reliability of downstream VLM applications, paving the way for more secure and effective multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

VeriGraph employs scene graphs as an intermediate representation, capturing key objects and spatial relationships to improve plan verification and refinement. The system generates a scene graph from input images and uses it to iteratively check and correct action sequences generated by an LLM-based task planner, ensuring constraints are respected and actions are executable. Our approach significantly enhances task completion rates across diverse manipulation scenarios, outperforming baseline methods by 58% for language-based tasks and 30% for image-based tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-o1, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-o1 independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-o1 to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-o1-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-o1 not only outperforms its base model by 8.9% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Q-VLM: Post-training Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08119v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework of large vision-language models (LVLMs) for efficient multi-modal inference. Conventional quantization methods sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by minimizing activation discretization errors, which fails to acquire optimal quantization strategy without considering cross-layer dependency. On the contrary, we mine the cross-layer dependency that significantly influences discretization errors of the entire vision-language model, and embed this dependency into optimal quantization strategy searching with low search cost. Specifically, we observe the strong correlation between the activation entropy and the cross-layer dependency concerning output discretization errors. Therefore, we employ the entropy as the proxy to partition blocks optimally, which aims to achieve satisfying trade-offs between discretization errors and the search cost. Moreover, we optimize the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained decomposition of search space, so that the search cost is further reduced without harming the quantization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method compresses the memory by 2.78x and increase generate speed by 1.44x about 13B LLaVA model without performance degradation on diverse multi-modal reasoning tasks.

| **[SEAGULL: No-reference Image Quality Assessment for Regions of Interest via Vision-Language Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10161v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods achieve remarkable success in analyzing quality for overall image, but few works explore quality analysis for Regions of Interest (ROIs). The quality analysis of ROIs can provide fine-grained guidance for image quality improvement and is crucial for scenarios focusing on region-level quality. This paper proposes a novel network, SEAGULL, which can SEe and Assess ROIs quality with GUidance from a Large vision-Language model. SEAGULL incorporates a vision-language model (VLM), masks generated by Segment Anything Model (SAM) to specify ROIs, and a meticulously designed Mask-based Feature Extractor (MFE) to extract global and local tokens for specified ROIs, enabling accurate fine-grained IQA for ROIs. Moreover, this paper constructs two ROI-based IQA datasets, SEAGULL-100w and SEAGULL-3k, for training and evaluating ROI-based IQA. SEAGULL-100w comprises about 100w synthetic distortion images with 33 million ROIs for pre-training to improve the model's ability of regional quality perception, and SEAGULL-3k contains about 3k authentic distortion ROIs to enhance the model's ability to perceive real world distortions. After pre-training on SEAGULL-100w and fine-tuning on SEAGULL-3k, SEAGULL shows remarkable performance on fine-grained ROI quality assessment. Code and datasets are publicly available at the https://github.com/chencn2020/Seagull.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Prompt Learning through an External Layer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19674v6)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning represents a promising method for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks by learning a set of text embeddings. One challenge inherent to these methods is the poor generalization performance due to the invalidity of the learned text embeddings for unseen tasks. A straightforward approach to bridge this gap is to freeze the text embeddings in prompts, which results in a lack of capacity to adapt VLMs for downstream tasks. To address this dilemma, we propose a paradigm called EnPrompt with a novel External Layer (EnLa). Specifically, we propose a textual external layer and learnable visual embeddings for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. The learnable external layer is built upon valid embeddings of pre-trained CLIP. This design considers the balance of learning capabilities between the two branches. To align the textual and visual features, we propose a novel two-pronged approach: i) we introduce the optimal transport as the discrepancy metric to align the vision and text modalities, and ii) we introduce a novel strengthening feature to enhance the interaction between these two modalities. Four representative experiments (i.e., base-to-novel generalization, few-shot learning, cross-dataset generalization, domain shifts generalization) across 15 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing prompt learning method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Domain Generalization via Prompt Learning and Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10063v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated domain generalization (FedDG) aims to improve the global model generalization in unseen domains by addressing data heterogeneity under privacy-preserving constraints. A common strategy in existing FedDG studies involves sharing domain-specific knowledge among clients, such as spectrum information, class prototypes, and data styles. However, this knowledge is extracted directly from local client samples, and sharing such sensitive information poses a potential risk of data leakage, which might not fully meet the requirements of FedDG. In this paper, we introduce prompt learning to adapt pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) in the FedDG scenario, and leverage locally learned prompts as a more secure bridge to facilitate knowledge transfer among clients. Specifically, we propose a novel FedDG framework through Prompt Learning and AggregatioN (PLAN), which comprises two training stages to collaboratively generate local prompts and global prompts at each federated round. First, each client performs both text and visual prompt learning using their own data, with local prompts indirectly synchronized by regarding the global prompts as a common reference. Second, all domain-specific local prompts are exchanged among clients and selectively aggregated into the global prompts using lightweight attention-based aggregators. The global prompts are finally applied to adapt VLMs to unseen target domains. As our PLAN framework requires training only a limited number of prompts and lightweight aggregators, it offers notable advantages in computational and communication efficiency for FedDG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization ability of PLAN across four benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks--techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multi-modal data has led current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which may lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel jailbreak method named IDEATOR, which autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is based on the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR uses a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability. Notably, it achieves a 94% success rate in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high success rates of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Meta's Chameleon, respectively. IDEATOR uncovers specific vulnerabilities in VLMs under black-box conditions, underscoring the need for improved safety mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Does Vision-Language Adaptation Impact the Safety of Vision Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07571v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language adaptation (VL adaptation) transforms Large Language Models (LLMs) into Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for multimodal tasks, but this process often compromises the inherent safety capabilities embedded in the original LLMs. Despite potential harmfulness due to weakened safety measures, in-depth analysis on the effects of VL adaptation on safety remains under-explored. This study examines how VL adaptation influences safety and evaluates the impact of safety fine-tuning methods. Our analysis reveals that safety degradation occurs during VL adaptation, even when the training data is safe. While safety tuning techniques like supervised fine-tuning with safety datasets or reinforcement learning from human feedback mitigate some risks, they still lead to safety degradation and a reduction in helpfulness due to over-rejection issues. Further analysis of internal model weights suggests that VL adaptation may impact certain safety-related layers, potentially lowering overall safety levels. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the objectives of VL adaptation and safety tuning are divergent, which often results in their simultaneous application being suboptimal. To address this, we suggest the weight merging approach as an optimal solution effectively reducing safety degradation while maintaining helpfulness. These insights help guide the development of more reliable and secure LVLMs for real-world applications.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

Recent advancements in large-scale vision-language models have significantly enhanced zero- and few-shot anomaly detection. However, these approaches may not fully leverage hierarchical features, potentially overlooking nuanced details crucial for accurate detection. To address this, we introduce a novel window self-attention mechanism based on the CLIP model, augmented with learnable prompts to process multi-level features within a Soldier-Officer Window Self-Attention (SOWA) framework. Our method has been rigorously evaluated on five benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance by leading in 18 out of 20 metrics, setting a new standard against existing state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Free Lunch in Pathology Foundation Model: Task-specific Model Adaptation with Concept-Guided Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09894v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis is gaining prominence within the medical imaging field. Recent advances in pathology foundation models have shown the potential to extract powerful feature representations from WSIs for downstream tasks. However, these foundation models are usually designed for general-purpose pathology image analysis and may not be optimal for specific downstream tasks or cancer types. In this work, we present Concept Anchor-guided Task-specific Feature Enhancement (CATE), an adaptable paradigm that can boost the expressivity and discriminativeness of pathology foundation models for specific downstream tasks. Based on a set of task-specific concepts derived from the pathology vision-language model with expert-designed prompts, we introduce two interconnected modules to dynamically calibrate the generic image features extracted by foundation models for certain tasks or cancer types. Specifically, we design a Concept-guided Information Bottleneck module to enhance task-relevant characteristics by maximizing the mutual information between image features and concept anchors while suppressing superfluous information. Moreover, a Concept-Feature Interference module is proposed to utilize the similarity between calibrated features and concept anchors to further generate discriminative task-specific features. The extensive experiments on public WSI datasets demonstrate that CATE significantly enhances the performance and generalizability of MIL models. Additionally, heatmap and umap visualization results also reveal the effectiveness and interpretability of CATE. The source code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CATE.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROCKET-1: Mastering Open-World Interaction with Visual-Temporal Context Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17856v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in multimodal tasks, but adapting them to embodied decision-making in open-world environments presents challenges. One critical issue is bridging the gap between discrete entities in low-level observations and the abstract concepts required for effective planning. A common solution is building hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language. However, language suffers from the inability to communicate detailed spatial information. We propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from past observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, supported by real-time object tracking from SAM-2. Our method unlocks the potential of VLMs, enabling them to tackle complex tasks that demand spatial reasoning. Experiments in Minecraft show that our approach enables agents to achieve previously unattainable tasks, with a $\mathbf{76}\%$ absolute improvement in open-world interaction performance. Codes and demos are now available on the project page: https://craftjarvis.github.io/ROCKET-1.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLV-FSR: Exploiting Large Language-Vision Prior for Face Super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09293v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing face super-resolution (FSR) methods have made significant advancements, but they primarily super-resolve face with limited visual information, original pixel-wise space in particular, commonly overlooking the pluralistic clues, like the higher-order depth and semantics, as well as non-visual inputs (text caption and description). Consequently, these methods struggle to produce a unified and meaningful representation from the input face. We suppose that introducing the language-vision pluralistic representation into unexplored potential embedding space could enhance FSR by encoding and exploiting the complementarity across language-vision prior. This motivates us to propose a new framework called LLV-FSR, which marries the power of large vision-language model and higher-order visual prior with the challenging task of FSR. Specifically, besides directly absorbing knowledge from original input, we introduce the pre-trained vision-language model to generate pluralistic priors, involving the image caption, descriptions, face semantic mask and depths. These priors are then employed to guide the more critical feature representation, facilitating realistic and high-quality face super-resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves both the reconstruction quality and perceptual quality, surpassing the SOTA by 0.43dB in terms of PSNR on the MMCelebA-HQ dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Category-Extensible Out-of-Distribution Detection via Hierarchical Context Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16725v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The key to OOD detection has two aspects: generalized feature representation and precise category description. Recently, vision-language models such as CLIP provide significant advances in both two issues, but constructing precise category descriptions is still in its infancy due to the absence of unseen categories. This work introduces two hierarchical contexts, namely perceptual context and spurious context, to carefully describe the precise category boundary through automatic prompt tuning. Specifically, perceptual contexts perceive the inter-category difference (e.g., cats vs apples) for current classification tasks, while spurious contexts further identify spurious (similar but exactly not) OOD samples for every single category (e.g., cats vs panthers, apples vs peaches). The two contexts hierarchically construct the precise description for a certain category, which is, first roughly classifying a sample to the predicted category and then delicately identifying whether it is truly an ID sample or actually OOD. Moreover, the precise descriptions for those categories within the vision-language framework present a novel application: CATegory-EXtensible OOD detection (CATEX). One can efficiently extend the set of recognizable categories by simply merging the hierarchical contexts learned under different sub-task settings. And extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate CATEX's effectiveness, robustness, and category-extensibility. For instance, CATEX consistently surpasses the rivals by a large margin with several protocols on the challenging ImageNet-1K dataset. In addition, we offer new insights on how to efficiently scale up the prompt engineering in vision-language models to recognize thousands of object categories, as well as how to incorporate large language models (like GPT-3) to boost zero-shot applications.

For example, to perform a high-level task like cleaning the table a robot must employ low-level capabilities of moving the effectors to the objects on the table, pick them up and then move them off the table one-by-one, while re-evaluating the consequently dynamic scenario in the process. Given that large vision language models (VLMs) have shown progress on many tasks that require high level, human-like reasoning, we ask the question: if the models are taught the requisite low-level capabilities, can they compose them in novel ways to achieve interesting high-level tasks like cleaning the table without having to be explicitly taught so? To this end, we present ClevrSkills - a benchmark suite for compositional reasoning in robotics. ClevrSkills is an environment suite developed on top of the ManiSkill2 simulator and an accompanying dataset. The dataset contains trajectories generated on a range of robotics tasks with language and visual annotations as well as multi-modal prompts as task specification. The suite includes a curriculum of tasks with three levels of compositional understanding, starting with simple tasks requiring basic motor skills. We benchmark multiple different VLM baselines on ClevrSkills and show that even after being pre-trained on large numbers of tasks, these models fail on compositional reasoning in robotics tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at NeurIPS 2024 (D&B track)</p></details> |

However, their deployment in multi-robot systems remains fragmented and struggles to handle complex task dependencies and parallel execution. This study introduces the DART-LLM (Dependency-Aware Multi-Robot Task Decomposition and Execution using Large Language Models) system, designed to address these challenges. DART-LLM utilizes LLMs to parse natural language instructions, decomposing them into multiple subtasks with dependencies to establish complex task sequences, thereby enhancing efficient coordination and parallel execution in multi-robot systems. The system includes the QA LLM module, Breakdown Function modules, Actuation module, and a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based object detection module, enabling task decomposition and execution from natural language instructions to robotic actions. Experimental results demonstrate that DART-LLM excels in handling long-horizon tasks and collaborative tasks with complex dependencies. Even when using smaller models like Llama 3.1 8B, the system achieves good performance, highlighting DART-LLM's robustness in terms of model size.

| **[Bridging the Visual Gap: Fine-Tuning Multimodal Models with Knowledge-Adapted Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09018v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research increasingly focuses on training vision-language models (VLMs) with long, detailed image captions. However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We will release our code and models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Limited Impact of Medical Adaptation of Large Language and Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08870v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several recent works seek to develop foundation models specifically for medical applications, adapting general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) via continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare ten public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical question-answering (QA). For instance, across all tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 22.7% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 36.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 40.5% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions. Meanwhile, we find that after fine-tuning on specific QA tasks, medical LLMs can show performance improvements, but the benefits do not carry over to tasks based on clinical notes. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of EMNLP 2024 paper arXiv:2411.04118.

Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) such as LLaVA mostly employ heterogeneous architectures that connect pre-trained visual encoders with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate visual recognition and complex reasoning. Although achieving remarkable performance with relatively lightweight training, we identify four primary scalability limitations: (1) The visual capacity is constrained by pre-trained visual encoders, which are typically an order of magnitude smaller than LLMs. (2) The heterogeneous architecture complicates the use of established hardware and software infrastructure. (3) Study of scaling laws on such architecture must consider three separate components - visual encoder, connector, and LLMs, which complicates the analysis. (4) The use of existing visual encoders typically requires following a pre-defined specification of image inputs pre-processing, for example, by reshaping inputs to fixed-resolution square images, which presents difficulties in processing and training on high-resolution images or those with unusual aspect ratio. A unified single Transformer architecture, like SOLO, effectively addresses these scalability concerns in LVLMs; however, its limited adoption in the modern context likely stems from the absence of reliable training recipes that balance both modalities and ensure stable training for billion-scale models. In this paper, we introduce the first open-source training recipe for developing SOLO, an open-source 7B LVLM using moderate academic resources. The training recipe involves initializing from LLMs, sequential pre-training on ImageNet and web-scale data, and instruction fine-tuning on our curated high-quality datasets. On extensive evaluation, SOLO demonstrates performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5-7B, particularly excelling in visual mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

In this paper, we discuss how generalist robot policies (i.e., robot foundation models) can address these challenges, and how we can design effective generalist robot policies for complex and highly dexterous tasks. We propose a novel flow matching architecture built on top of a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to inherit Internet-scale semantic knowledge. We then discuss how this model can be trained on a large and diverse dataset from multiple dexterous robot platforms, including single-arm robots, dual-arm robots, and mobile manipulators.

However, despite advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their increasing use in video analysis, extracting user actions from desktop recordings remains an underexplored area. This paper addresses this gap by proposing two novel VLM-based methods for user action extraction: the Direct Frame-Based Approach (DF), which inputs sampled frames directly into VLMs, and the Differential Frame-Based Approach (DiffF), which incorporates explicit frame differences detected via computer vision techniques. We evaluate these methods using a basic self-curated dataset and an advanced benchmark adapted from prior work. Our results show that the DF approach achieves an accuracy of 70% to 80% in identifying user actions, with the extracted action sequences being re-playable though Robotic Process Automation. We find that while VLMs show potential, incorporating explicit UI changes can degrade performance, making the DF approach more reliable. This work represents the first application of VLMs for extracting user action sequences from desktop recordings, contributing new methods, benchmarks, and insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Voxeland: Probabilistic Instance-Aware Semantic Mapping with Evidence-based Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08727v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots in human-centered environments require accurate scene understanding to perform high-level tasks effectively. This understanding can be achieved through instance-aware semantic mapping, which involves reconstructing elements at the level of individual instances. Neural networks, the de facto solution for scene understanding, still face limitations such as overconfident incorrect predictions with out-of-distribution objects or generating inaccurate masks.Placing excessive reliance on these predictions makes the reconstruction susceptible to errors, reducing the robustness of the resulting maps and hampering robot operation. In this work, we propose Voxeland, a probabilistic framework for incrementally building instance-aware semantic maps. Inspired by the Theory of Evidence, Voxeland treats neural network predictions as subjective opinions regarding map instances at both geometric and semantic levels. These opinions are aggregated over time to form evidences, which are formalized through a probabilistic model. This enables us to quantify uncertainty in the reconstruction process, facilitating the identification of map areas requiring improvement (e.g. reobservation or reclassification). As one strategy to exploit this, we incorporate a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to perform semantic level disambiguation for instances with high uncertainty. Results from the standard benchmarking on the publicly available SceneNN dataset demonstrate that Voxeland outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the benefits of incorporating and leveraging both instance- and semantic-level uncertainties to enhance reconstruction robustness. This is further validated through qualitative experiments conducted on the real-world ScanNet dataset.</p></details> |  |

Current strategies aim to address this challenge through different domain generalization techniques, yet they have had limited success due to the risk of overfitting when solely relying on value labels for regression. Recent progress in pre-trained vision-language models has motivated us to capitalize on the abundant semantic information available. We propose a novel approach in this paper, reframing the gaze estimation task as a vision-language alignment issue. Our proposed framework, named Language-Guided Gaze Estimation (LG-Gaze), learns continuous and geometry-sensitive features for gaze estimation benefit from the rich prior knowledges of vision-language models. Specifically, LG-Gaze aligns gaze features with continuous linguistic features through our proposed multimodal contrastive regression loss, which customizes adaptive weights for different negative samples. Furthermore, to better adapt to the labels for gaze estimation task, we propose a geometry-aware interpolation method to obtain more precise gaze embeddings. Through extensive experiments, we validate the efficacy of our framework in four different cross-domain evaluation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Most existing VLN methods focus on indoor ground robot scenarios. However, when applied to UAV VLN in outdoor urban scenes, it faces two significant challenges. First, urban scenes contain numerous objects, which makes it challenging to match fine-grained landmarks in images with complex textual descriptions of these landmarks. Second, overall environmental information encompasses multiple modal dimensions, and the diversity of representations significantly increases the complexity of the encoding process. To address these challenges, we propose NavAgent, the first urban UAV embodied navigation model driven by a large Vision-Language Model. NavAgent undertakes navigation tasks by synthesizing multi-scale environmental information, including topological maps (global), panoramas (medium), and fine-grained landmarks (local). Specifically, we utilize GLIP to build a visual recognizer for landmark capable of identifying and linguisticizing fine-grained landmarks. Subsequently, we develop dynamically growing scene topology map that integrate environmental information and employ Graph Convolutional Networks to encode global environmental data. In addition, to train the visual recognizer for landmark, we develop NavAgent-Landmark2K, the first fine-grained landmark dataset for real urban street scenes. In experiments conducted on the Touchdown and Map2seq datasets, NavAgent outperforms strong baseline models. The code and dataset will be released to the community to facilitate the exploration and development of outdoor VLN.</p></details> |  |

The model introduces an innovative object-aware prompting strategy that significantly enhances its capability in handling long-tail data. Experiments on the standard COCO dataset demonstrate that ViTOC outperforms baseline models across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, we propose a reference-free evaluation method based on CLIP to further validate the model's effectiveness. By utilizing pretrained visual model parameters, ViTOC achieves efficient end-to-end training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Pre-trained Models for FF-to-FFPE Histopathological Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18054v3)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The two primary types of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) slides in histopathology are Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) and Fresh Frozen (FF). FFPE slides offer high quality histopathological images but require a labor-intensive acquisition process. In contrast, FF slides can be prepared quickly, but the image quality is relatively poor. Our task is to translate FF images into FFPE style, thereby improving the image quality for diagnostic purposes. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-FFPE, a method for FF-to-FFPE histopathological image translation using a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, we utilize a one-step diffusion model as the generator, which we fine-tune using LoRA adapters within an adversarial learning framework. To enable the model to effectively capture both global structural patterns and local details, we introduce a multi-scale feature fusion module that leverages two VAE encoders to extract features at different image resolutions, performing feature fusion before inputting them into the UNet. Additionally, a pre-trained vision-language model for histopathology serves as the backbone for the discriminator, enhancing model performance. Our FF-to-FFPE translation experiments on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods. The code and models are released at https://github.com/QilaiZhang/Diffusion-FFPE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE BIBM 2024</p></details> |

Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs), comprising a visual encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM) decoder, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in such reasoning tasks. This prompts a crucial question: have VLMs effectively tackled the CR challenge? We conjecture that existing CR benchmarks may not adequately push the boundaries of modern VLMs due to the reliance on an LLM-only negative text generation pipeline. Consequently, the negatives produced either appear as outliers from the natural language distribution learned by VLMs' LLM decoders or as improbable within the corresponding image context. To address these limitations, we introduce ConMe -- a compositional reasoning benchmark and a novel data generation pipeline leveraging VLMs to produce `hard CR Q&A'. Through a new concept of VLMs conversing with each other to collaboratively expose their weaknesses, our pipeline autonomously generates, evaluates, and selects challenging compositional reasoning questions, establishing a robust CR benchmark, also subsequently validated manually. Our benchmark provokes a noteworthy, up to 33%, decrease in CR performance compared to preceding benchmarks, reinstating the CR challenge even for state-of-the-art VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Camera Ready</p></details> |

Despite their impressive capabilities, these models cannot currently be directly applied to challenging robot manipulation problems that require complex and precise continuous reasoning. Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) systems can control high-dimensional continuous systems over long horizons through combining traditional primitive robot operations. However, these systems require detailed model of how the robot can impact its environment, preventing them from directly interpreting and addressing novel human objectives, for example, an arbitrary natural language goal. We propose deploying VLMs within TAMP systems by having them generate discrete and continuous language-parameterized constraints that enable TAMP to reason about open-world concepts. Specifically, we propose algorithms for VLM partial planning that constrain a TAMP system's discrete temporal search and VLM continuous constraints interpretation to augment the traditional manipulation constraints that TAMP systems seek to satisfy. We demonstrate our approach on two robot embodiments, including a real world robot, across several manipulation tasks, where the desired objectives are conveyed solely through language.</p></details> |  |

JanusFlow introduces a minimalist architecture that integrates autoregressive language models with rectified flow, a state-of-the-art method in generative modeling. Our key finding demonstrates that rectified flow can be straightforwardly trained within the large language model framework, eliminating the need for complex architectural modifications. To further improve the performance of our unified model, we adopt two key strategies: (i) decoupling the understanding and generation encoders, and (ii) aligning their representations during unified training. Extensive experiments show that JanusFlow achieves comparable or superior performance to specialized models in their respective domains, while significantly outperforming existing unified approaches across standard benchmarks. This work represents a step toward more efficient and versatile vision-language models.</p></details> |  |

However, a significant research gap exists in the neuroimaging field, especially for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, due to the lack of comprehensive diagnostic reports that can be utilized for model fine-tuning. This paper addresses this gap by generating synthetic diagnostic reports using GPT-4o-mini on structured data from the OASIS-4 dataset, which comprises 663 patients. Using the synthetic reports as ground truth for training and validation, we then generated neurological reports directly from the images in the dataset leveraging the pre-trained BiomedCLIP and T5 models.

Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience.

Our objective is to optimize for a set of high-quality data samples that cover a highly diverse and rich set of multimodal tasks, while enabling cost-effective and accurate model evaluation. In particular, we collected 505 realistic tasks encompassing over 8,000 samples from 16 expert annotators to extensively cover the multimodal task space. Instead of unifying these problems into standard multi-choice questions (like MMMU, MMBench, and MMT-Bench), we embrace a wide range of output formats like numbers, phrases, code, \LaTeX, coordinates, JSON, free-form, etc. To accommodate these formats, we developed over 40 metrics to evaluate these tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks, MEGA-Bench offers a fine-grained capability report across multiple dimensions (e.g., application, input type, output format, skill), allowing users to interact with and visualize model capabilities in depth. We evaluate a wide variety of frontier vision-language models on MEGA-Bench to understand their capabilities across these dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

| **[Revisiting the Adversarial Robustness of Vision Language Models: a Multimodal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19287v3)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit exceptional generalization across diverse downstream tasks. While recent studies reveal their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, research to date has primarily focused on enhancing the robustness of image encoders against image-based attacks, with defenses against text-based and multimodal attacks remaining largely unexplored. To this end, this work presents the first comprehensive study on improving the adversarial robustness of VLMs against attacks targeting image, text, and multimodal inputs. This is achieved by proposing multimodal contrastive adversarial training (MMCoA). Such an approach strengthens the robustness of both image and text encoders by aligning the clean text embeddings with adversarial image embeddings, and adversarial text embeddings with clean image embeddings. The robustness of the proposed MMCoA is examined against existing defense methods over image, text, and multimodal attacks on the CLIP model. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets across two tasks reveal the characteristics of different adversarial defense methods under distinct distribution shifts and dataset complexities across the three attack types. This paves the way for a unified framework of adversarial robustness against different modality attacks, opening up new possibilities for securing VLMs against multimodal attacks.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution: leveraging intra-domain category-aware prototypes for ODCL in CLIP (DPeCLIP), where the prototype is the key to bridging the above two processes. Concretely, we propose a training-free Task-ID discriminator method, by utilizing prototypes as classifiers for identifying Task-IDs. Furthermore, to maintain the knowledge corresponding to each domain, we incorporate intra-domain category-aware prototypes as domain prior prompts into the training process. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 2.37% and 1.14% average improvement in class-incremental and task-incremental settings, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly in single-page document understanding (DU). However, their abilities on long-context DU remain an open problem. This work presents MMLongBench-Doc, a long-context, multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,062 expert-annotated questions. Distinct from previous datasets, it is constructed upon 130 lengthy PDF-formatted documents with an average of 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens. Towards comprehensive evaluation, answers to these questions rely on pieces of evidence from (1) different sources (text, image, chart, table, and layout structure) and (2) various locations (i.e. page number). Moreover, 33.2% of the questions are cross-page questions requiring evidence across multiple pages. 22.8% of the questions are designed to be unanswerable for detecting potential hallucinations. Experiments on 14 LVLMs demonstrate that long-context DU greatly challenges current models. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an F1 score of only 42.7%, while the second-best, GPT-4V, scores 31.4%. Furthermore, 12 LVLMs (all except GPT-4o and GPT-4V) even present worse performance than their LLM counterparts which are fed with lossy-parsed OCR documents. These results validate the necessity of future research toward more capable long-context LVLMs. Project Page: https://mayubo2333.github.io/MMLongBench-Doc</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[ReKep: Spatio-Temporal Reasoning of Relational Keypoint Constraints for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01652v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing robotic manipulation tasks as constraints that associate the robot and the environment is a promising way to encode desired robot behaviors. However, it remains unclear how to formulate the constraints such that they are 1) versatile to diverse tasks, 2) free of manual labeling, and 3) optimizable by off-the-shelf solvers to produce robot actions in real-time. In this work, we introduce Relational Keypoint Constraints (ReKep), a visually-grounded representation for constraints in robotic manipulation. Specifically, ReKep is expressed as Python functions mapping a set of 3D keypoints in the environment to a numerical cost. We demonstrate that by representing a manipulation task as a sequence of Relational Keypoint Constraints, we can employ a hierarchical optimization procedure to solve for robot actions (represented by a sequence of end-effector poses in SE(3)) with a perception-action loop at a real-time frequency. Furthermore, in order to circumvent the need for manual specification of ReKep for each new task, we devise an automated procedure that leverages large vision models and vision-language models to produce ReKep from free-form language instructions and RGB-D observations. We present system implementations on a wheeled single-arm platform and a stationary dual-arm platform that can perform a large variety of manipulation tasks, featuring multi-stage, in-the-wild, bimanual, and reactive behaviors, all without task-specific data or environment models.

Our two-stage approach leverages large vision-language models and language models to create knowledge-augmented captions, which are then used to train a specialized VLM for scaling up the dataset. We train vision-language models on KALE and demonstrate improvements on vision-language tasks. Our experiments show the utility of KALE for training more capable and knowledgeable multimodal models.

INQUIRE includes iNaturalist 2024 (iNat24), a new dataset of five million natural world images, along with 250 expert-level retrieval queries. These queries are paired with all relevant images comprehensively labeled within iNat24, comprising 33,000 total matches. Queries span categories such as species identification, context, behavior, and appearance, emphasizing tasks that require nuanced image understanding and domain expertise. Our benchmark evaluates two core retrieval tasks: (1) INQUIRE-Fullrank, a full dataset ranking task, and (2) INQUIRE-Rerank, a reranking task for refining top-100 retrievals. Detailed evaluation of a range of recent multimodal models demonstrates that INQUIRE poses a significant challenge, with the best models failing to achieve an mAP@50 above 50%. In addition, we show that reranking with more powerful multimodal models can enhance retrieval performance, yet there remains a significant margin for improvement. By focusing on scientifically-motivated ecological challenges, INQUIRE aims to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and the needs of real-world scientific inquiry, encouraging the development of retrieval systems that can assist with accelerating ecological and biodiversity research.

| **[StoryTeller: Improving Long Video Description through Global Audio-Visual Character Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07076v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are largely limited to processing short, seconds-long videos and struggle with generating coherent descriptions for extended video spanning minutes or more. Long video description introduces new challenges, such as plot-level consistency across descriptions. To address these, we figure out audio-visual character identification, matching character names to each dialogue, as a key factor. We propose StoryTeller, a system for generating dense descriptions of long videos, incorporating both low-level visual concepts and high-level plot information. StoryTeller uses a multimodal large language model that integrates visual, audio, and text modalities to perform audio-visual character identification on minute-long video clips. The results are then fed into a LVLM to enhance consistency of video description. We validate our approach on movie description tasks and introduce MovieStory101, a dataset with dense descriptions for three-minute movie clips. To evaluate long video descriptions, we create MovieQA, a large set of multiple-choice questions for the MovieStory101 test set. We assess descriptions by inputting them into GPT-4 to answer these questions, using accuracy as an automatic evaluation metric. Experiments show that StoryTeller outperforms all open and closed-source baselines on MovieQA, achieving 9.5% higher accuracy than the strongest baseline, Gemini-1.5-pro, and demonstrating a +15.56% advantage in human side-by-side evaluations. Additionally, incorporating audio-visual character identification from StoryTeller improves the performance of all video description models, with Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o showing relative improvement of 5.5% and 13.0%, respectively, in accuracy on MovieQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept Drift and Long-Tailed Distribution in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization: Benchmark and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02346v2)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data is the foundation for the development of computer vision, and the establishment of datasets plays an important role in advancing the techniques of fine-grained visual categorization~(FGVC). In the existing FGVC datasets used in computer vision, it is generally assumed that each collected instance has fixed characteristics and the distribution of different categories is relatively balanced. In contrast, the real world scenario reveals the fact that the characteristics of instances tend to vary with time and exhibit a long-tailed distribution. Hence, the collected datasets may mislead the optimization of the fine-grained classifiers, resulting in unpleasant performance in real applications. Starting from the real-world conditions and to promote the practical progress of fine-grained visual categorization, we present a Concept Drift and Long-Tailed Distribution dataset. Specifically, the dataset is collected by gathering 11195 images of 250 instances in different species for 47 consecutive months in their natural contexts. The collection process involves dozens of crowd workers for photographing and domain experts for labeling. Meanwhile, we propose a feature recombination framework to address the learning challenges associated with CDLT. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our method while also highlighting the limitations of popular large vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in the context of long-tailed distributions. This emphasizes the significance of CDLT as a benchmark for investigating these challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[UMFC: Unsupervised Multi-Domain Feature Calibration for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06921v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown powerful zero-shot transfer capabilities. But they still struggle with domain shifts and typically require labeled data to adapt to downstream tasks, which could be costly. In this work, we aim to leverage unlabeled data that naturally spans multiple domains to enhance the transferability of vision-language models. Under this unsupervised multi-domain setting, we have identified inherent model bias within CLIP, notably in its visual and text encoders. Specifically, we observe that CLIP's visual encoder tends to prioritize encoding domain over discriminative category information, meanwhile its text encoder exhibits a preference for domain-relevant classes. To mitigate this model bias, we propose a training-free and label-free feature calibration method, Unsupervised Multi-domain Feature Calibration (UMFC). UMFC estimates image-level biases from domain-specific features and text-level biases from the direction of domain transition. These biases are subsequently subtracted from original image and text features separately, to render them domain-invariant. We evaluate our method on multiple settings including transductive learning and test-time adaptation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms CLIP and performs on par with the state-of-the-arts that need additional annotations or optimization. Our code is available at https://github.com/GIT-LJc/UMFC.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

To date, most of the existing approaches are confined to single-task adaptation, whereas the requirements in real-world scenarios are inherently varied and continually evolving. Thus an ideal LVLM should sustain continual instruction tuning in the face of stream-task distributions (i.e., different domains, emerging capabilities, and new datasets) while minimizing the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a new benchmark for COntinuAl inStruction Tuning on LVLMs (COAST), which encompasses the aforementioned domain-incremental, capability-incremental, and dataset-incremental configurations. In terms of methodology, we propose Continual LLaVA, a rehearsal-free method tailored for continual instruction tuning in LVLMs. To circumvent the additional overhead associated with experience replay, we freeze LVLMs and construct the dual increment embeddings for each input instruction to facilitate parameter-efficient tuning. Specifically, the increment embeddings can be decomposed into two principal components: 1) intrinsic increment embeddings to encode task-specific characteristics. To achieve this, we set up a low-rank pool containing candidate embeddings, from which we select the relevant ones based on their similarity with the user instructions; 2) contextual increment embeddings to investigate the inter-dependencies across tasks. In this regard, the low-rank embeddings chosen in the previous tasks are aggregated via learnable weighted sum to provide complementary hints. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed Continual LLaVA outperforms previous methods by significantly reducing the forgetting during the continual instruction tuning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Stage Knowledge Integration of Vision-Language Models for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06764v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large-scale image-text datasets, enable zero-shot predictions for unseen data but may underperform on specific unseen tasks. Continual learning (CL) can help VLMs effectively adapt to new data distributions without joint training, but faces challenges of catastrophic forgetting and generalization forgetting. Although significant progress has been achieved by distillation-based methods, they exhibit two severe limitations. One is the popularly adopted single-teacher paradigm fails to impart comprehensive knowledge, The other is the existing methods inadequately leverage the multimodal information in the original training dataset, instead they rely on additional data for distillation, which increases computational and storage overhead. To mitigate both limitations, by drawing on Knowledge Integration Theory (KIT), we propose a Multi-Stage Knowledge Integration network (MulKI) to emulate the human learning process in distillation methods. MulKI achieves this through four stages, including Eliciting Ideas, Adding New Ideas, Distinguishing Ideas, and Making Connections. During the four stages, we first leverage prototypes to align across modalities, eliciting cross-modal knowledge, then adding new knowledge by constructing fine-grained intra- and inter-modality relationships with prototypes. After that, knowledge from two teacher models is adaptively distinguished and re-weighted. Finally, we connect between models from intra- and inter-task, integrating preceding and new knowledge. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in maintaining zero-shot capabilities while supporting continual learning across diverse downstream tasks, showcasing its potential in adapting VLMs to evolving data distributions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Semantic Enhancement for Object SLAM (SEO-SLAM), a novel SLAM system that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance object-level semantic mapping in such environments. SEO-SLAM tackles existing challenges by (1) generating more specific and descriptive open-vocabulary object labels using MLLMs, (2) simultaneously correcting factors causing erroneous landmarks, and (3) dynamically updating a multiclass confusion matrix to mitigate object detector biases. Our approach enables more precise distinctions between similar objects and maintains map coherence by reflecting scene changes through MLLM feedback. We evaluate SEO-SLAM on our challenging dataset, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and robustness in environments with multiple similar objects. Our system outperforms existing approaches in terms of landmark matching accuracy and semantic consistency. Results show the feedback from MLLM improves object-centric semantic mapping.

| **[Enhancing Visual Classification using Comparative Descriptors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05357v2)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, in visual classification tasks, has been enhanced by leveraging semantic knowledge from large language models (LLMs), including GPT. Recent studies have shown that in zero-shot classification tasks, descriptors incorporating additional cues, high-level concepts, or even random characters often outperform those using only the category name. In many classification tasks, while the top-1 accuracy may be relatively low, the top-5 accuracy is often significantly higher. This gap implies that most misclassifications occur among a few similar classes, highlighting the model's difficulty in distinguishing between classes with subtle differences. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel concept of comparative descriptors. These descriptors emphasize the unique features of a target class against its most similar classes, enhancing differentiation. By generating and integrating these comparative descriptors into the classification framework, we refine the semantic focus and improve classification accuracy. An additional filtering process ensures that these descriptors are closer to the image embeddings in the CLIP space, further enhancing performance. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness in visual classification tasks by addressing the specific challenge of subtle inter-class differences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025</p></details> |

Unfortunately, the literature still leaves open a number of questions related to best practices in designing and training such models. In this paper we seek to answer several questions related to the pretraining of vision-language encoders through meta-analysis. In our first set of experiments, we show that we can save significant compute at no cost to downstream performance, by freezing large parts of vision-language models during pretraining. In our second set of experiments we examine the effect of basing a VL transformer on a vision model versus a text model.

While recent research suggests that current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit more reliance on shape, we find them to still be seriously limited in this regard. To quantify such limitations, we introduce IllusionBench, a dataset that challenges current cutting-edge VLMs to decipher shape information when the shape is represented by an arrangement of visual elements in a scene. Our extensive evaluations reveal that, while these shapes are easily detectable by human annotators, current VLMs struggle to recognize them, indicating important avenues for future work in developing more robust visual perception systems.

| **[Aquila-plus: Prompt-Driven Visual-Language Models for Pixel-Level Remote Sensing Image Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06142v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of vision language models (VLMs) has led to significant advances in visual-language integration through visual instruction tuning, and they have rapidly evolved in the field of remote sensing image understanding, demonstrating their powerful capabilities. However, existing RSVLMs mainly focus on image-level or frame-level understanding, making it difficult to achieve fine-grained pixel-level visual-language alignment. Additionally, the lack of mask-based instructional data limits their further development. In this paper, we propose a mask-text instruction tuning method called Aquila-plus, which extends the capabilities of RSVLMs to achieve pixel-level visual understanding by incorporating fine-grained mask regions into language instructions. To achieve this, we first meticulously constructed a mask region-text dataset containing 100K samples, and then designed a visual-language model by injecting pixel-level representations into a large language model (LLM). Specifically, Aquila-plus uses a convolutional CLIP as the visual encoder and employs a mask-aware visual extractor to extract precise visual mask features from high-resolution inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that Aquila-plus outperforms existing methods in various region understanding tasks, showcasing its novel capabilities in pixel-level instruction tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aquila: A Hierarchically Aligned Visual-Language Model for Enhanced Remote Sensing Image Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06074v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large vision language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual language capabilities through visual instruction tuning, showing great promise in the field of remote sensing image interpretation. However, existing remote sensing vision language models (RSVLMs) often fall short in capturing the complex characteristics of remote sensing scenes, as they typically rely on low resolution, single scale visual features and simplistic methods to map visual features to language features. In this paper, we present Aquila, an advanced visual language foundation model designed to enable richer visual feature representation and more precise visual-language feature alignment for remote sensing images. Our approach introduces a learnable Hierarchical Spatial Feature Integration (SFI) module that supports high resolution image inputs and aggregates multi scale visual features, allowing for the detailed representation of complex visual information. Additionally, the SFI module is repeatedly integrated into the layers of the large language model (LLM) to achieve deep visual language feature alignment, without compromising the model's performance in natural language processing tasks. These innovations, capturing detailed visual effects through higher resolution and multi scale input, and enhancing feature alignment significantly improve the model's ability to learn from image text data. We validate the effectiveness of Aquila through extensive quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GlocalCLIP: Object-agnostic Global-Local Prompt Learning for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06071v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) is crucial for detecting abnormal patterns in target datasets without using training samples, specifically in scenarios where there are distributional differences between the target domain and training data or where data scarcity arises because of restricted access. Although recently pretrained vision-language models demonstrate strong zero-shot performance across various visual tasks, they focus on learning class semantics, which makes their direct application to ZSAD challenging. To address this scenario, we propose GlocalCLIP, which uniquely separates global and local prompts and jointly optimizes them. This approach enables the object-agnostic glocal semantic prompt design to effectively capture general normal and anomalous patterns without dependency on specific objects in the image. We refine the text prompts for more precise adjustments by utilizing deep-text prompt tuning in the text encoder. In the vision encoder, we apply V-V attention layers to capture detailed local image features. Finally, we introduce glocal contrastive learning to improve the complementary learning of global and local prompts, effectively detecting abnormal patterns across various domains. The generalization performance of GlocalCLIP in ZSAD was demonstrated on 15 real-world datasets from both the industrial and medical domains, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 28 pages, 33 figures |
| **[Emotional Images: Assessing Emotions in Images and Potential Biases in Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05985v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines potential biases and inconsistencies in emotional evocation of images produced by generative artificial intelligence (AI) models and their potential bias toward negative emotions. In particular, we assess this bias by comparing the emotions evoked by an AI-produced image to the emotions evoked by prompts used to create those images. As a first step, the study evaluates three approaches for identifying emotions in images -- traditional supervised learning, zero-shot learning with vision-language models, and cross-modal auto-captioning -- using EmoSet, a large dataset of image-emotion annotations that categorizes images across eight emotional types. Results show fine-tuned models, particularly Google's Vision Transformer (ViT), significantly outperform zero-shot and caption-based methods in recognizing emotions in images. For a cross-modality comparison, we then analyze the differences between emotions in text prompts -- via existing text-based emotion-recognition models -- and the emotions evoked in the resulting images. Findings indicate that AI-generated images frequently lean toward negative emotional content, regardless of the original prompt. This emotional skew in generative models could amplify negative affective content in digital spaces, perpetuating its prevalence and impact. The study advocates for a multidisciplinary approach to better align AI emotion recognition with psychological insights and address potential biases in generative AI outputs across digital media.</p></details> |  |

However, this cloud-only approach underutilizes edge computational resources and requires significant bandwidth for transmitting raw images. In this paper, we introduce an edge-cloud collaborative VQA system, called LLaVA-AlignedVQ, which features a novel Aligned Vector Quantization algorithm (AlignedVQ) that efficiently compress intermediate features without compromising accuracy to support partitioned execution. Our experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-AlignedVQ achieves approximately 1365x compression rate of intermediate features, reducing data transmission overhead by 96.8% compared to transmitting JPEG90-compressed images to the cloud. LLaVA-AlignedVQ achieves an inference speedup of 2-15x while maintaining high accuracy, remaining within -2.23% to +1.6% of the original model's accuracy performance across eight VQA datasets, compared to the cloud-only solution.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

In contrast to prior work, we do not rely on a separation between perception, planning, and control; instead, we use a VLM to directly select actions in one step. Surprisingly, we find that a VLM can be used as an end-to-end policy zero-shot, i.e., without any fine-tuning or exposure to navigation data. This makes our approach open-ended and generalizable to any downstream navigation task. We run an extensive study to evaluate the performance of our approach in comparison to baseline prompting methods. In addition, we perform a design analysis to understand the most impactful design decisions.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Poze, an innovative video processing framework that provides feedback on human motion, emulating the insights of a professional coach. Poze combines pose estimation with sequence comparison and is optimized to function effectively with minimal data.

| **[HPE-CogVLM: Advancing Vision Language Models with a Head Pose Grounding Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01914v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Head pose estimation (HPE) requires a sophisticated understanding of 3D spatial relationships to generate precise yaw, pitch, and roll angles. Previous HPE models, primarily CNN-based, rely on cropped close-up human head images as inputs and often lack robustness in real-world scenario. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can analyze entire images while focusing on specific objects through their attention mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to improve the HPE accuracy by leveraging the object detection grounding capability of a VLM, referred to as CogVLM. We empirically find that directly LoRA fine-tuning of this VLM for the HPE task fails to achieve desirable HPE accuracy, while some model merging methods can improve accuracy but frequently produce blended invalid response formats, struggling to handle both object detection and HPE tasks simultaneously. To integrate HPE capability into CogVLM effectively, we develop a novel LoRA layer-based model merging method. This merging approach applies a high cosine similarity threshold and a winner-takes-all layer selection strategy, aligning attention to the HPE task while preserving original object detection knowledge. It successfully resolves issues with blended invalid response formats and improves accuracy. Results show that our HPE-CogVLM achieves a 31.5\% reduction in Mean Absolute Error over the current state-of-the-art CNN model, 6DRepNet, in cross-dataset evaluation. Furthermore, HPE-CogVLM outperforms both directly LoRA fine-tuned and task arithmetic-based merged VLMs across all HPE metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Vision-Language Few-Shot Adaptation with Negative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12964v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive zero-shot performance and transferability, allowing them to adapt to downstream tasks in a data-efficient manner. However, when only a few labeled samples are available, adapting VLMs to distinguish subtle differences between similar classes in specific downstream tasks remains challenging. In this work, we propose a Simple yet effective Negative Learning approach, SimNL, to more efficiently exploit the task-specific knowledge from few-shot labeled samples. Unlike previous methods that focus on identifying a set of representative positive features defining "what is a {CLASS}", SimNL discovers a complementary set of negative features that define "what is not a {CLASS}", providing additional insights that supplement the positive features to enhance task-specific recognition capability. Further, we identify that current adaptation approaches are particularly vulnerable to potential noise in the few-shot sample set. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play few-shot instance reweighting technique to suppress noisy outliers and amplify clean samples for more stable adaptation. Our extensive experimental results across 15 datasets validate that the proposed SimNL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on both few-shot learning and domain generalization tasks while achieving competitive computational efficiency.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) offer inherent interpretability by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of human-understandable concepts. However, this inherent interpretability comes at the cost of greater annotation burden. Additionally, adding new concepts requires retraining the entire system. In this work, we introduce a novel two-step methodology that addresses both of these challenges. By simulating the two stages of a CBM, we utilize a pretrained Vision Language Model (VLM) to automatically predict clinical concepts, and a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate disease diagnoses based on the predicted concepts. We validate our approach on three skin lesion datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms traditional CBMs and state-of-the-art explainable methods, all without requiring any training and utilizing only a few annotated examples. The code is available at https://github.com/CristianoPatricio/2-step-concept-based-skin-diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted for review</p></details> |

Previous hallucination evaluation studies on LVLMs have identified hallucinations in terms of objects, attributes, and relations but overlooked complex hallucinations that create an entire narrative around a fictional entity. In this paper, we introduce a refined taxonomy of hallucinations, featuring a new category: Event Hallucination. We then utilize advanced LLMs to generate and filter fine grained hallucinatory data consisting of various types of hallucinations, with a particular focus on event hallucinations, laying the groundwork for integrating discriminative and generative evaluation methods within our universal evaluation framework. The proposed benchmark distinctively assesses LVLMs ability to tackle a broad spectrum of hallucinations, making it a reliable and comprehensive tool for gauging LVLMs efficacy in handling hallucinations.

This makes it ideal for real-world robots and safety-critical scenarios, where collecting online data or expert demonstrations is slow, costly, and risky. However, most existing offline RL works assume the dataset is already labeled with the task rewards, a process that often requires significant human effort, especially when ground-truth states are hard to ascertain (e.g., in the real-world). In this paper, we build on prior work, specifically RL-VLM-F, and propose a novel system that automatically generates reward labels for offline datasets using preference feedback from a vision-language model and a text description of the task. Our method then learns a policy using offline RL with the reward-labeled dataset. We demonstrate the system's applicability to a complex real-world robot-assisted dressing task, where we first learn a reward function using a vision-language model on a sub-optimal offline dataset, and then we use the learned reward to employ Implicit Q learning to develop an effective dressing policy. Our method also performs well in simulation tasks involving the manipulation of rigid and deformable objects, and significantly outperform baselines such as behavior cloning and inverse RL. In summary, we propose a new system that enables automatic reward labeling and policy learning from unlabeled, sub-optimal offline datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

| **[On Erroneous Agreements of CLIP Image Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05195v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research suggests that the failures of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) at visual reasoning often stem from erroneous agreements -- when semantically distinct images are ambiguously encoded by the CLIP image encoder into embeddings with high cosine similarity. In this paper, we show that erroneous agreements are not always the main culprit, as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can still extract distinct information from them. For instance, when distinguishing objects on the left vs right in the What'sUp benchmark, the CLIP image embeddings of the left/right pairs have an average cosine similarity $>0.99$, and CLIP performs at random chance; but LLaVA-1.5-7B, which uses the same CLIP image encoder, achieves nearly $100\%$ accuracy. We find that the extractable information in CLIP image embeddings is likely obscured by CLIP's inadequate vision-language alignment: Its matching score learned by the contrastive objective might not capture all diverse image-text correspondences. We also study the MMVP benchmark, on which prior work has shown that LLaVA-1.5 cannot distinguish image pairs with high cosine similarity. We observe a performance gain brought by attending more to visual input through an alternative decoding algorithm. Further, the accuracy significantly increases if the model can take both images as input to emphasize their nuanced differences. Both findings indicate that LLaVA-1.5 did not utilize extracted visual information sufficiently. In conclusion, our findings suggest that while improving image encoders could benefit VLMs, there is still room to enhance models with a fixed image encoder by applying better strategies for extracting and utilizing visual information.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

Leveraging these insights, we utilize Large Vision Language Models to generate synthetic captions for training. Models trained with these synthetic captions show similar behavior to those trained on human-annotated captions, underscores the potential for synthetic data in text-to-image training.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Findings.

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models. Powered by DynaMem, our robots can explore novel environments, search for objects not found in memory, and continuously update the memory as objects move, appear, or disappear in the scene. We run extensive experiments on the Stretch SE3 robots in three real and nine offline scenes, and achieve an average pick-and-drop success rate of 70% on non-stationary objects, which is more than a 2x improvement over state-of-the-art static systems.

Existing automatic editing systems are mainly scene- or event-specific, e.g., soccer game broadcasting, yet the automatic systems for general editing, e.g., movie or vlog editing which covers various scenes and events, were rarely studied before, and converting the event-driven editing method to a general scene is nontrivial. In this paper, we propose a two-stage scheme for general editing. Firstly, unlike previous works that extract scene-specific features, we leverage the pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract the editing-relevant representations as editing context. Moreover, to close the gap between the professional-looking videos and the automatic productions generated with simple guidelines, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based editing framework to formulate the editing problem and train the virtual editor to make better sequential editing decisions. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on a more general editing task with a real movie dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed context representation and the learning ability of our RL-based editing framework.</p></details> |  |

In our work, we introduce \textsc{StyLIP}, a novel domain-agnostic prompt learning strategy for Domain Generalization (DG). StyLIP disentangles visual style and content in CLIP`s vision encoder by using style projectors to learn domain-specific prompt tokens and combining them with content features. Trained contrastively, this approach enables seamless adaptation across domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple DG benchmarks. Additionally, we propose AD-CLIP for unsupervised domain adaptation (DA), leveraging CLIP`s frozen vision backbone to learn domain-invariant prompts through image style and content features. By aligning domains in embedding space with entropy minimization, AD-CLIP effectively handles domain shifts, even when only target domain samples are available. Lastly, we outline future work on class discovery using prompt learning for semantic segmentation in remote sensing, focusing on identifying novel or rare classes in unstructured environments. This paves the way for more adaptive and generalizable models in complex, real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICVGI...</summary><p>ICVGIP 2024, Young Faculty Symposium</p></details> |
| **[TAP-VL: Text Layout-Aware Pre-training for Enriched Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04642v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language (VL) models have garnered considerable research interest; however, they still face challenges in effectively handling text within images. To address this limitation, researchers have developed two approaches. The first method involves utilizing external Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools to extract textual information from images, which is then prepended to other textual inputs. The second strategy focuses on employing extremely high-resolution images to improve text recognition capabilities. In this paper, we focus on enhancing the first strategy by introducing a novel method, named TAP-VL, which treats OCR information as a distinct modality and seamlessly integrates it into any VL model. TAP-VL employs a lightweight transformer-based OCR module to receive OCR with layout information, compressing it into a short fixed-length sequence for input into the LLM. Initially, we conduct model-agnostic pretraining of the OCR module on unlabeled documents, followed by its integration into any VL architecture through brief fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements when applying TAP-VL to top-performing VL models, across scene-text and document-based VL benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Language Models are In-Context Value Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04549v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting temporal progress from visual trajectories is important for intelligent robots that can learn, adapt, and improve. However, learning such progress estimator, or temporal value function, across different tasks and domains requires both a large amount of diverse data and methods which can scale and generalize. To address these challenges, we present Generative Value Learning (\GVL), a universal value function estimator that leverages the world knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress. Naively asking a VLM to predict values for a video sequence performs poorly due to the strong temporal correlation between successive frames. Instead, GVL poses value estimation as a temporal ordering problem over shuffled video frames; this seemingly more challenging task encourages VLMs to more fully exploit their underlying semantic and temporal grounding capabilities to differentiate frames based on their perceived task progress, consequently producing significantly better value predictions. Without any robot or task specific training, GVL can in-context zero-shot and few-shot predict effective values for more than 300 distinct real-world tasks across diverse robot platforms, including challenging bimanual manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GVL permits flexible multi-modal in-context learning via examples from heterogeneous tasks and embodiments, such as human videos. The generality of GVL enables various downstream applications pertinent to visuomotor policy learning, including dataset filtering, success detection, and advantage-weighted regression -- all without any model training or finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website and demo: https://generative-value-learning.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Calibrated Robust Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01723v7)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization during in-distribution (ID) adaptation is a primary goal of robust fine-tuning of zero-shot models beyond naive fine-tuning. However, despite decent OOD generalization performance from recent robust fine-tuning methods, confidence calibration for reliable model output has not been fully addressed. This work proposes a robust fine-tuning method that improves both OOD accuracy and confidence calibration simultaneously in vision language models. Firstly, we show that both OOD classification and OOD calibration errors have a shared upper bound consisting of two terms of ID data: 1) ID calibration error and 2) the smallest singular value of the ID input covariance matrix. Based on this insight, we design a novel framework that conducts fine-tuning with a constrained multimodal contrastive loss enforcing a larger smallest singular value, which is further guided by the self-distillation of a moving-averaged model to achieve calibrated prediction as well. Starting from empirical evidence supporting our theoretical statements, we provide extensive experimental results on ImageNet distribution shift benchmarks that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theorem and its practical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 (a short version was presented at the NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Distribution Shifts); Major modification of (v7): Fixing the x-axis of Figure 3 and Pearson correlation, accordingly</p></details> |

VLMs are being quickly adopted for a variety of tasks ranging from few-shot classification to text-guided image generation, making debiasing VLM embeddings crucial. Debiasing approaches that fine-tune the VLM often suffer from catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, fine-tuning-free methods typically utilize a "one-size-fits-all" approach that assumes that correlation with the spurious attribute can be explained using a single linear direction across all possible inputs. In this work, we propose Bend-VLM, a nonlinear, fine-tuning-free approach for VLM embedding debiasing that tailors the debiasing operation to each unique input. This allows for a more flexible debiasing approach. Additionally, we do not require knowledge of the set of inputs a priori to inference time, making our method more appropriate for online, open-set tasks such as retrieval and text guided image generation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we reveal an unfair distribution of safety across the layers of VLM's vision encoder, with earlier and middle layers being disproportionately vulnerable to malicious inputs compared to the more robust final layers. This 'cross-layer' vulnerability stems from the model's inability to generalize its safety training from the default architectural settings used during training to unseen or out-of-distribution scenarios, leaving certain layers exposed. We conduct a comprehensive analysis by projecting activations from various intermediate layers and demonstrate that these layers are more likely to generate harmful outputs when exposed to malicious inputs. Our experiments with LLaVA-1.5 and Llama 3.2 show discrepancies in attack success rates and toxicity scores across layers, indicating that current safety alignment strategies focused on a single default layer are insufficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under Review</p></details> |

The rapid growth of video content on social platforms and streaming services, along with privacy concerns, has increased the need for contextual advertising. Placing the right ad in the right context creates a seamless and pleasant ad viewing experience, resulting in higher audience engagement and, ultimately, better ad monetization. From a technology standpoint, effective contextual advertising requires a video retrieval system capable of understanding complex video content at a very granular level. Current text-to-video retrieval models based on joint multimodal training demand large datasets and computational resources, limiting their practicality and lacking the key functionalities required for ad ecosystem integration. We introduce ContextIQ, a multimodal expert-based video retrieval system designed specifically for contextual advertising. ContextIQ utilizes modality-specific experts-video, audio, transcript (captions), and metadata such as objects, actions, emotion, etc.-to create semantically rich video representations. We show that our system, without joint training, achieves better or comparable results to state-of-the-art models and commercial solutions on multiple text-to-video retrieval benchmarks. Our ablation studies highlight the benefits of leveraging multiple modalities for enhanced video retrieval accuracy instead of using a vision-language model alone. Furthermore, we show how video retrieval systems such as ContextIQ can be used for contextual advertising in an ad ecosystem while also addressing concerns related to brand safety and filtering inappropriate content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Medical Adaptation of Large Language and Vision-Language Models: Are We Making Progress?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04118v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several recent works seek to develop foundation models specifically for medical applications, adapting general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) via continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare seven public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting regime for medical question-answering (QA) tasks. For instance, across the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 38.2% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Main Conference as Long Paper (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[RaVL: Discovering and Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Fine-Tuned Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04097v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) often capture spurious correlations between image features and textual attributes, resulting in degraded zero-shot performance at test time. Existing approaches for addressing spurious correlations (i) primarily operate at the global image-level rather than intervening directly on fine-grained image features and (ii) are predominantly designed for unimodal settings. In this work, we present RaVL, which takes a fine-grained perspective on VLM robustness by discovering and mitigating spurious correlations using local image features rather than operating at the global image level. Given a fine-tuned VLM, RaVL first discovers spurious correlations by leveraging a region-level clustering approach to identify precise image features contributing to zero-shot classification errors. Then, RaVL mitigates the identified spurious correlation with a novel region-aware loss function that enables the VLM to focus on relevant regions and ignore spurious relationships during fine-tuning. We evaluate RaVL on 654 VLMs with various model architectures, data domains, and learned spurious correlations. Our results show that RaVL accurately discovers (191% improvement over the closest baseline) and mitigates (8.2% improvement on worst-group image classification accuracy) spurious correlations. Qualitative evaluations on general-domain and medical-domain VLMs confirm our findings.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Nevertheless, these models often suffer from hallucinations, e.g., they exhibit inconsistencies between the visual input and the textual output. To address this, we propose H-POPE, a coarse-to-fine-grained benchmark that systematically assesses hallucination in object existence and attributes. Our evaluation shows that models are prone to hallucinations on object existence, and even more so on fine-grained attributes. We further investigate whether these models rely on visual input to formulate the output texts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Poste...</summary><p>Poster at https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/bb-stat/home</p></details> |
| **[Select2Plan: Training-Free ICL-Based Planning through VQA and Memory Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04006v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the potential of off-the-shelf Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for high-level robot planning in the context of autonomous navigation. Indeed, while most of existing learning-based approaches for path planning require extensive task-specific training/fine-tuning, we demonstrate how such training can be avoided for most practical cases. To do this, we introduce Select2Plan (S2P), a novel training-free framework for high-level robot planning which completely eliminates the need for fine-tuning or specialised training. By leveraging structured Visual Question-Answering (VQA) and In-Context Learning (ICL), our approach drastically reduces the need for data collection, requiring a fraction of the task-specific data typically used by trained models, or even relying only on online data. Our method facilitates the effective use of a generally trained VLM in a flexible and cost-efficient way, and does not require additional sensing except for a simple monocular camera. We demonstrate its adaptability across various scene types, context sources, and sensing setups. We evaluate our approach in two distinct scenarios: traditional First-Person View (FPV) and infrastructure-driven Third-Person View (TPV) navigation, demonstrating the flexibility and simplicity of our method. Our technique significantly enhances the navigational capabilities of a baseline VLM of approximately 50% in TPV scenario, and is comparable to trained models in the FPV one, with as few as 20 demonstrations.</p></details> |  |

How well do current vision-language models (VLMs) navigate these nuances? To investigate this, we create the first multimodal and multilingual parallel hate speech dataset, annotated by a multicultural set of annotators, called Multi3Hate. It contains 300 parallel meme samples across 5 languages: English, German, Spanish, Hindi, and Mandarin. We demonstrate that cultural background significantly affects multimodal hate speech annotation in our dataset. The average pairwise agreement among countries is just 74%, significantly lower than that of randomly selected annotator groups. Our qualitative analysis indicates that the lowest pairwise label agreement-only 67% between the USA and India-can be attributed to cultural factors. We then conduct experiments with 5 large VLMs in a zero-shot setting, finding that these models align more closely with annotations from the US than with those from other cultures, even when the memes and prompts are presented in the dominant language of the other culture. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/MinhDucBui/Multi3Hate.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Learning Multiple Object States from Actions via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01090v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing the states of objects in a video is crucial in understanding the scene beyond actions and objects. For instance, an egg can be raw, cracked, and whisked while cooking an omelet, and these states can coexist simultaneously (an egg can be both raw and whisked). However, most existing research assumes a single object state change (e.g., uncracked -> cracked), overlooking the coexisting nature of multiple object states and the influence of past states on the current state. We formulate object state recognition as a multi-label classification task that explicitly handles multiple states. We then propose to learn multiple object states from narrated videos by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-labels from the transcribed narrations, capturing the influence of past states. The challenge is that narrations mostly describe human actions in the video but rarely explain object states. Therefore, we use the LLMs knowledge of the relationship between actions and states to derive the missing object states. We further accumulate the derived object states to consider past state contexts to infer current object state pseudo-labels. We newly collect a dataset called the Multiple Object States Transition (MOST) dataset, which includes manual multi-label annotation for evaluation purposes, covering 60 object states across six object categories. Experimental results show that our model trained on LLM-generated pseudo-labels significantly outperforms strong vision-language models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pseudo-labeling framework that considers past context via LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an accepted WACV 2025 paper.

The emergence of generative AI offers considerable potential to enhance this process by streamlining video analysis and facilitating idea generation. In this paper, we present DesignMinds, a prototype that integrates a state-of-the-art Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a context-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) to support ideation in VBD. To evaluate DesignMinds, we conducted a between-subject study with 35 design practitioners, comparing its performance to a baseline condition. Our results demonstrate that DesignMinds significantly enhances the flexibility and originality of ideation, while also increasing task engagement. Importantly, the introduction of this technology did not negatively impact user experience, technology acceptance, or usability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Model for Automated Engineering Drawing Information Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03707v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) plays a critical role in manufacturing by defining acceptable variations in part features to ensure component quality and functionality. However, extracting GD&T information from 2D engineering drawings is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, often relying on manual efforts or semi-automated tools. To address these challenges, this study proposes an automated and computationally efficient GD&T extraction method by fine-tuning Florence-2, an open-source vision-language model (VLM). The model is trained on a dataset of 400 drawings with ground truth annotations provided by domain experts. For comparison, two state-of-the-art closed-source VLMs, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, are evaluated on the same dataset. All models are assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and hallucination metrics. Due to the computational cost and impracticality of fine-tuning large closed-source VLMs for domain-specific tasks, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet are evaluated in a zero-shot setting. In contrast, Florence-2, a smaller model with 0.23 billion parameters, is optimized through full-parameter fine-tuning across three distinct experiments, each utilizing datasets augmented to different levels. The results show that Florence-2 achieves a 29.95% increase in precision, a 37.75% increase in recall, a 52.40% improvement in F1-score, and a 43.15% reduction in hallucination rate compared to the best-performing closed-source model. These findings highlight the effectiveness of fine-tuning smaller, open-source VLMs like Florence-2, offering a practical and efficient solution for automated GD&T extraction to support downstream manufacturing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper has been submitted to the 9th International Conference on Innovation in Artificial Intelligence (ICIAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[VHM: Versatile and Honest Vision Language Model for Remote Sensing Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20213v3)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a Versatile and Honest vision language Model (VHM) for remote sensing image analysis. VHM is built on a large-scale remote sensing image-text dataset with rich-content captions (VersaD), and an honest instruction dataset comprising both factual and deceptive questions (HnstD). Unlike prevailing remote sensing image-text datasets, in which image captions focus on a few prominent objects and their relationships, VersaD captions provide detailed information about image properties, object attributes, and the overall scene. This comprehensive captioning enables VHM to thoroughly understand remote sensing images and perform diverse remote sensing tasks. Moreover, different from existing remote sensing instruction datasets that only include factual questions, HnstD contains additional deceptive questions stemming from the non-existence of objects. This feature prevents VHM from producing affirmative answers to nonsense queries, thereby ensuring its honesty. In our experiments, VHM significantly outperforms various vision language models on common tasks of scene classification, visual question answering, and visual grounding. Additionally, VHM achieves competent performance on several unexplored tasks, such as building vectorizing, multi-label classification and honest question answering. We will release the code, data and model weights at https://github.com/opendatalab/VHM .</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution: Chao Pang, Xingxing Weng, Jiang Wu; Corresponding author: Gui-Song Xia, Conghui He</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Reward as Condition for Instruction-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04713v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality training triplets (instruction, original image, edited image) are essential for instruction-based image editing. Predominant training datasets (e.g., InsPix2Pix) are created using text-to-image generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) which are not trained for image editing. Accordingly, these datasets suffer from inaccurate instruction following, poor detail preserving, and generation artifacts. In this paper, we propose to address the training data quality issue with multi-perspective reward data instead of refining the ground-truth image quality. 1) we first design a quantitative metric system based on best-in-class LVLM (Large Vision Language Model), i.e., GPT-4o in our case, to evaluate the generation quality from 3 perspectives, namely, instruction following, detail preserving, and generation quality. For each perspective, we collected quantitative score in $0\sim 5$ and text descriptive feedback on the specific failure points in ground-truth edited images, resulting in a high-quality editing reward dataset, i.e., RewardEdit20K. 2) We further proposed a novel training framework to seamlessly integrate the metric output, regarded as multi-reward, into editing models to learn from the imperfect training triplets. During training, the reward scores and text descriptions are encoded as embeddings and fed into both the latent space and the U-Net of the editing models as auxiliary conditions. During inference, we set these additional conditions to the highest score with no text description for failure points, to aim at the best generation outcome. Experiments indicate that our multi-reward conditioned model outperforms its no-reward counterpart on two popular editing pipelines, i.e., InsPix2Pix and SmartEdit. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> |  |

Document parsing extract reliable structured data from unstructured inputs, providing huge convenience for numerous applications. Especially with recent achievements in Large Language Models, document parsing plays an indispensable role in both knowledge base construction and training data generation. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the current state of document parsing, covering key methodologies, from modular pipeline systems to end-to-end models driven by large vision-language models. Core components such as layout detection, content extraction (including text, tables, and mathematical expressions), and multi-modal data integration are examined in detail. Additionally, this paper discusses the challenges faced by modular document parsing systems and vision-language models in handling complex layouts, integrating multiple modules, and recognizing high-density text. It emphasizes the importance of developing larger and more diverse datasets and outlines future research directions.</p></details> |  |

However, with the increasing integration of visual data, privacy concerns in Vision Language Models (VLMs) remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce Facial Identity Unlearning Benchmark (FIUBench), a novel VLM unlearning benchmark designed to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning algorithms under the Right to be Forgotten setting. Specifically, we formulate the VLM unlearning task via constructing the Fictitious Facial Identity VQA dataset and apply a two-stage evaluation pipeline that is designed to precisely control the sources of information and their exposure levels. In terms of evaluation, since VLM supports various forms of ways to ask questions with the same semantic meaning, we also provide robust evaluation metrics including membership inference attacks and carefully designed adversarial privacy attacks to evaluate the performance of algorithms. Through the evaluation of four baseline VLM unlearning algorithms within FIUBench, we find that all methods remain limited in their unlearning performance, with significant trade-offs between model utility and forget quality. Furthermore, our findings also highlight the importance of privacy attacks for robust evaluations. We hope FIUBench will drive progress in developing more effective VLM unlearning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

| **[Advances in Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction and Quantitative Analysis for Biomedical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02843v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) represents an innovative biomedical imaging modality that harnesses the advantages of optical resolution and acoustic penetration depth while ensuring enhanced safety. Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging Systems: The Bayesian Cramér-Rao Bound Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09557v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution imaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and blood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v3)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GPU-Based Parallel Computing Methods for Medical Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10928v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement in GPU technology, establishing it as a formidable high-performance parallel computing technology with superior floating-point computational capabilities compared to traditional CPUs. This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-informed and wavelength-flexible data-driven photoacoustic oximetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14863v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significance: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) promises to measure spatially-resolved blood oxygen saturation, but suffers from a lack of accurate and robust spectral unmixing methods to deliver on this promise. Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

| **[BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11273v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image priors with 3D representation methods, e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to feed-forward generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. An obstacle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end feed-forward approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the spatial feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts. The code is available in the project page.</p></details> |  |

Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations. We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench. Our study offers valuable insights into the application of EAs in LLM-based RSs. Additionally, we explore key components that may influence the overall performance of the RS, providing meaningful guidance for future research on the development of LLM-based EAs in RSs.</p></details> |  |

Therefore the energy consumption of code must be minimized. Code can be generated by large language models. We look at the influence of prompt modification on the energy consumption of the code generated. We use three different Python code problems of varying difficulty levels. Prompt modification is done by adding the sentence ``Give me an energy-optimized solution for this problem'' or by using two Python coding best practices. The large language models used are CodeLlama-70b, CodeLlama-70b-Instruct, CodeLlama-70b-Python, DeepSeek-Coder-33b-base, and DeepSeek-Coder-33b-instruct. We find a decrease in energy consumption for a specific combination of prompt optimization, LLM, and Python code problem. However, no single optimization prompt consistently decreases energy consumption for the same LLM across the different Python code problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Prompt Formatting Have Any Impact on LLM Performance?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10541v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt optimization is crucial for model performance. Although previous research has explored aspects like rephrasing prompt contexts, using various prompting techniques (like in-context learning and chain-of-thought), and ordering few-shot examples, our understanding of LLM sensitivity to prompt templates remains limited. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of different prompt templates on LLM performance. We formatted the same contexts into various human-readable templates, including plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML, and evaluated their impact across tasks like natural language reasoning, code generation, and translation using OpenAI's GPT models. Experiments show that GPT-3.5-turbo's performance varies by up to 40\% in a code translation task depending on the prompt template, while larger models like GPT-4 are more robust to these variations. Our analysis highlights the need to reconsider the use of fixed prompt templates, as different formats can significantly affect model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Rewarding with Prompt Optimization Enables Tuning-free Self-Alignment of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08733v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) traditionally relies on costly training and human preference annotations. Self-alignment seeks to reduce these expenses by enabling models to align themselves. To further lower costs and achieve alignment without any expensive tuning or annotations, we introduce a new tuning-free approach for self-alignment, Dynamic Rewarding with Prompt Optimization (DRPO). Our approach leverages a search-based optimization framework that allows LLMs to iteratively self-improve and craft the optimal alignment instructions, all without additional training or human intervention. The core of DRPO is a dynamic rewarding mechanism, which identifies and rectifies model-specific alignment weaknesses, allowing LLMs to adapt efficiently to diverse alignment challenges. Empirical evaluations on eight recent LLMs, both open- and closed-sourced, demonstrate that DRPO significantly enhances alignment performance, with base models outperforming their SFT/RLHF-tuned counterparts. Moreover, the prompts automatically optimized by DRPO surpass those curated by human experts, further validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings highlight the great potential of current LLMs to achieve adaptive self-alignment through inference-time optimization, complementing tuning-based alignment methods.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Main |

By refining and extending user-provided prompts, TIPO bridges the gap between simple inputs and the detailed prompts required for high-quality image generation. Unlike previous approaches that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO adjusts user input prompts with the distribution of a trained prompt dataset, eliminating the need for complex runtime cost via lightweight model. This pre-sampling approach enables efficient and scalable prompt optimization, grounded in the model's training distribution. Experimental results demonstrate TIPO's effectiveness in improving aesthetic scores, reducing image corruption, and better aligning generated images with dataset distributions. These findings highlight the critical role of prompt engineering in T2I systems and open avenues for broader applications of automatic prompt refinement.</p></details> | 21 pages, 13 figures |

However, the lack of in-depth analysis limits the use of this phenomenon for prompt engineering in practice. In this study, we posit that likelihoods serve as an effective gauge for language model performance. Through experiments on two question-answering datasets with a variety of state-of-the-art language models, we reveal correlations between answer accuracy and the likelihood of the question at both the corpus level and the instance level. In addition, we find that question likelihood can also indicate the position of the task-relevant information in the context. Based on these findings, we propose two methods that use question likelihood as a gauge for selecting and constructing prompts that lead to better performance. We demonstrate their effectiveness with experiments. In addition, our likelihood-based methods are efficient, as they only need to compute the likelihood of the input, requiring much fewer language model passes than heuristic prompt engineering methods that require generating responses. Our analysis deepens our understanding of how input prompts affect model performance and provides a promising direction for efficient prompt optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at NAACL 2025.

Recent works utilize feedbacks generated from erroneous cases to guide the prompt optimization. During inference, they may further retrieve several semantically-related exemplars and concatenate them to the optimized prompts to improve the performance. However, those works only utilize the feedback at the current step, ignoring historical and unseleccted feedbacks which are potentially beneficial. Moreover, the selection of exemplars only considers the general semantic relationship and may not be optimal in terms of task performance and matching with the optimized prompt. In this work, we propose an Exemplar-Guided Reflection with Memory mechanism (ERM) to realize more efficient and accurate prompt optimization. Specifically, we design an exemplar-guided reflection mechanism where the feedback generation is additionally guided by the generated exemplars. We further build two kinds of memory to fully utilize the historical feedback information and support more effective exemplar retrieval. Empirical evaluations show our method surpasses previous state-of-the-arts with less optimization steps, i.e., improving F1 score by 10.1 on LIAR dataset, and reducing half of the optimization steps on ProTeGi.</p></details> |  |
| **[SequentialBreak: Large Language Models Can be Fooled by Embedding Jailbreak Prompts into Sequential Prompt Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06426v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the integration of the Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications increases, so does their susceptibility to misuse, raising significant security concerns. Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to assess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks mainly rely on scenario camouflage, prompt obfuscation, prompt optimization, and prompt iterative optimization to conceal malicious prompts. In particular, sequential prompt chains in a single query can lead LLMs to focus on certain prompts while ignoring others, facilitating context manipulation. This paper introduces SequentialBreak, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits this vulnerability. We discuss several scenarios, not limited to examples like Question Bank, Dialog Completion, and Game Environment, where the harmful prompt is embedded within benign ones that can fool LLMs into generating harmful responses. The distinct narrative structures of these scenarios show that SequentialBreak is flexible enough to adapt to various prompt formats beyond those discussed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SequentialBreak uses only a single query to achieve a substantial gain of attack success rate over existing baselines against both open-source and closed-source models. Through our research, we highlight the urgent need for more robust and resilient safeguards to enhance LLM security and prevent potential misuse.

While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |

On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar optimization, EO). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO receiving more research attention recently. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and EO techniques both isolation and combination on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars, consistently improves performance on top of IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with EO strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe a synergy between EO and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing the individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar optimization both as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remain a crucial aspect of APO and deserve greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Expan...</summary><p>Expanded version of the NeurIPS 2024 paper</p></details> |

Recently, Vision-Language~(VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers. Experimental results show that our proposed ChatTracker achieves a performance comparable to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedDTPT: Federated Discrete and Transferable Prompt Tuning for Black-Box Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00985v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP). By fine-tuning LLMs with data from specific scenarios, these foundation models can better adapt to various downstream tasks. However, the fine-tuning process poses privacy leakage risks, particularly in centralized data processing scenarios. To address user privacy concerns, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to mitigate the risks associated with centralized data collection from multiple sources. Nevertheless, the privacy of LLMs themselves is equally critical, as potential malicious attacks challenge their security, an issue that has received limited attention in current research. Consequently, establishing a trusted multi-party model fine-tuning environment is essential. Additionally, the local deployment of large LLMs incurs significant storage costs and high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose for the first time a federated discrete and transferable prompt tuning, namely FedDTPT, for black-box large language models. In the client optimization phase, we adopt a token-level discrete prompt optimization method that leverages a feedback loop based on prediction accuracy to drive gradient-free prompt optimization through the MLM API. For server optimization, we employ an attention mechanism based on semantic similarity to filter all local prompt tokens, along with an embedding distance elbow detection and DBSCAN clustering strategy to enhance the filtering process. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves higher accuracy, reduced communication overhead, and robustness to non-iid data in a black-box setting. Moreover, the optimized prompts are transferable.</p></details> |  |

Building on ProTeGi, MAPO uses positive natural language "gradients" and a momentum-based extension to refine prompts effectively. By tracking gradient history, MAPO avoids local minima and oscillations. It also utilizes beam search and an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for balanced candidate expansion and selection. Benchmark testing shows that MAPO achieves faster convergence time with fewer API calls and higher F1 scores than ProTeGi, proving it as a robust and scalable solution for automated prompt engineering in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

AutoDiff frameworks, like PyTorch, enable efficient end-to-end optimization of differentiable systems. However, general computational workflows can be non-differentiable and involve rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). We investigate end-to-end generative optimization -- using generative models such as LLMs within the optimizer for automatic updating of general computational workflows. We discover that workflow execution traces are akin to back-propagated gradients in AutoDiff and can provide key information to interpret feedback for efficient optimization. Formally, we frame a new mathematical setup, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO). In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. We provide a Python library, Trace, that efficiently converts a workflow optimization problem into an OPTO instance using PyTorch-like syntax. Using Trace, we develop a general LLM-based generative optimizer called OptoPrime. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We envision Trace as an open research platform for devising novel generative optimizers and developing the next generation of interactive learning agents.

| **[Fight Back Against Jailbreaking via Prompt Adversarial Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06255v4)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to jailbreaking attacks. Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly focusing on model fine-tuning or heuristical defense designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through prompt optimization remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both grey-box and black-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0%, while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task and incurring only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security.

Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest.

While current methods adopt the paradigm of training a dedicated network end-to-end using labeled image data, they are limited in terms of generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we first present a simple yet well-crafted framework named {\name}, which combines the perception capability of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a modular framework, providing a strong baseline for social relation recognition. Specifically, we instruct VFMs to translate image content into a textual social story, and then utilize LLMs for text-based reasoning. {\name} introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers, as LLMs can generate language-based explanations for the decisions. The manual prompt design process for LLMs at the reasoning phase is tedious and an automated prompt optimization method is desired. As we essentially convert a visual classification task into a generative task of LLMs, automatic prompt optimization encounters a unique long prompt optimization issue. To address this issue, we further propose the Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a greedy search by utilizing gradient information at the segment level. Experimental results show that GSPO significantly improves performance, and our method also generalizes to different image styles.

However, its performance often degrades clearly along the tuning process when the prompts are continuously updated with the test data flow, and the degradation becomes more severe when the domain of test samples changes continuously. We propose HisTPT, a Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning technique that memorizes the useful knowledge of the learnt test samples and enables robust test-time prompt tuning with the memorized knowledge. HisTPT introduces three types of knowledge banks, namely, local knowledge bank, hard-sample knowledge bank, and global knowledge bank, each of which works with different mechanisms for effective knowledge memorization and test-time prompt optimization. In addition, HisTPT features an adaptive knowledge retrieval mechanism that regularizes the prediction of each test sample by adaptively retrieving the memorized knowledge. Extensive experiments show that HisTPT achieves superior prompt tuning performance consistently while handling different visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection) and test samples from continuously changing domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Camera Ready</p></details> |

Past research has focused on optimizing prompts specific to a task. However, much less attention has been given to optimizing the general instructions included in a prompt, known as a system prompt. To address this gap, we propose SPRIG, an edit-based genetic algorithm that iteratively constructs prompts from prespecified components to maximize the model's performance in general scenarios. We evaluate the performance of system prompts on a collection of 47 different types of tasks to ensure generalizability. Our study finds that a single optimized system prompt performs on par with task prompts optimized for each individual task. Moreover, combining system and task-level optimizations leads to further improvement, which showcases their complementary nature. Experiments also reveal that the optimized system prompts generalize effectively across model families, parameter sizes, and languages. This study provides insights into the role of system-level instructions in maximizing LLM potential.</p></details> |  |

However, the recent advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters makes the naive application of traditional FL methods to LLMs impractical due to high computational and communication costs. Furthermore, end users of LLMs often lack access to full architectures and weights of the models, making it impossible for participants to fine-tune these models directly. This paper introduces a novel FL scheme for LLMs, named LanFL, which is purely prompt-based and treats the underlying LLMs as black boxes. We have developed a differentially private synthetic sample generation mechanism to facilitate knowledge sharing among participants, along with a prompt optimization scheme that enables learning from synthetic samples. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LanFL successfully facilitates learning among participants while preserving the privacy of local datasets across various tasks.</p></details> |  |

We utilize recent public collections of user-LLM interactions to construct a natural benchmark called PUPA, which contains personally identifiable information (PII). To study potential approaches, we devise PAPILLON, a multi-stage LLM pipeline that uses prompt optimization to address a simpler version of our task. Our best pipeline maintains high response quality for 85.5% of user queries while restricting privacy leakage to only 7.5%.

These agent-based systems represent an emerging shift in personal computing. We contribute to the security foundations of agent-based systems and surface a new class of automatically computed obfuscated adversarial prompt attacks that violate the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to an LLM agent. We show how prompt optimization techniques can find such prompts automatically given the weights of a model. We demonstrate that such attacks transfer to production-level agents. For example, we show an information exfiltration attack on Mistral's LeChat agent that analyzes a user's conversation, picks out personally identifiable information, and formats it into a valid markdown command that results in leaking that data to the attacker's server. This attack shows a nearly 80% success rate in an end-to-end evaluation. We conduct a range of experiments to characterize the efficacy of these attacks and find that they reliably work on emerging agent-based systems like Mistral's LeChat, ChatGLM, and Meta's Llama.

Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for thae creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Main Track</p></details> |

However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize the volume of the Pareto reward surface perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce "Survival of the Safest" (SoS), an innovative multi-objective prompt optimization framework that enhances both performance and security in LLMs simultaneously. SoS utilizes an interleaved multi-objective evolution strategy, integrating semantic, feedback, and crossover mutations to effectively traverse the prompt landscape. Differing from the computationally demanding Pareto front methods, SoS provides a scalable solution that expedites optimization in complex, high-dimensional discrete search spaces while keeping computational demands low. Our approach accommodates flexible weighting of objectives and generates a pool of optimized candidates, empowering users to select prompts that optimally meet their specific performance and security needs. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets affirm SoS's efficacy in delivering high performance and notably enhancing safety and security compared to single-objective methods. This advancement marks a significant stride towards the deployment of LLM systems that are both high-performing and secure across varied industrial applications</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |

Unlike black-box predictive models, ABMs excel at explaining the micro-macro linkages that drive such emergent behaviors. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of LLM agents capable of simulating urban activities with unprecedented realism. However, the extreme high computational cost of LLMs presents significant challenges for scaling up the simulations of LLM agents. To address this problem, we propose OpenCity, a scalable simulation platform optimized for both system and prompt efficiencies. Specifically, we propose a LLM request scheduler to reduce communication overhead by parallelizing requests through IO multiplexing. Besides, we deisgn a "group-and-distill" prompt optimization strategy minimizes redundancy by clustering agents with similar static attributes. Through experiments on six global cities, OpenCity achieves a 600-fold acceleration in simulation time per agent, a 70% reduction in LLM requests, and a 50% reduction in token usage. These improvements enable the simulation of 10,000 agents' daily activities in 1 hour on commodity hardware. Besides, the substantial speedup of OpenCity allows us to establish a urban simulation benchmark for LLM agents for the first time, comparing simulated urban activities with real-world data in 6 major cities around the globe. We believe our OpenCity platform provides a critical infrastructure to harness the power of LLMs for interdisciplinary studies in urban space, fostering the collective efforts of broader research communities.

When dealing with complex issues, prompt engineers tend to distill multiple patterns from examples and inject relevant solutions to optimize the prompts, achieving satisfying results. However, existing automatic prompt optimization techniques are only limited to producing single flow instructions, struggling with handling diverse patterns. In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning. In experiments across five tasks, AMPO consistently achieves the best results.

While existing prompt optimization methods improve prompt effectiveness, they often lead to prompt drifting, where newly generated prompts can adversely impact previously successful cases while addressing failures. Furthermore, these methods tend to rely heavily on LLMs' intrinsic capabilities for prompt optimization tasks. In this paper, we introduce StraGo (Strategic-Guided Optimization), a novel approach designed to mitigate prompt drifting by leveraging insights from both successful and failed cases to identify critical factors for achieving optimization objectives. StraGo employs a how-to-do methodology, integrating in-context learning to formulate specific, actionable strategies that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for prompt optimization.

Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

While contemporary frontier LLMs are capable enough to power reasonably good Language agents, the closed-API model makes it hard to improve in cases they perform sub-optimally. To address this, recent works have explored ways to improve their performance using techniques like self-reflection and prompt optimization. Unfortunately, techniques like self-reflection can be used only in an online setup, while contemporary prompt optimization techniques are designed and tested to work on simple tasks. To this end, we introduce MetaReflection, a novel offline reinforcement learning technique that enhances the performance of Language Agents by augmenting a semantic memory based on experiential learnings from past trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of MetaReflection by evaluating across multiple domains, including complex logical reasoning, biomedical semantic similarity, open world question answering, and vulnerability threat detection, in Infrastructure-as-Code, spanning different agent designs.

However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4\% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA.</p></details> |  |

Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

These compound systems often lack intermediate labels or gradient flow to optimize each module, making their end-to-end optimization challenging. Here we seek strategies to optimize both the module-level LM weights and the associated prompt templates of such systems to maximize a downstream task metric. We propose for the first time combining the weight and prompt optimization strategies to optimize a modular LM pipeline by alternating between the two to get the same LM to teach itself. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification using mistral-7b, llama-2-7b, and llama-3-8b, these BetterTogether strategies optimizing the weights and prompts of a pipeline together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 60% and 6%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks.

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel algorithm for optimizing LM programs. MIPRO outperforms baseline optimizers on five of seven diverse multi-stage LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 13% accuracy.

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST) that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

Through a feedback-driven critique and synthesis process, PromptWizard achieves an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, iteratively refining both prompt instructions and in-context examples to generate human-readable, task-specific prompts. This guided approach systematically improves prompt quality, resulting in superior performance across 45 tasks. PromptWizard excels even with limited training data, smaller LLMs, and various LLM architectures. Additionally, our cost analysis reveals a substantial reduction in API calls, token usage, and overall cost, demonstrating PromptWizard's efficiency, scalability, and advantages over existing prompt optimization strategies.</p></details> |  |

In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights.

We propose the Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP) framework to address these gaps, enhancing both prompt optimization and adaptation. LCP employs contrastive learning to generate effective prompts by analyzing patterns in good and bad prompt examples. Our evaluation on the Big-Bench Hard dataset shows that LCP has a win rate of over 76% over existing methods in prompt optimization and demonstrates strong adaptability across different model versions, families, and languages.

However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study is a step in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functional code generation, supporting their integration into real-world software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, CCS 2024</p></details> |

While emerging prompt optimizers can automatically refine many of these aspects, we argue that clearly conveying customized requirements (e.g., how to handle diverse inputs) remains a human-centric challenge. In this work, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a study with 30 novices, we show that requirement-focused training doubles novices' prompting performance, significantly outperforming conventional prompt engineering training and prompt optimization. We also demonstrate that high-quality LLM outputs are directly tied to the quality of input requirements.

Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Automating recovery remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods often rely on human intervention to manually address failures or require exhaustive enumeration of failure cases and the design of specific recovery policies for each scenario, both of which are labor-intensive. Foundational Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which demonstrate remarkable common-sense generalization and reasoning capabilities, have broader, potentially unbounded ODDs. However, limitations in spatial reasoning continue to be a common challenge for many VLMs when applied to robot control and motion-level error recovery. In this paper, we investigate how optimizing visual and text prompts can enhance the spatial reasoning of VLMs, enabling them to function effectively as black-box controllers for both motion-level position correction and task-level recovery from unknown failures. Specifically, the optimizations include identifying key visual elements in visual prompts, highlighting these elements in text prompts for querying, and decomposing the reasoning process for failure detection and control generation. In experiments, prompt optimizations significantly outperform pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models in correcting motion-level position errors and improve accuracy by 65.78% compared to VLMs with unoptimized prompts. Additionally, for task-level failures, optimized prompts enhanced the success rate by 5.8%, 5.8%, and 7.5% in VLMs' abilities to detect failures, analyze issues, and generate recovery plans, respectively, across a wide range of unknown errors in Lego assembly.</p></details> |  |

Fine-grained TSR in the wild is difficult due to the complex road conditions, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR when data is lacking. Our strategy achieves effective fine-grained TSR by stimulating the multiple-thinking capability of large multimodal models (LMM). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for the LMM. The context descriptions with center coordinate prompt optimization help the LMM to locate the target traffic sign in the original road images containing multiple traffic signs and filter irrelevant answers through the proposed prior traffic sign hypothesis. The characteristic description is based on few-shot in-context learning of template traffic signs, which decreases the cross-domain difference and enhances the fine-grained recognition capability of the LMM. The differential descriptions of similar traffic signs optimize the multimodal thinking capability of the LMM. The proposed method is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art TSR results on all five datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiverseDialogue: A Methodology for Designing Chatbots with Human-Like Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00262v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), which simulate human users, are frequently employed to evaluate chatbots in applications such as tutoring and customer service. Effective evaluation necessitates a high degree of human-like diversity within these simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that conversations generated by GPT-4o mini, when used as simulated human participants, systematically differ from those between actual humans across multiple linguistic features. These features include topic variation, lexical attributes, and both the average behavior and diversity (variance) of the language used. To address these discrepancies, we propose an approach that automatically generates prompts for user simulations by incorporating features derived from real human interactions, such as age, gender, emotional tone, and the topics discussed. We assess our approach using differential language analysis combined with deep linguistic inquiry. Our method of prompt optimization, tailored to target specific linguistic features, shows significant improvements. Specifically, it enhances the human-likeness of LLM chatbot conversations, increasing their linguistic diversity. On average, we observe a 54 percent reduction in the error of average features between human and LLM-generated conversations. This method of constructing chatbot sets with human-like diversity holds great potential for enhancing the evaluation process of user-facing bots.</p></details> |  |

While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |

Existing multimodal fake news detection (MFND) methods can be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are overly dependent on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in QA is often undermined by the vagueness of user questions. To address this issue, we introduce single-round instance-level prompt optimization, referred to as question rewriter. By enhancing the intelligibility of human questions for black-box LLMs, our question rewriter improves the quality of generated answers. The rewriter is optimized using direct preference optimization based on feedback collected from automatic criteria for evaluating generated answers; therefore, its training does not require costly human annotations. The experiments across multiple black-box LLMs and long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. This paper provides a practical framework for training question rewriters and sets a precedent for future explorations in prompt optimization within LFQA tasks.

However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs. In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization (QPO), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM. We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions. Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts. Experiments on various LLM scales and diverse NLP and math tasks demonstrate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of our method in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

| **[Large Language Models Prompting With Episodic Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07465v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization is essential for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in scenarios of few-shot learning where training examples are incorporated directly into the prompt. Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose FUSE (Flexible Unification of Semantic Embeddings), an inexpensive approach to approximating an adapter layer that maps from one model's textual embedding space to another, even across different tokenizers. We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space. We show the efficacy of our approach via multi-objective optimization over vision-language and causal language models for image captioning and sentiment-based image captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a Conference Paper at COLM 2024; 10 Pages; https://github.com/jnwilliams/FUSE_prompt_inversion.git</p></details> |

As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024)</p></details> |

However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |

Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively refine prompts for an LLM, leading to significant improvements over various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2023 (Findings)</p></details> |

The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08364v3)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization. We release all the codes in \url{https://github.com/research4pan/Plum}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Findings of ACL 2024</p></details> |
| **[LangGPT: Rethinking Structured Reusable Prompt Design Framework for LLMs from the Programming Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16929v2)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have demonstrated commendable performance across diverse domains. Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Prompt Program Search: A Structure-Aware Approach to Efficient Compile-Time Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02319v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many modern LLM applications, such as retrieval augmented generation, prompts have become programs themselves. In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |
| **[LoPT: Low-Rank Prompt Tuning for Parameter Efficient Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19486v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In prompt tuning, a prefix or suffix text is added to the prompt, and the embeddings (soft prompts) or token indices (hard prompts) of the prefix/suffix are optimized to gain more control over language models for specific tasks. This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01606v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first gradient-based framework for prompt optimization in text-to-image diffusion models. We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

| **[Autonomous Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11000v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a crucial yet challenging task for optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on customized tasks. This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET), which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts, resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4% increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a significant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16743v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04155v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO. Code and datasets are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/BPO.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |
| **[APEER: Automatic Prompt Engineering Enhances Large Language Model Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14449v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced Information Retrieval (IR) across various modules, such as reranking. Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |

The method depends on generating synthetic queries for documents using a language model (LM), and the key step is that we automatically optimize the LM prompt that is used to generate these queries based on training quality. In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Batch-Instructed Gradient for Prompt Evolution:Systematic Prompt Optimization for Enhanced Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08713v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images from user-provided prompts. Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[POS: A Prompts Optimization Suite for Augmenting Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00949v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper targets to enhance the diffusion-based text-to-video generation by improving the two input prompts, including the noise and the text. Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |
