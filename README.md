| **[Motion Code: Robust Time Series Classification and Forecasting via Sparse Variational Multi-Stochastic Processes Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14081v3)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive research, time series classification and forecasting on noisy data remain highly challenging. The main difficulties lie in finding suitable mathematical concepts to describe time series and effectively separate noise from the true signals. Unlike traditional methods treating time series as static vectors or fixed sequences, we propose a novel framework that views each time series, regardless of length, as a realization of a continuous-time stochastic process. This mathematical approach captures dependencies across timestamps and detects hidden, time-varying signals within the noise. However, real-world data often involves multiple distinct dynamics, making it insufficient to model the entire process with a single stochastic model. To address this, we assign each dynamic a unique signature vector and introduce the concept of "most informative timestamps" to infer a sparse approximation of the individual dynamics from these vectors. The resulting model, called Motion Code, includes parameters that fully capture diverse underlying dynamics in an integrated manner, enabling simultaneous classification and forecasting of time series. Extensive experiments on noisy datasets, including real-world Parkinson's disease sensor tracking, demonstrate Motion Code's strong performance against established benchmarks for time series classification and forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[CatNet: Effective FDR Control in LSTM with Gaussian Mirrors and SHAP Feature Importance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16666v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CatNet, an algorithm that effectively controls False Discovery Rate (FDR) and selects significant features in LSTM with the Gaussian Mirror (GM) method. To evaluate the feature importance of LSTM in time series, we introduce a vector of the derivative of the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to measure feature importance. We also propose a new kernel-based dependence measure to avoid multicollinearity in the GM algorithm, to make a robust feature selection with controlled FDR. We use simulated data to evaluate CatNet's performance in both linear models and LSTM models with different link functions. The algorithm effectively controls the FDR while maintaining a high statistical power in all cases. We also evaluate the algorithm's performance in different low-dimensional and high-dimensional cases, demonstrating its robustness in various input dimensions. To evaluate CatNet's performance in real world applications, we construct a multi-factor investment portfolio to forecast the prices of S\&P 500 index components. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional LSTM models without feature selection and FDR control. Additionally, CatNet effectively captures common market-driving features, which helps informed decision-making in financial markets by enhancing the interpretability of predictions. Our study integrates of the Gaussian Mirror algorithm with LSTM models for the first time, and introduces SHAP values as a new feature importance metric for FDR control methods, marking a significant advancement in feature selection and error control for neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dataset for Evaluating Online Anomaly Detection Approaches for Discrete Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951v2)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Reliability journal</p></details> |
| **[Machine learning for cerebral blood vessels' malformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16349v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations are life-threatening hemodynamic pathologies of the brain. While surgical intervention is often essential to prevent fatal outcomes, it carries significant risks both during the procedure and in the postoperative period, making the management of these conditions highly challenging. Parameters of cerebral blood flow, routinely monitored during medical interventions, could potentially be utilized in machine learning-assisted protocols for risk assessment and therapeutic prognosis. To this end, we developed a linear oscillatory model of blood velocity and pressure for clinical data acquired from neurosurgical operations. Using the method of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the parameters of our model can be reconstructed online within milliseconds from a short time series of the hemodynamic variables. The identified parameter values enable automated classification of the blood-flow pathologies by means of logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 73 %. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model for both diagnostic and prognostic applications, providing a robust and interpretable framework for assessing cerebral blood vessel conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 main figures, 5 supplementary figures, 2 supplementary tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Critical Care Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16346v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Notable progress has been made in generalist medical large language models across various healthcare areas. However, large-scale modeling of in-hospital time series data - such as vital signs, lab results, and treatments in critical care - remains underexplored. Existing datasets are relatively small, but combining them can enhance patient diversity and improve model robustness. To effectively utilize these combined datasets for large-scale modeling, it is essential to address the distribution shifts caused by varying treatment policies, necessitating the harmonization of treatment variables across the different datasets. This work aims to establish a foundation for training large-scale multi-variate time series models on critical care data and to provide a benchmark for machine learning models in transfer learning across hospitals to study and address distribution shift challenges. We introduce a harmonized dataset for sequence modeling and transfer learning research, representing the first large-scale collection to include core treatment variables. Future plans involve expanding this dataset to support further advancements in transfer learning and the development of scalable, generalizable models for critical healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at AIM-FM Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[OrionBench: Benchmarking Time Series Generative Models in the Service of the End-User](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17748v3)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is a vital task in many domains, including patient monitoring in healthcare, forecasting in finance, and predictive maintenance in energy industries. This has led to a proliferation of anomaly detection methods, including deep learning-based methods. Benchmarks are essential for comparing the performances of these models as they emerge, in a fair, rigorous, and reproducible approach. Although several benchmarks for comparing models have been proposed, these usually rely on a one-time execution over a limited set of datasets, with comparisons restricted to a few models. We propose OrionBench: an end-user centric, continuously maintained benchmarking framework for unsupervised time series anomaly detection models. Our framework provides universal abstractions to represent models, hyperparameter standardization, extensibility to add new pipelines and datasets, pipeline verification, and frequent releases with published updates of the benchmark. We demonstrate how to use OrionBench, and the performance of pipelines across 17 releases published over the course of four years. We also walk through two real scenarios we experienced with OrionBench that highlight the importance of continuous benchmarking for unsupervised time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted by IEEE BigData 2024</p></details> |
| **[Incorporating Metabolic Information into LLMs for Anomaly Detection in Clinical Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12830v3)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in clinical time-series holds significant potential in identifying suspicious patterns in different biological parameters. In this paper, we propose a targeted method that incorporates the clinical domain knowledge into LLMs to improve their ability to detect anomalies. We introduce the Metabolism Pathway-driven Prompting (MPP) method, which integrates the information about metabolic pathways to better capture the structural and temporal changes in biological samples. We applied our method for doping detection in sports, focusing on steroid metabolism, and evaluated using real-world data from athletes. The results show that our method improves anomaly detection performance by leveraging metabolic context, providing a more nuanced and accurate prediction of suspicious samples in athletes' profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical Mode Recognition of Coupled Flame Oscillators by Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17801v3)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combustion instability in gas turbines and rocket engines, as one of the most challenging problems in combustion research, arises from the complex interactions among flames, which are also influenced by chemical reactions, heat and mass transfer, and acoustics. Identifying and understanding combustion instability is essential to ensure the safe and reliable operation of many combustion systems, where exploring and classifying the dynamical behaviors of complex flame systems is a core take. To facilitate fundamental studies, the present work concerns dynamical mode recognition of coupled flame oscillators made of flickering buoyant diffusion flames, which have gained increasing attention in recent years but are not sufficiently understood. The time series data of flame oscillators are generated by fully validated reacting flow simulations. Due to limitations of expertise-based models, a data-driven approach is adopted. In this study, a nonlinear dimensional reduction model of variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to project the simulation data onto a 2-dimensional latent space. Based on the phase trajectories in latent space, both supervised and unsupervised classifiers are proposed for datasets with well known labeling and without, respectively. For labeled datasets, we establish the Wasserstein-distance-based classifier (WDC) for mode recognition; for unlabeled datasets, we develop a novel unsupervised classifier (GMM-DTWC) combining dynamic time warping (DTW) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Through comparing with conventional approaches for dimensionality reduction and classification, the proposed supervised and unsupervised VAE-based approaches exhibit a prominent performance for distinguishing dynamical modes, implying their potential extension to dynamical mode recognition of complex combustion problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>resea...</summary><p>research paper (29 pages, 20 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Data Scarcity: A Frequency-Driven Framework for Zero-Shot Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15743v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is critical in numerous real-world applications, requiring accurate predictions of future values based on observed patterns. While traditional forecasting techniques work well in in-domain scenarios with ample data, they struggle when data is scarce or not available at all, motivating the emergence of zero-shot and few-shot learning settings. Recent advancements often leverage large-scale foundation models for such tasks, but these methods require extensive data and compute resources, and their performance may be hindered by ineffective learning from the available training set. This raises a fundamental question: What factors influence effective learning from data in time series forecasting? Toward addressing this, we propose using Fourier analysis to investigate how models learn from synthetic and real-world time series data. Our findings reveal that forecasters commonly suffer from poor learning from data with multiple frequencies and poor generalization to unseen frequencies, which impedes their predictive performance. To alleviate these issues, we present a novel synthetic data generation framework, designed to enhance real data or replace it completely by creating task-specific frequency information, requiring only the sampling rate of the target data. Our approach, Freq-Synth, improves the robustness of both foundation as well as nonfoundation forecast models in zero-shot and few-shot settings, facilitating more reliable time series forecasting under limited data scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[TableTime: Reformulating Time Series Classification as Zero-Shot Table Understanding via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15737v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tackling Data Heterogeneity in Federated Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15716v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a critical role in various real-world applications, including energy consumption prediction, disease transmission monitoring, and weather forecasting. Although substantial progress has been made in time series forecasting, most existing methods rely on a centralized training paradigm, where large amounts of data are collected from distributed devices (e.g., sensors, wearables) to a central cloud server. However, this paradigm has overloaded communication networks and raised privacy concerns. Federated learning, a popular privacy-preserving technique, enables collaborative model training across distributed data sources. However, directly applying federated learning to time series forecasting often yields suboptimal results, as time series data generated by different devices are inherently heterogeneous. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Fed-TREND, to address data heterogeneity by generating informative synthetic data as auxiliary knowledge carriers. Specifically, Fed-TREND generates two types of synthetic data. The first type of synthetic data captures the representative distribution information from clients' uploaded model updates and enhances clients' local training consensus. The second kind of synthetic data extracts long-term influence insights from global model update trajectories and is used to refine the global model after aggregation. Fed-TREND is compatible with most time series forecasting models and can be seamlessly integrated into existing federated learning frameworks to improve prediction performance. Extensive experiments on eight datasets, using several federated learning baselines and four popular time series forecasting models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of Fed-TREND.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantile deep learning models for multi-step ahead time series prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15674v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification is crucial in time series prediction, and quantile regression offers a valuable mechanism for uncertainty quantification which is useful for extreme value forecasting. Although deep learning models have been prominent in multi-step ahead prediction, the development and evaluation of quantile deep learning models have been limited. We present a novel quantile regression deep learning framework for multi-step time series prediction. In this way, we elevate the capabilities of deep learning models by incorporating quantile regression, thus providing a more nuanced understanding of predictive values. We provide an implementation of prominent deep learning models for multi-step ahead time series prediction and evaluate their performance under high volatility and extreme conditions. We include multivariate and univariate modelling, strategies and provide a comparison with conventional deep learning models from the literature. Our models are tested on two cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum, using daily close-price data and selected benchmark time series datasets. The results show that integrating a quantile loss function with deep learning provides additional predictions for selected quantiles without a loss in the prediction accuracy when compared to the literature. Our quantile model has the ability to handle volatility more effectively and provides additional information for decision-making and uncertainty quantification through the use of quantiles when compared to conventional deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Generation of Privacy-preserving Synthetic Electronic Health Record Time Series via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15290v5)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are rich sources of patient-level data, offering valuable resources for medical data analysis. However, privacy concerns often restrict access to EHRs, hindering downstream analysis. Current EHR de-identification methods are flawed and can lead to potential privacy leakage. Additionally, existing publicly available EHR databases are limited, preventing the advancement of medical research using EHR. This study aims to overcome these challenges by generating realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) time series efficiently. We introduce a new method for generating diverse and realistic synthetic EHR time series data using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). We conducted experiments on six databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV (MIMIC-III/IV), the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU), and non-EHR datasets on Stocks and Energy. We compared our proposed method with eight existing methods. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of data fidelity while requiring less training effort. Additionally, data generated by our method yields a lower discriminative accuracy compared to other baseline methods, indicating the proposed method can generate data with less privacy risk. The proposed diffusion-model-based method can reliably and efficiently generate synthetic EHR time series, which facilitates the downstream medical data analysis. Our numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over all other existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Latent Neural Dynamics with Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03330v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how the collective activity of neural populations relates to computation and ultimately behavior is a key goal in neuroscience. To this end, statistical methods which describe high-dimensional neural time series in terms of low-dimensional latent dynamics have played a fundamental role in characterizing neural systems. Yet, what constitutes a successful method involves two opposing criteria: (1) methods should be expressive enough to capture complex nonlinear dynamics, and (2) they should maintain a notion of interpretability often only warranted by simpler linear models. In this paper, we develop an approach that balances these two objectives: the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS). Our method builds on previous work modeling the latent state evolution via a stochastic differential equation whose nonlinear dynamics are described by a Gaussian process (GP-SDEs). We propose a novel kernel function which enforces smoothly interpolated locally linear dynamics, and therefore expresses flexible -- yet interpretable -- dynamics akin to those of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS). Our approach resolves key limitations of the rSLDS such as artifactual oscillations in dynamics near discrete state boundaries, while also providing posterior uncertainty estimates of the dynamics. To fit our models, we leverage a modified learning objective which improves the estimation accuracy of kernel hyperparameters compared to previous GP-SDE fitting approaches. We apply our method to synthetic data and data recorded in two neuroscience experiments and demonstrate favorable performance in comparison to the rSLDS.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Nd-BiMamba2: A Unified Bidirectional Architecture for Multi-Dimensional Data Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15380v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models often require specially designed architectures to process data of different dimensions, such as 1D time series, 2D images, and 3D volumetric data. Existing bidirectional models mainly focus on sequential data, making it difficult to scale effectively to higher dimensions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-dimensional bidirectional neural network architecture, named Nd-BiMamba2, which efficiently handles 1D, 2D, and 3D data. Nd-BiMamba2 is based on the Mamba2 module and introduces innovative bidirectional processing mechanisms and adaptive padding strategies to capture bidirectional information in multi-dimensional data while maintaining computational efficiency. Unlike existing methods that require designing specific architectures for different dimensional data, Nd-BiMamba2 adopts a unified architecture with a modular design, simplifying development and maintenance costs. To verify the portability and flexibility of Nd-BiMamba2, we successfully exported it to ONNX and TorchScript and tested it on different hardware platforms (e.g., CPU, GPU, and mobile devices). Experimental results show that Nd-BiMamba2 runs efficiently on multiple platforms, demonstrating its potential in practical applications. The code is open-source: https://github.com/Human9000/nd-Mamba2-torch</p></details> |  |
| **[Point process analysis of geographical diffusion of news in Argentina](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19552v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion of information plays a crucial role in a society, affecting its economy and the well-being of the population. Characterizing the diffusion process is challenging because it is highly non-stationary and varies with the media type. To understand the spreading of newspaper news in Argentina, we collected data from more than 27000 articles published in six main provinces during four months. We classified the articles into 20 thematic axes and obtained a set of time series that capture daily newspaper attention on different topics in different provinces. To analyze the data we use a point process approach. For each topic, $n$, and for all pairs of provinces, $i$ and $j$, we use two measures to quantify the synchronicity of the events, $Q_s(i,j)$, which quantifies the number of events that occur almost simultaneously in $i$ and $j$, and $Q_a(i,j)$, which quantifies the direction of news spreading. Our analysis unveils how fast the information diffusion process is, showing pairs of provinces with very similar and almost simultaneous temporal variations of media attention. On the other hand, we also calculate other measures computed from the raw time series, such as Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, which do not perform well in this context because they often return opposite directions of information transfer. We interpret this as due to different factors such as the characteristics of the data, which is highly non-stationary and the features of the information diffusion process, which is very fast and probably acts at a sub-resolution time scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Interpretable Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14904v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification is a relevant step supporting decision-making processes in various domains, and deep neural models have shown promising performance. Despite significant advancements in deep learning, the theoretical understanding of how and why complex architectures function remains limited, prompting the need for more interpretable models. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as a more interpretable alternative. While KAN-related research is significantly rising, to date, the study of KAN architectures for time series classification has been limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive and robust exploration of the KAN architecture for time series classification on the UCR benchmark. More specifically, we look at a) how reference architectures for forecasting transfer to classification, at the b) hyperparameter and implementation influence on the classification performance in view of finding the one that performs best on the selected benchmark, the c) complexity trade-offs and d) interpretability advantages. Our results show that (1) Efficient KAN outperforms MLP in performance and computational efficiency, showcasing its suitability for tasks classification tasks. (2) Efficient KAN is more stable than KAN across grid sizes, depths, and layer configurations, particularly with lower learning rates. (3) KAN maintains competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models like HIVE-COTE2, with smaller architectures and faster training times, supporting its balance of performance and transparency. (4) The interpretability of the KAN model aligns with findings from SHAP analysis, reinforcing its capacity for transparent decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Fourier Signature Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12214v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor algebras give rise to one of the most powerful measures of similarity for sequences of arbitrary length called the signature kernel accompanied with attractive theoretical guarantees from stochastic analysis. Previous algorithms to compute the signature kernel scale quadratically in terms of the length and the number of the sequences. To mitigate this severe computational bottleneck, we develop a random Fourier feature-based acceleration of the signature kernel acting on the inherently non-Euclidean domain of sequences. We show uniform approximation guarantees for the proposed unbiased estimator of the signature kernel, while keeping its computation linear in the sequence length and number. In addition, combined with recent advances on tensor projections, we derive two even more scalable time series features with favourable concentration properties and computational complexity both in time and memory. Our empirical results show that the reduction in computational cost comes at a negligible price in terms of accuracy on moderate-sized datasets, and it enables one to scale to large datasets up to a million time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Energy Management Framework for Multi-Timescale Forecasting in Smart Grids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15254v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of the electrical load, such as the magnitude and the timing of peak power, is crucial to successful power system management and implementation of smart grid strategies like demand response and peak shaving. In multi-time-scale optimization scheduling, rolling optimization is a common solution. However, rolling optimization needs to consider the coupling of different optimization objectives across time scales. It is challenging to accurately capture the mid- and long-term dependencies in time series data. This paper proposes Multi-pofo, a multi-scale power load forecasting framework, that captures such dependency via a novel architecture equipped with a temporal positional encoding layer. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct experiments on real-world electricity load data. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms compared to several strong baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PES GM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Stable Neural Stochastic Differential Equations in Analyzing Irregular Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14989v5)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular sampling intervals and missing values in real-world time series data present challenges for conventional methods that assume consistent intervals and complete data. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024), Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%). https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |
| **[ArrivalNet: Predicting City-wide Bus/Tram Arrival Time with Two-dimensional Temporal Variation Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14742v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate arrival time prediction (ATP) of buses and trams plays a crucial role in public transport operations. Current methods focused on modeling one-dimensional temporal information but overlooked the latent periodic information within time series. Moreover, most studies developed algorithms for ATP based on a single or a few routes of public transport, which reduces the transferability of the prediction models and their applicability in public transport management systems. To this end, this paper proposes \textit{ArrivalNet}, a two-dimensional temporal variation-based multi-step ATP for buses and trams. It decomposes the one-dimensional temporal sequence into intra-periodic and inter-periodic variations, which can be recast into two-dimensional tensors (2D blocks). Each row of a tensor contains the time points within a period, and each column involves the time points at the same intra-periodic index across various periods. The transformed 2D blocks in different frequencies have an image-like feature representation that enables effective learning with computer vision backbones (e.g., convolutional neural network). Drawing on the concept of residual neural network, the 2D block module is designed as a basic module for flexible aggregation. Meanwhile, contextual factors like workdays, peak hours, and intersections, are also utilized in the augmented feature representation to improve the performance of prediction. 125 days of public transport data from Dresden were collected for model training and validation. Experimental results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of the proposed predictor decrease by at least 6.1\%, 14.7\%, and 34.2\% compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Con4m: Context-aware Consistency Learning Framework for Segmented Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00041v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Classification (TSC) encompasses two settings: classifying entire sequences or classifying segmented subsequences. The raw time series for segmented TSC usually contain Multiple classes with Varying Duration of each class (MVD). Therefore, the characteristics of MVD pose unique challenges for segmented TSC, yet have been largely overlooked by existing works. Specifically, there exists a natural temporal dependency between consecutive instances (segments) to be classified within MVD. However, mainstream TSC models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), focusing on independently modeling each segment. Additionally, annotators with varying expertise may provide inconsistent boundary labels, leading to unstable performance of noise-free TSC models. To address these challenges, we first formally demonstrate that valuable contextual information enhances the discriminative power of classification instances. Leveraging the contextual priors of MVD at both the data and label levels, we propose a novel consistency learning framework Con4m, which effectively utilizes contextual information more conducive to discriminating consecutive segments in segmented TSC tasks, while harmonizing inconsistent boundary labels for training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of Con4m in handling segmented TSC tasks on MVD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive Gaussian Process State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14679v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Introducing Spectral Attention for Long-Range Dependency in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20772v3)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence modeling faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies across diverse tasks. Recent linear and transformer-based forecasters have shown superior performance in time series forecasting. However, they are constrained by their inherent inability to effectively address long-range dependencies in time series data, primarily due to using fixed-size inputs for prediction. Furthermore, they typically sacrifice essential temporal correlation among consecutive training samples by shuffling them into mini-batches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fast and effective Spectral Attention mechanism, which preserves temporal correlations among samples and facilitates the handling of long-range information while maintaining the base model structure. Spectral Attention preserves long-period trends through a low-pass filter and facilitates gradient to flow between samples. Spectral Attention can be seamlessly integrated into most sequence models, allowing models with fixed-sized look-back windows to capture long-range dependencies over thousands of steps. Through extensive experiments on 11 real-world time series datasets using 7 recent forecasting models, we consistently demonstrate the efficacy of our Spectral Attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Co-fi...</summary><p>Co-first Author: Bong Gyun Kang, Dongjun Lee.

While smart meters and deep learning models enable forecasting using past data from multiple buildings, data heterogeneity from diverse buildings can reduce model performance. The impact of increasing dataset heterogeneity in time series forecasting, while keeping size and model constant, is understudied. We tackle this issue using the ComStock dataset, which provides synthetic energy consumption data for U.S. commercial buildings. Two curated subsets, identical in size and region but differing in building type diversity, are used to assess the performance of various time series forecasting models, including fine-tuned open-source foundation models (FMs). The results show that dataset heterogeneity and model architecture have a greater impact on post-training forecasting performance than the parameter count. Moreover, despite the higher computational cost, fine-tuned FMs demonstrate competitive performance compared to base models trained from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Time Series in the Age of Large Models</p></details> |

Transformers are a relatively new deep learning architecture, which has served as the foundation for groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT. While TL has been studied in the past, prior studies considered either one data-centric TL strategy or used older deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks. Here, we carry out an extensive empirical study on six different data-centric TL strategies and analyse their performance under varying feature spaces. In addition to the vanilla Transformer architecture, we also experiment with Informer and PatchTST, specifically designed for time series forecasting. We use 16 datasets from the Building Data Genome Project 2 to create building energy consumption forecasting models. Experimental results reveal that while TL is generally beneficial, especially when the target domain has no data, careful selection of the exact TL strategy should be made to gain the maximum benefit. This decision largely depends on the feature space properties such as the recorded weather features. We also note that PatchTST outperforms the other two Transformer variants (vanilla Transformer and Informer). Our findings advance the building energy consumption forecasting using advanced approaches like TL and Transformer architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveRoRA: Wavelet Rotary Route Attention for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22649v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved significant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However, previous works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the frequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework to model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet domain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the analysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally, the Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic complexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing long-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism: Rotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary position embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence tokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate information from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix, offering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA to capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that WaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower computational costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leopold2333/WaveRoRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Model architecture changed</p></details> |
| **[On the Use of Relative Validity Indices for Comparing Clustering Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10351v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relative Validity Indices (RVIs) such as the Silhouette Width Criterion and Davies Bouldin indices are the most widely used tools for evaluating and optimising clustering outcomes. Traditionally, their ability to rank collections of candidate dataset partitions has been used to guide the selection of the number of clusters, and to compare partitions from different clustering algorithms. However, there is a growing trend in the literature to use RVIs when selecting a Similarity Paradigm (SP) for clustering - the combination of normalisation procedure, representation method, and distance measure which affects the computation of object dissimilarities used in clustering. Despite the growing prevalence of this practice, there has been no empirical or theoretical investigation into the suitability of RVIs for this purpose. Moreover, since RVIs are computed using object dissimilarities, it remains unclear how they would need to be implemented for fair comparisons of different SPs. This study presents the first comprehensive investigation into the reliability of RVIs for SP selection. We conducted extensive experiments with seven popular RVIs on over 2.7 million clustering partitions of synthetic and real-world datasets, encompassing feature-vector and time-series data. We identified fundamental conceptual limitations undermining the use of RVIs for SP selection, and our empirical findings confirmed this predicted unsuitability. Among our recommendations, we suggest instead that practitioners select SPs by using external validation on high quality labelled datasets or carefully designed outcome-oriented objective criteria, both of which should be informed by careful consideration of dataset characteristics, and domain requirements. Our findings have important implications for clustering methodology and evaluation, suggesting the need for more rigorous approaches to SP selection.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop TimeText Corpus (TTC), a carefully curated, time-aligned text and time dataset for multimodal forecasting. Our dataset is composed of sequences of numbers and text aligned to timestamps, and includes data from two different domains: climate science and healthcare. Our data is a significant contribution to the rare selection of available multimodal datasets. We also propose the Hybrid Multi-Modal Forecaster (Hybrid-MMF), a multimodal LLM that jointly forecasts both text and time series data using shared embeddings. However, contrary to our expectations, our Hybrid-MMF model does not outperform existing baselines in our experiments. This negative result highlights the challenges inherent in multimodal forecasting.

| **[Fast Machine-Precision Spectral Likelihoods for Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16583v3)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide in this work an algorithm for approximating a very broad class of symmetric Toeplitz matrices to machine precision in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time with applications to fitting time series models. In particular, for a symmetric Toeplitz matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with values $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{j,k} = h_{|j-k|} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2 \pi i |j-k| \omega} S(\omega) \mathrm{d} \omega$ where $S(\omega)$ is piecewise smooth, we give an approximation $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^H \approx \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^H$, where $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}$ is the DFT matrix, $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, and the matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times r}$ with $r \ll n$. Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank $r = 2$ to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy of the log-likelihood approximation from $3$ to $14$ digits for a matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{10^5 \times 10^5}$. The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate solutions to linear systems with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices whose entries are generated by a piecewise smooth $S(\omega)$. The analysis employed here largely depends on asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals, and also provides a new perspective on when existing spectral-domain approximation methods for Gaussian log-likelihoods can be particularly problematic.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisTR: Visualizations as Representations for Time-series Table Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03753v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table reasoning involves transforming natural language questions into corresponding answers based on the provided data table. Recent research exploits large language models (LLMs) to facilitate table reasoning, which however struggle with pattern recognition and lack support for visual-based pattern exploration. To address these limitations, we propose VisTR, a framework that leverages visualizations as representations to facilitate data pattern recognition and support cross-modal exploration. We describe VisTR as a process consisting of four major modules: 1) visualization alignment that utilizes multimodal LLMs to align visualizations across various modalities, including chart, text, and sketch; 2) visualization referencing that decomposes a table into multifaceted visualization references that comprehensively represent the table; 3) visualization pruning that incorporates data and retrieval pruning to excise visualization references with poor information and enhance retrieval efficiency; and 4) visualization interaction that offers an interactive visual interface with multimodal interactions for user-friendly table reasoning. Quantitative evaluation with existing multimodal LLMs demonstrates the effectiveness of the alignment model in cross-modal visualization pairings. We further illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework in various time-series table reasoning and exploration tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

However, there is still a lack of understanding of the theoretical properties of probabilistic Forecast Reconciliation techniques. Meanwhile, Conformal Prediction is a general framework with growing appeal that provides prediction sets with probabilistic guarantees in finite sample. In this paper, we propose a first step towards combining Conformal Prediction and Forecast Reconciliation by analyzing how including a reconciliation step in the Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) procedure enhances the resulting prediction sets. In particular, we show that the validity granted by SCP remains while improving the efficiency of the prediction sets. We also advocate a variation of the theoretical procedure for practical use. Finally, we illustrate these results with simulations.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |

| **[Generation of synthetic gait data: application to multiple sclerosis patients' gait patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10377v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading cause of severe non-traumatic disability in young adults and its incidence is increasing worldwide. The variability of gait impairment in MS necessitates the development of a non-invasive, sensitive, and cost-effective tool for quantitative gait evaluation. The eGait movement sensor, designed to characterize human gait through unit quaternion time series (QTS) representing hip rotations, is a promising approach. However, the small sample sizes typical of clinical studies pose challenges for the stability of gait data analysis tools. To address these challenges, this article presents two key scientific contributions. First, a comprehensive framework is proposed for transforming QTS data into a form that preserves the essential geometric properties of gait while enabling the use of any tabular synthetic data generation method. Second, a synthetic data generation method is introduced, based on nearest neighbors weighting, which produces high-fidelity synthetic QTS data suitable for small datasets and private data environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method, is demonstrated through its application to MS gait data, showing very good fidelity and respect of the initial geometry of the data. Thanks to this work, we are able to produce synthetic data sets and work on the stability of clustering methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers with Sparse Attention for Granger Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13264v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal causal analysis means understanding the underlying causes behind observed variables over time. Deep learning based methods such as transformers are increasingly used to capture temporal dynamics and causal relationships beyond mere correlations. Recent works suggest self-attention weights of transformers as a useful indicator of causal links. We leverage this to propose a novel modification to the self-attention module to establish causal links between the variables of multivariate time-series data with varying lag dependencies. Our Sparse Attention Transformer captures causal relationships using a two-fold approach - performing temporal attention first followed by attention between the variables across the time steps masking them individually to compute Granger Causality indices. The key novelty in our approach is the ability of the model to assert importance and pick the most significant past time instances for its prediction task against manually feeding a fixed time lag value. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via extensive experimentation on several synthetic benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our model with the traditional Vector Autoregression based Granger Causality method that assumes fixed lag length.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantized symbolic time series approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15209v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series are ubiquitous in numerous science and engineering domains, e.g., signal processing, bioinformatics, and astronomy. Previous work has verified the efficacy of symbolic time series representation in a variety of engineering applications due to its storage efficiency and numerosity reduction. The most recent symbolic aggregate approximation technique, ABBA, has been shown to preserve essential shape information of time series and improve downstream applications, e.g., neural network inference regarding prediction and anomaly detection in time series. Motivated by the emergence of high-performance hardware which enables efficient computation for low bit-width representations, we present a new quantization-based ABBA symbolic approximation technique, QABBA, which exhibits improved storage efficiency while retaining the original speed and accuracy of symbolic reconstruction. We prove an upper bound for the error arising from quantization and discuss how the number of bits should be chosen to balance this with other errors. An application of QABBA with large language models (LLMs) for time series regression is also presented, and its utility is investigated. By representing the symbolic chain of patterns on time series, QABBA not only avoids the training of embedding from scratch, but also achieves a new state-of-the-art on Monash regression dataset. The symbolic approximation to the time series offers a more efficient way to fine-tune LLMs on the time series regression task which contains various application domains. We further present a set of extensive experiments performed across various well-established datasets to demonstrate the advantages of the QABBA method for symbolic approximation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSINR: Capturing Temporal Continuity via Implicit Neural Representations for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11641v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in data or deviations from systems' expected behavior. The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Due to the abundant seasonal information they contain, timestamps possess the potential to offer robust global guidance for forecasting techniques. However, existing works primarily focus on local observations, with timestamps being treated merely as an optional supplement that remains underutilized. When data gathered from the real world is polluted, the absence of global information will damage the robust prediction capability of these algorithms. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named GLAFF. Within this framework, the timestamps are modeled individually to capture the global dependencies. Working as a plugin, GLAFF adaptively adjusts the combined weights for global and local information, enabling seamless collaboration with any time series forecasting backbone. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that GLAFF significantly enhances the average performance of widely used mainstream forecasting models by 12.5%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by 5.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, to date, there has been limited work demonstrating how well these models perform in medical applications, where labeled data can be scarce. Further, we observe that currently, the majority of time series foundation models either are univariate in nature, or assume channel independence, meaning that they handle multivariate time series but do not model how the different variables relate. In this paper, we propose a prompt-tuning-inspired fine-tuning technique, Generalized Prompt Tuning (Gen-P-Tuning), that enables us to adapt an existing univariate time series foundation model (treated as frozen) to handle multivariate time series prediction. Our approach provides a way to combine information across channels (variables) of multivariate time series.

It consists of two crucial steps: initially predicting unknown parameters of an optimization model and subsequently solving the problem based on these predictions. Elmachtoub and Grigas [1] introduced the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss for the framework, which gauges the decision error arising from predicted parameters, and a convex surrogate, the SPO+ loss, which incorporates the underlying structure of the optimization model. The consistency of these different loss functions is guaranteed under the assumption of i.i.d. training data. Nevertheless, various types of data are often dependent, such as power load fluctuations over time. This dependent nature can lead to diminished model performance in testing or real-world applications. Motivated to make intelligent predictions for time series data, we present an autoregressive SPO method directly targeting the optimization problem at the decision stage in this paper, where the conditions of consistency are no longer met. Therefore, we first analyze the generalization bounds of the SPO loss within our autoregressive model. Subsequently, the uniform calibration results in Liu and Grigas [2] are extended in the proposed model. Finally, we conduct experiments to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the SPO+ surrogate compared to the absolute loss and the least squares loss, especially when the cost vectors are determined by stationary dynamical systems and demonstrate the relationship between normalized regret and mixing coefficients.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |

Despite its benefits, MNA necessitates extensive groundwater monitoring to ensure that contaminant levels decrease to meet safety standards. This study expands the capabilities of PyLEnM, a Python package designed for long-term environmental monitoring, by incorporating new algorithms to enhance its predictive and analytical functionalities. We introduce methods to estimate the timeframe required for contaminants like Sr-90 and I-129 to reach regulatory safety standards using linear regression and to forecast future contaminant levels with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. Additionally, Random Forest regression is employed to identify factors influencing the time to reach safety standards. Our methods are illustrated using data from the Savannah River Site (SRS) F-Area, where preliminary findings reveal a notable downward trend in contaminant levels, with variability linked to initial concentrations and groundwater flow dynamics. The Bi-LSTM model effectively predicts contaminant concentrations for the next four years, demonstrating the potential of advanced time series analysis to improve MNA strategies and reduce reliance on manual groundwater sampling.

First, Ichnos takes as input the automatically-generated workflow trace produced by Nextflow. Use of these traces is an original contribution, ensuring that users do not need to manually monitor power consumption and enabling analysis of previously executed workflows. Next, Ichnos allows users to provide their own resource power model for utilised compute resources to accurately reflect processor settings, such as the processor frequency, instead of solely relying on a linear function. Finally, Ichnos converts estimated energy consumption to overall carbon emissions using fine-grained time-series CI data for each workflow task and only resorts to coarse-grained yearly averages where high-resolution location-based CI data are not available. Additionally, Ichnos reports estimated energy consumption and carbon emissions per task, providing greater granularity than existing methodologies and allowing users to identify which of their tasks have the largest footprint to address. We provide the implementation of Ichnos as open-source. We demonstrate our tool on traces of two real-world Nextflow workflows, compare the estimated energy consumption against RAPL and the GA methodology, and show the tool's functionality by varying the granularity of provided CI data and varying the processor frequency settings of assigned compute resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended Abstract for LOCO 2024.

| **[Extending the Burrows-Wheeler Transform for Cartesian Tree Matching and Constructing It](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12241v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cartesian tree matching is a form of generalized pattern matching where a substring of the text matches with the pattern if they share the same Cartesian tree. This form of matching finds application for time series of stock prices and can be of interest for melody matching between musical scores. For the indexing problem, the state-of-the-art data structure is a Burrows-Wheeler transform based solution due to [Kim and Cho, CPM'21], which uses nearly succinct space and can count the number of substrings that Cartesian tree match with a pattern in time linear in the pattern length. The authors address the construction of their data structure with a straight-forward solution that, however, requires pointer-based data structures, which asymptotically need more space than compact solutions [Kim and Cho, CPM'21, Section A.4]. We address this bottleneck by a construction that requires compact space and has a time complexity linear in the product of the text length with some logarithmic terms. Additionally, we can extend this index for indexing multiple circular texts in the spirit of the extended Burrows-Wheeler transform without sacrificing the time and space complexities. We present this index in a dynamic variant, where we pay a logarithmic slowdown and need compact space for the extra functionality that we can incrementally add texts. Our extended setting is of interest for finding repetitive motifs common in the aforementioned applications, independent of offsets and scaling.</p></details> |  |

Over the past few years, many studies have explored the long-range dependencies and similarities in MTS. However, long-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes and high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively and efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba). Firstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use temporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we construct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and short-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the information interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity features, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments on multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass diverse application scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method through both supervised and semi-supervised experiments on the MTS classification task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Knowledge-Based Systems on Nov 17, 2024</p></details> |

While recent advancements have improved RUL prediction, many models still face interpretability and compelling uncertainty modeling challenges. This paper introduces a modified Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model for RUL interval prediction, tailored for the complexities of manufacturing process development. The modified GPR predicts confidence intervals by learning from historical data and addresses uncertainty modeling in a more structured way. The approach effectively captures intricate time-series patterns and dynamic behaviors inherent in modern manufacturing systems by coupling GPR with deep adaptive learning-enhanced AI process models. Moreover, the model evaluates feature significance to ensure more transparent decision-making, which is crucial for optimizing manufacturing processes. This comprehensive approach supports more accurate RUL predictions and provides transparent, interpretable insights into uncertainty, contributing to robust process development and management.</p></details> |  |

Through comparative experiments with traditional algorithms (such as LRU and LFU) and other deep learning models (such as RNN, GRU-RNN and LSTM), the results show that the CNN-LSTM model has significant advantages in cache demand prediction. The MSE and MAE values of this model are significantly reduced, proving its effectiveness under complex data access patterns. This study not only verifies the potential of deep learning technology in storage system optimization, but also provides direction and reference for further optimizing and improving cache management strategies. This intelligent cache management strategy performs well in complex storage environments. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks and the time series modeling capabilities of long short-term memory networks, the CNN-LSTM model can more accurately predict cache needs, thereby Dynamically optimize cache allocation to improve system response speed and resource utilization. This research provides theoretical support and practical reference for cache optimization under large-scale data access modes, and is of great significance to improving the performance of future storage systems.</p></details> |  |

But, most of published ML based methodologies in this area have been limited to the tasks like candidate matching, job to skill matching, job classification and normalization. In this work, we discuss a novel task in the recruitment domain, namely, application count forecasting, motivation of which comes from designing of effective outreach activities to attract qualified applicants. We show that existing auto-regressive based time series forecasting methods perform poorly for this task. Henceforth, we propose a multimodal LM-based model which fuses job-posting metadata of various modalities through a simple encoder. Experiments from large real-life datasets from CareerBuilder LLC show the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Restoration of Missing Data in Optical Time-series Images with Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13358v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing images often suffer from substantial data loss due to factors such as thick cloud cover and sensor limitations. Existing methods for imputing missing values in remote sensing images fail to fully exploit spatiotemporal auxiliary information, which restricts the accuracy of their reconstructions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach called MS2TAN (Multi-Scale Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network) for reconstructing time-series remote sensing images. First, we introduce an efficient spatiotemporal feature extractor based on Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention (MSTA) to capture high-quality representations of spatiotemporal neighborhood features surrounding missing regions while significantly reducing the computational complexity of the attention mechanism. Second, a Multi-Scale Restoration Network composed of MSTA-based Feature Extractors is designed to progressively refine missing values by exploring spatiotemporal neighborhood features at different scales. Third, we propose a "Pixel-Structure-Perception" Multi-Objective Joint Optimization method to enhance the visual quality of the reconstructed results from multiple perspectives and to preserve more texture structures. Finally, quantitative experimental results under multi-temporal inputs on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms competitive approaches, achieving a 9.76%/9.30% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and a 0.56 dB/0.62 dB increase in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), along with stronger texture and structural consistency. Ablation experiments further validate the contribution of the core innovations to imputation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

One approach involves training LLM architectures on tokenized time series data using cross-entropy loss. Although this method has demonstrated promising results, cross-entropy loss is primarily designed for classification tasks and does not account for the distance between classes. To address this limitation, we propose using the Wasserstein loss for such architectures. To validate our approach, we fine-tuned a foundational time series model on $22$ zero-shot datasets, comparing the performance of cross-entropy loss with that of Wasserstein loss. Our results demonstrate that replacing cross-entropy loss with Wasserstein loss significantly improves point estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 mai...</summary><p>4 main pages; 2 figures</p></details> |

However, deep neural network models such as Transformers exhibit high accuracy in multivariate time series classification but lack interpretability and fail to provide insights into the decision-making process. On the other hand, traditional approaches based on decision tree classifiers offer clear decision processes but relatively lower accuracy. Swin Transformer (ST) addresses these issues by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture both fine-grained local patterns and global patterns. It can also model multi-scale feature representation learning, thereby providing a more comprehensive representation of time series features. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose ST-Tree with interpretability for multivariate time series classification. Specifically, the ST-Tree model combines ST as the backbone network with an additional neural tree model. This integration allows us to fully leverage the advantages of ST in learning time series context while providing interpretable decision processes through the neural tree. This enables researchers to gain clear insights into the model's decision-making process and extract meaningful interpretations. Through experimental evaluations on 10 UEA datasets, we demonstrate that the ST-Tree model improves accuracy in multivariate time series classification tasks and provides interpretability through visualizing the decision-making process across different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted on May 15, 2024, major revisions on Aug 31, 2024</p></details> |
| **[An Open-Source Tool for Mapping War Destruction at Scale in Ukraine using Sentinel-1 Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02506v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Access to detailed war impact assessments is crucial for humanitarian organizations to effectively assist populations most affected by armed conflicts. However, maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground is challenging, especially in conflicts that cover vast territories and extend over long periods. This study presents a scalable and transferable method for estimating war-induced damage to buildings. We first train a machine learning model to output pixel-wise probability of destruction from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite image time series, leveraging existing, manual damage assessments as ground truth and cloud-based geospatial analysis tools for large-scale inference. We further post-process these assessments using open building footprints to obtain a final damage estimate per building. We introduce an accessible, open-source tool that allows users to adjust the confidence interval based on their specific requirements and use cases. Our approach enables humanitarian organizations and other actors to rapidly screen large geographic regions for war impacts. We provide two publicly accessible dashboards: a Ukraine Damage Explorer to dynamically view our pre-computed estimates, and a Rapid Damage Mapping Tool to easily run our method and produce custom maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-ACL: A Time Series Analytic Continual Learning Framework for Privacy-Preserving and Class-Incremental Pattern Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15954v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental pattern recognition in time series is a significant problem, which aims to learn from continually arriving streaming data examples with incremental classes. A primary challenge in this problem is catastrophic forgetting, where the incorporation of new data samples causes the models to forget previously learned information. While the replay-based methods achieve promising results by storing historical data to address catastrophic forgetting, they come with the invasion of data privacy. On the other hand, the exemplar-free methods preserve privacy but suffer from significantly decreased accuracy. To address these challenges, we proposed TS-ACL, a novel Time Series Analytic Continual Learning framework for privacy-preserving and class-incremental pattern recognition. Identifying gradient descent as the root of catastrophic forgetting, TS-ACL transforms each update of the model into a gradient-free analytical learning process with a closed-form solution. By leveraging a pre-trained frozen encoder for embedding extraction, TS-ACL only needs to recursively update an analytic classifier in a lightweight manner. This way, TS-ACL simultaneously achieves non-forgetting, privacy preservation, and lightweight consumption, making it widely suitable for various applications, particularly in edge computing scenarios. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets confirm the superior and robust performance of TS-ACL compared to existing advanced methods. Code is available at https://github.com/asdasdczxczq/TS-ACL.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Hybrid Loss Framework for Decomposition-based Time Series Forecasting Methods: Balancing Global and Component Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11340v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time series forecasting, predicting future values based on past data, is crucial for diverse industries. Many current time series methods decompose time series into multiple sub-series, applying different model architectures and training with an end-to-end overall loss for forecasting. However, this raises a question: does this overall loss prioritize the importance of critical sub-series within the decomposition for the better performance? To investigate this, we conduct a study on the impact of overall loss on existing time series methods with sequence decomposition. Our findings reveal that overall loss may introduce bias in model learning, hindering the learning of the prioritization of more significant sub-series and limiting the forecasting performance. To address this, we propose a hybrid loss framework combining the global and component losses. This framework introduces component losses for each sub-series alongside the original overall loss. It employs a dual min-max algorithm to dynamically adjust weights between the overall loss and component losses, and within component losses. This enables the model to achieve better performance of current time series methods by focusing on more critical sub-series while still maintaining a low overall loss. We integrate our loss framework into several time series methods and evaluate the performance on multiple datasets. Results show an average improvement of 0.5-2% over existing methods without any modifications to the model architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks with Incremental Blocks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11303v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) have shown promise in modelling nonlinear dynamic systems with order uncertainty due to their advantages of easy implementation, less human intervention, and strong approximation capability. This paper develops the original RSCNs with block increments, termed block RSCNs (BRSCNs), to further enhance the learning capacity and efficiency of the network. BRSCNs can simultaneously add multiple reservoir nodes (subreservoirs) during the construction. Each subreservoir is configured with a unique structure in the light of a supervisory mechanism, ensuring the universal approximation property. The reservoir feedback matrix is appropriately scaled to guarantee the echo state property of the network. Furthermore, the output weights are updated online using a projection algorithm, and the persistent excitation conditions that facilitate parameter convergence are also established. Numerical results over a time series prediction, a nonlinear system identification task, and two industrial data predictive analyses demonstrate that the proposed BRSCN performs favourably in terms of modelling efficiency, learning, and generalization performance, highlighting their significant potential for coping with complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to understand how and why the integration of textual prompts into LLM can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of time series, which is not obvious at the glance, given the significant domain gap between texts and time series. Our extensive examination leads us to believe that (a) adding text prompts is roughly equivalent to introducing additional adapters, and (b) It is the introduction of learnable parameters rather than textual information that aligns the LLM with the time series forecasting task, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Inspired by this discovery, we developed four adapters that explicitly address the gap between LLM and time series, and further improve the prediction accuracy. Overall,our work highlights how textual prompts enhance LLM accuracy in time series forecasting and suggests new avenues for continually improving LLM-based time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

This work focuses on estimating the causal effect between two time series that are confounded by a third, unobserved time series. Assuming spectral sparsity of the confounder, we show how in the frequency domain this problem can be framed as an adversarial outlier problem. We introduce Deconfounding by Robust regression (DecoR), a novel approach that estimates the causal effect using robust linear regression in the frequency domain. Considering two different robust regression techniques, we first improve existing bounds on the estimation error for such techniques. Crucially, our results do not require distributional assumptions on the covariates. We can therefore use them in time series settings. Applying these results to DecoR, we prove, under suitable assumptions, upper bounds for the estimation error of DecoR that imply consistency. We demonstrate DecoR's effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world data from Earth system science. The simulation experiments furthermore suggest that DecoR is robust with respect to model misspecification.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |

Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of channel independence to resist distribution drift but neglect channel correlations, limiting further enhancements. Several methods utilize mechanisms like attention or mixer to address this by capturing channel correlations, but they either introduce excessive complexity or rely too heavily on the correlation to achieve satisfactory results under distribution drifts, particularly with a large number of channels. Addressing this gap, this paper presents an efficient MLP-based model, the Series-cOre Fused Time Series forecaster (SOFTS), which incorporates a novel STar Aggregate-Redistribute (STAR) module. Unlike traditional approaches that manage channel interactions through distributed structures, \textit{e.g.}, attention, STAR employs a centralized strategy to improve efficiency and reduce reliance on the quality of each channel. It aggregates all series to form a global core representation, which is then dispatched and fused with individual series representations to facilitate channel interactions effectively.SOFTS achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods with only linear complexity. The broad applicability of the STAR module across different forecasting models is also demonstrated empirically. For further research and development, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/Secilia-Cxy/SOFTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, efficiently serving LLM inference requests is challenging due to their unpredictable execution times originating from the autoregressive nature of generative models. Existing LLM serving systems exploit first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling, suffering from head-of-line blocking issues. To address the non-deterministic nature of LLMs and enable efficient interactive LLM serving, we present a speculative shortest-job-first (SSJF) scheduler that uses a light proxy model to predict LLM output sequence lengths. Our open-source SSJF implementation does not require changes to memory management or batching strategies. Evaluations on real-world datasets and production workload traces show that SSJF reduces average job completion times by 30.5-39.6% and increases throughput by 2.2-3.6x compared to FCFS schedulers, across no batching, dynamic batching, and continuous batching settings.</p></details> | Accepted at AIOps'24 |

However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and highlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable insights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

However, the effectiveness of mechanisms like self-reflection and self-correction depends on the model's capacity to accurately assess its own performance, which can be limited by factors such as initial accuracy, question difficulty, and the lack of external feedback. In this paper, we delve into a two-player paradigm that separates the roles of reasoning and critique models, where the critique model provides step-level feedback to supervise the reasoning (actor) model during both test-time and train-time. We first propose AutoMathCritique, an automated and scalable framework for collecting critique data, resulting in a dataset of $76,321$ responses paired with step-level feedback. Fine-tuning language models with this dataset enables them to generate natural language feedback for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate that the critique models consistently improve the actor's performance on difficult queries at test-time, especially when scaling up inference-time computation. Motivated by these findings, we introduce the critique-based supervision to the actor's self-training process, and propose a critique-in-the-loop self-improvement method. Experiments show that the method improves the actor's exploration efficiency and solution diversity, especially on challenging queries, leading to a stronger reasoning model. Lastly, we take the preliminary step to explore training self-talk reasoning models via critique supervision and showcase its potential.

To effectively communicate the risks and encourage mitigation efforts these models need adequate and intuitive descriptions of their discriminatory properties, appropriate for all audiences of AI. We suggest bias profiles with respect to stereotype dimensions based on dictionaries from social psychology research. Along these dimensions we investigate gender bias in contextual embeddings, across contexts and layers, and generate stereotype profiles for twelve different LLMs, demonstrating their intuition and use case for exposing and visualizing bias.</p></details> |  |

Previous work on the size and nature of this gap produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results. In this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop reasoning in LLMs, where the above-chance performance constitutes undeniable evidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B Instruct and GPT-4o) on fictional facts and confirm that they generalize to answering two-hop questions about them using CoT. We find that models can perform latent reasoning when facts appear together during training or in the prompt. However, to our surprise, models completely fail at two-hop reasoning without CoT when learned facts only appear in different documents, achieving chance-level accuracy and chance-level test loss. We call this complete failure to compose separately learned facts the Two-Hop Curse. Moreover, we evaluate 9 frontier LLMs on real-world facts, finding that models completely fail at two-hop no-CoT reasoning for over half of question categories while maintaining partial success with CoT across most categories. These results suggest that LLMs lack a general capability for latent multi-hop reasoning independent of the question type.</p></details> |  |

While existing solutions have improved automation, they frequently rely on unrealistic assumptions. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, UVLLM, which combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) to relax these assumptions. UVLLM significantly enhances the automation of testing and repairing error-prone Register Transfer Level (RTL) codes, a critical aspect of verification development. Unlike existing methods, UVLLM ensures that all errors are triggered during verification, achieving a syntax error fix rate of 86.99% and a functional error fix rate of 71.92% on our proposed benchmark. These results demonstrate a substantial improvement in verification efficiency. Additionally, our study highlights the current limitations of LLM applications, particularly their reliance on extensive training data. We emphasize the transformative potential of LLMs in hardware design verification and suggest promising directions for future research in AI-driven hardware design methodologies.

The main contributions include: 1) Introducing third-party LLMs to adjust the attention weights of agents through uncertainty estimation and confidence analysis, optimizing consensus formation in multi-agent systems; 2) Experiments on arithmetic datasets have validated the effectiveness of the method, surpassing traditional multi-agent baselines. This research provides a new perspective for large models to alleviate hallucination phenomena when dealing with complex tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing tool learning methods primarily rely on tuning with expert trajectories, focusing on token-sequence learning from a linguistic perspective. However, there are several challenges: 1) imitating static trajectories limits their ability to generalize to new tasks. 2) even expert trajectories can be suboptimal, and better solution paths may exist. In this work, we introduce StepTool, a novel step-grained reinforcement learning framework to improve tool learning in LLMs. It consists of two components: Step-grained Reward Shaping, which assigns rewards at each tool interaction based on tool invocation success and its contribution to the task, and Step-grained Optimization, which uses policy gradient methods to optimize the model in a multi-step manner. Experimental results demonstrate that StepTool significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-step, tool-based tasks, providing a robust solution for complex task environments.

Quantization has emerged as a promising solution, and state-of-the-art quantization algorithms for LLMs introduce the need for mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM), where lower-precision weights are multiplied with higher-precision activations. Despite its benefits, current hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs lack native support for efficient mpGEMM, leading to inefficient dequantization operations in the main sequential loop. To address this limitation, we introduce MixPE, a specialized mixed-precision processing element designed for efficient low-bit quantization in LLM inference. MixPE leverages two key innovations to minimize dequantization overhead and unlock the full potential of low-bit quantization. First, recognizing that scale and zero point are shared within each quantization group, we propose performing dequantization after per-group mpGEMM, significantly reducing dequantization overhead. Second, instead of relying on conventional multipliers, MixPE utilizes efficient shift\&add operations for multiplication, optimizing both computation and energy efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that MixPE surpasses the state-of-the-art quantization accelerators by $2.6\times$ speedup and $1.4\times$ energy reduction.</p></details> |  |

Following this advancement, researchers and companies have begun integrating LLMs across the hardware design and verification process. However, these highly potent LLMs can also induce new attack scenarios upon security vulnerabilities across the hardware development process. One such attack vector that has not been explored is intellectual property (IP) piracy. Given that this attack can manifest as rewriting hardware designs to evade piracy detection, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate LLM capabilities in performing this task and assess the mitigation abilities of current IP piracy detection tools. Therefore, in this work, we propose LLMPirate, the first LLM-based technique able to generate pirated variations of circuit designs that successfully evade detection across multiple state-of-the-art piracy detection tools. We devise three solutions to overcome challenges related to integration of LLMs for hardware circuit designs, scalability to large circuits, and effectiveness, resulting in an end-to-end automated, efficient, and practical formulation. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of LLMPirate using eight LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities and assess their performance in pirating various circuit designs against four state-of-the-art, widely-used piracy detection tools. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMPirate is able to consistently evade detection on 100% of tested circuits across every detection tool. Additionally, we showcase the ramifications of LLMPirate using case studies on IBEX and MOR1KX processors and a GPS module, that we successfully pirate. We envision that our work motivates and fosters the development of better IP piracy detection tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NDSS Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, the expansive scale of data and parameters of LLMs requires high-demand computational and memory resources, restricting their accessibility to a broader range of users and researchers. This paper introduces an effective approach that enhances the operational efficiency and affordability of LLM inference. By utilizing transformer-based federated learning (FL) with model-parallel distributed training, our model efficiently distributes the computational loads and memory requirements across a network of participants. This strategy permits users, especially those with limited resources to train state-of-the-art LLMs collaboratively. We also innovate an incentive mechanism within the FL framework, rewarding constructive contributions and filtering out malicious activities, thereby safeguarding the integrity and reliability of the training process. Concurrently, we leverage memory hierarchy strategies and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on weight matrices to boost computational and memory efficiencies further. Our results, derived from formulaic analyses and numerical calculations, demonstrate significant optimization of resource use and democratize access to cutting-edge LLMs, ensuring that a wide scale of users can both contribute to and benefit from these advanced models.</p></details> |  |

Existing fairness approaches do not account for variations in token lengths across applications and multiple LLM calls, making them unsuitable for such platforms. To address the fairness challenge, this paper analyzes millions of requests from thousands of users on MS CoPilot, a real-world multi-tenant LLM platform hosted by Microsoft. Our analysis confirms the inadequacy of existing methods and guides the development of FairServe, a system that ensures fair LLM access across diverse applications. FairServe proposes application-characteristic aware request throttling coupled with a weighted service counter based scheduling technique to curb abusive behavior and ensure fairness. Our experimental results on real-world traces demonstrate FairServe's superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method in ensuring fairness. We are actively working on deploying our system in production, expecting to benefit millions of customers world-wide.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks where data returned by external tools hijacks the agent to execute malicious tasks. To measure the adversarial robustness of AI agents, we introduce AgentDojo, an evaluation framework for agents that execute tools over untrusted data. To capture the evolving nature of attacks and defenses, AgentDojo is not a static test suite, but rather an extensible environment for designing and evaluating new agent tasks, defenses, and adaptive attacks. We populate the environment with 97 realistic tasks (e.g., managing an email client, navigating an e-banking website, or making travel bookings), 629 security test cases, and various attack and defense paradigms from the literature. We find that AgentDojo poses a challenge for both attacks and defenses: state-of-the-art LLMs fail at many tasks (even in the absence of attacks), and existing prompt injection attacks break some security properties but not all. We hope that AgentDojo can foster research on new design principles for AI agents that solve common tasks in a reliable and robust manner.. We release the code for AgentDojo at https://github.com/ethz-spylab/agentdojo.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version after fixing a bug in the Llama implementation and updating the travel suite</p></details> |

However, this shifts the energy and latency bottlenecks towards the FP activations that are associated with costly memory accesses and computations. Existing LLM accelerators focus primarily on computation optimizations, overlooking the potential of jointly optimizing FP computations and data movement, particularly for the dominant FP-INT GeMM operations in LLM inference. To address these challenges, we investigate the sensitivity of activation precision across various LLM modules and its impact on overall model accuracy. Based on our findings, we first propose the Anda data type: an adaptive data format with group-shared exponent bits and dynamic mantissa bit allocation. Secondly, we develop an iterative post-training adaptive precision search algorithm that optimizes the bit-width for different LLM modules to balance model accuracy, energy efficiency, and inference speed. Lastly, a suite of hardware optimization techniques is proposed to maximally exploit the benefits of the Anda format. These include a bit-plane-based data organization scheme, Anda-enhanced processing units with bit-serial computation, and a runtime bit-plane Anda compressor to simultaneously optimize storage, computation, and memory footprints. Our evaluations on FPINT GeMM operations show that Anda achieves a 2.4x speedup, 4.0x area efficiency, and 3.1x energy efficiency improvement on average for popular LLMs including OPT, LLaMA, and LLaMA-2 series over the GPU-like FP-FP baseline. Anda demonstrates strong adaptability across various application scenarios, accuracy requirements, and system performance, enabling efficient LLM inference across a wide range of deployment scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 2025 IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2025)</p></details> |

AGI, distinguished by its ability to execute diverse real-world tasks with efficiency and effectiveness comparable to human intelligence, reflects a paramount milestone in AI evolution. While existing studies have reviewed specific advancements in AI and proposed potential paths to AGI, such as large language models (LLMs), they fall short of providing a thorough exploration of AGI's definitions, objectives, and developmental trajectories. Unlike previous survey papers, this work goes beyond summarizing LLMs by addressing key questions about our progress toward AGI and outlining the strategies essential for its realization through comprehensive analysis, in-depth discussions, and novel insights. We start by articulating the requisite capability frameworks for AGI, integrating the internal, interface, and system dimensions. As the realization of AGI requires more advanced capabilities and adherence to stringent constraints, we further discuss necessary AGI alignment technologies to harmonize these factors. Notably, we emphasize the importance of approaching AGI responsibly by first defining the key levels of AGI progression, followed by the evaluation framework that situates the status quo, and finally giving our roadmap of how to reach the pinnacle of AGI. Moreover, to give tangible insights into the ubiquitous impact of the integration of AI, we outline existing challenges and potential pathways toward AGI in multiple domains. In sum, serving as a pioneering exploration into the current state and future trajectory of AGI, this paper aims to foster a collective comprehension and catalyze broader public discussions among researchers and practitioners on AGI.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant strides toward safety alignment, recent work GCG~\citep{zou2023universal} proposes a discrete token optimization algorithm and selects the single suffix with the lowest loss to successfully jailbreak aligned LLMs. In this work, we first discuss the drawbacks of solely picking the suffix with the lowest loss during GCG optimization for jailbreaking and uncover the missed successful suffixes during the intermediate steps. Moreover, we utilize those successful suffixes as training data to learn a generative model, named AmpleGCG, which captures the distribution of adversarial suffixes given a harmful query and enables the rapid generation of hundreds of suffixes for any harmful queries in seconds. AmpleGCG achieves near 100\% attack success rate (ASR) on two aligned LLMs (Llama-2-7B-chat and Vicuna-7B), surpassing two strongest attack baselines. More interestingly, AmpleGCG also transfers seamlessly to attack different models, including closed-source LLMs, achieving a 99\% ASR on the latest GPT-3.5. To summarize, our work amplifies the impact of GCG by training a generative model of adversarial suffixes that is universal to any harmful queries and transferable from attacking open-source LLMs to closed-source LLMs. In addition, it can generate 200 adversarial suffixes for one harmful query in only 4 seconds, rendering it more challenging to defend.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2024 (https://colmweb.org/index.html)</p></details> |

Symboleo is a promising language in that area. However, writing formal specifications from natural-language contracts is a complex task, especial for legal experts who do not have formal language expertise. This paper reports on an exploratory experiment targeting the automated generation of Symboleo specifications from business contracts in English using Large Language Models (LLMs). Combinations (38) of prompt components are investigated (with/without the grammar, semantics explanations, 0 to 3 examples, and emotional prompts), mainly on GPT-4o but also to a lesser extent on 4 other LLMs. The generated specifications are manually assessed against 16 error types grouped into 3 severity levels. Early results on all LLMs show promising outcomes (even for a little-known DSL) that will likely accelerate the specification of legal contracts. However, several observed issues, especially around grammar/syntax adherence and environment variable identification (49%), suggest many areas where potential improvements should be investigated.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables, submitted to a workshop</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a targeted method that incorporates the clinical domain knowledge into LLMs to improve their ability to detect anomalies. We introduce the Metabolism Pathway-driven Prompting (MPP) method, which integrates the information about metabolic pathways to better capture the structural and temporal changes in biological samples. We applied our method for doping detection in sports, focusing on steroid metabolism, and evaluated using real-world data from athletes. The results show that our method improves anomaly detection performance by leveraging metabolic context, providing a more nuanced and accurate prediction of suspicious samples in athletes' profiles.</p></details> |  |

Highly optimized frameworks, however, still suffer significant losses in Model FLOPS utilization (often below 50%) due to large communication volumes. Meanwhile, our comprehensive profiling shows that the computation- and communication-intensive operators overlap well. This paper introduces DHelix, a novel micro-structure that dramatically improves the efficiency of LLM training inspired by the DNA structure. Central to DHelix's design is Strand Interleaving (SI), which views the continuous stream of training micro-batches through a GPU as two strands. DHelix juxtaposes the forward and backward passes of the two strands and performs a systematic optimization for an SI plan that co-schedules the operators from the opposite strands, enabled by operator-level overlap profiling results and a dynamic-programming based search algorithm. Meanwhile, DHelix enables the two strands to share model states and space for activation data, effectively accommodating two micro-batches with under 3% extra memory space. Dhelix seamlessly integrates with all forms of existing data/model parallelism, the most challenging being pipeline parallelism, thanks to its unique model folding design that results in a W-shaped pipeline. We evaluate DHelix training with the popular Llama and GPT dense models, plus the Phi Mixture of Expert (MoE) model, across 3 GPU clusters (A40, A800, and H100). Results show that it achieves 12-40% (up to 58% MFU) and 2-29% (up to 71% MFU) improvement on the 64-A40 and 64-A800 clusters, respectively, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. On the H100 cluster, though the faster network reduces DHelix's profit margin, it makes cross-node tensor parallelism promising, a practice currently prohibitive due to communication costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Do Not Think Step-by-step In Implicit Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15862v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been well-known that Chain-of-Thought can remarkably enhance LLMs' performance on complex tasks. However, because it also introduces slower inference speeds and higher computational costs, many researches have attempted to use implicit CoT, which does not need LLMs to explicitly generate the intermediate steps. But there is still gap between their efficacy and typical explicit CoT methods. This leaves us a doubt that, does implicit CoT really equal to explicit CoT? Therefore, in this study, we address this question through experiments. We probe the information of intermediate steps from the model's hidden states when it is performing implicit CoT. The results surprisingly indicate that LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning. Moreover, we find LLMs' implicit reasoning capabilities are susceptible and unstable, reaffirming the necessity of explicit CoT to effectively support complex tasks.</p></details> |  |

The LLM-OSR utilizes a GSP-based spatial-temporal signal handler to enhance graph signals and employs LLMs to predict missing values based on spatiotemporal patterns. The performance of LLM-OSR is evaluated on traffic and meteorological datasets under varying Gaussian noise levels. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing GPT-4-o mini within the LLM-OSR is accurate and robust under Gaussian noise conditions. The limitations are discussed along with future research insights, emphasizing the potential of combining GSP techniques with LLMs for solving spatiotemporal prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

These capabilities are further augmented during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase. Despite their potential, existing work mainly focuses on domain-specific enhancements during fine-tuning, the challenge of which lies in catastrophic forgetting of knowledge across other domains. In this study, we introduce VersaTune, a novel data composition framework designed for enhancing LLMs' overall multi-ability performances during fine-tuning. We categorize knowledge into distinct domains including law, medicine, finance, science, code. We begin with detecting the distribution of domain-specific knowledge within the base model, followed by the composition of training data that aligns with the model's existing knowledge distribution. During the fine-tuning process, weights of different domains are dynamically adjusted based on their learnable potential and forgetting degree. Experimental results demonstrate that VersaTune achieves significant improvements in multi-domain performance, with a 35.21% enhancement in comprehensive multi-domain tasks. Additionally, in scenarios where specific domain optimization is required, VersaTune reduces the degradation of performance in other domains by 38.77%, without compromising the target domain's training efficacy.</p></details> |  |

However, the absence of benchmarks designed to evaluate these speech interaction capabilities has hindered progress of LLM-based voice assistants development. Current evaluations focus primarily on automatic speech recognition (ASR) or general knowledge evaluation with clean speeches, neglecting the more intricate, real-world scenarios that involve diverse speaker characteristics, environmental and content factors. To address this, we introduce VoiceBench, the first benchmark designed to provide a multi-faceted evaluation of LLM-based voice assistants.

Despite their potential, several critical challenges remain unsolved, particularly in translating theoretical ideas into practical applications within the highly specialized field of pharmaceutical research, limiting practitioners from leveraging the latest AI development in drug discovery. To this end, we introduce DrugAgent, a multi-agent framework aimed at automating machine learning (ML) programming in drug discovery. DrugAgent incorporates domain expertise by identifying specific requirements and building domain-specific tools, while systematically exploring different ideas to find effective solutions. A preliminary case study demonstrates DrugAgent's potential to overcome key limitations LLMs face in drug discovery, moving toward AI-driven innovation. For example, DrugAgent is able to complete the ML programming pipeline end-to-end, from data acquisition to performance evaluation for the ADMET prediction task, and finally select the best model, where the random forest model achieves an F1 score of 0.92 when predicting absorption using the PAMPA dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Learn by Teaching for Better Reasoning? A Preliminary Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14629v3)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching to improve student models (e.g., knowledge distillation) is an extensively studied methodology in LLMs. However, for humans, teaching improves not only students but also teachers, by fostering more rigorous and clear reasoning as well as knowledge building. We ask: Can LLMs also learn by teaching (LbT) for better reasoning? If the answer is yes, we can potentially unlock the possibility of continuously advancing the models without solely relying on human-produced data or stronger models. In this paper, we provide a preliminary exploration on this question. We show that LbT ideas can be incorporated into existing LLM training/prompting pipelines and bring improvements. Specifically, we design three methods, each mimicking one of the three levels of LbT: observing students' feedback, learning from the feedback, and learning iteratively, with the goals of improving answer accuracy without training or improving models' inherent capability with fine-tuning. We reveal some findings: (1) Teaching materials that make it easier for students to learn have clearer and more accurate logic when using in-context learning as the student's "learning" method; (2) Weak-to-strong generalization: LbT might help improve strong models by teaching weak models; (3) Diversity in students might help: teaching multiple students could be better than teaching one student or the teacher itself. We hope that our exploration can inspire future research on LbT and more broadly adopting the advanced techniques in education to improve LLMs. The code and website are at https://github.com/imagination-research/lbt and https://sites.google.com/view/llm-learning-by-teaching.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, the research community lacks clarity about whether and to what extent these instruments meet the needs of practitioners tasked with developing and deploying LLM-based systems in the real world, and how these instruments could be improved. Via a series of semi-structured interviews with practitioners in a variety of roles in different organizations, we identify four types of challenges that prevent practitioners from effectively using publicly available instruments for measuring representational harms caused by LLM-based systems: (1) challenges related to using publicly available measurement instruments; (2) challenges related to doing measurement in practice; (3) challenges arising from measurement tasks involving LLM-based systems; and (4) challenges specific to measuring representational harms. Our goal is to advance the development of instruments for measuring representational harms that are well-suited to practitioner needs, thus better facilitating the responsible development and deployment of LLM-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Evaluating Evaluations (EvalEval)</p></details> |

For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose Squeezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of the keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded during inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important keys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to identify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement optimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively evaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and up to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.</p></details> |  |

Distributed training, particularly through Sharded Data Parallelism (ShardedDP) which partitions optimizer states among workers, has emerged as a crucial technique to mitigate training time and memory usage. Yet, a major challenge in the scalability of ShardedDP is the intensive communication of weights and gradients. While compression techniques can alleviate this issue, they often result in worse accuracy. Driven by this limitation, we propose SDP4Bit (Toward 4Bit Communication Quantization in Sharded Data Parallelism for LLM Training), which effectively reduces the communication of weights and gradients to nearly 4 bits via two novel techniques: quantization on weight differences, and two-level gradient smooth quantization. Furthermore, SDP4Bit presents an algorithm-system co-design with runtime optimization to minimize the computation overhead of compression. In addition to the theoretical guarantees of convergence, we empirically evaluate the accuracy of SDP4Bit on the pre-training of GPT models with up to 6.7 billion parameters, and the results demonstrate a negligible impact on training loss. Furthermore, speed experiments show that SDP4Bit achieves up to 4.08$\times$ speedup in end-to-end throughput on a scale of 128 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Aligning LLM Agents by Learning Latent Preference from User Edits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15269v3)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study interactive learning of LLM-based language agents based on user edits made to the agent's output. In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness. The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time. We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data. The inferred user preference descriptions are used to define prompts for generating responses in the future. This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks. Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference. However, user preference can be complex, subtle, and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages the LLM to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits. In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation. We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, and use a GPT-4 simulated user for evaluation. On both tasks, CIPHER outperforms several baselines by achieving the lowest edit distance cost while only having a small overhead in LLM query cost. Our analysis reports that user preferences learned by CIPHER show significant similarity to the ground truth latent preferences.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 9 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.05470 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Study on Challenges for LLM Application Developers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05002v3)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancements, significantly impacting various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and software engineering. These LLMs, exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, have revolutionized the way we approach language understanding and generation tasks. However, in contrast to traditional software development practices, LLM development introduces new challenges for AI developers in design, implementation, and deployment. These challenges span different areas (such as prompts, APIs, and plugins), requiring developers to navigate unique methodologies and considerations specific to LLM application development. Despite the profound influence of LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, these challenges have not been thoroughly investigated in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study on understanding the challenges faced by LLM developers. Specifically, we crawl and analyze 29,057 relevant questions from a popular OpenAI developer forum. We first examine their popularity and difficulty. After manually analyzing 2,364 sampled questions, we construct a taxonomy of challenges faced by LLM developers. Based on this taxonomy, we summarize a set of findings and actionable implications for LLM-related stakeholders, including developers and providers (especially the OpenAI organization).</p></details> | 35 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Do LLMs Agree on the Creativity Evaluation of Alternative Uses?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15560v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) show agreement in assessing creativity in responses to the Alternative Uses Test (AUT). While LLMs are increasingly used to evaluate creative content, previous studies have primarily focused on a single model assessing responses generated by the same model or humans. This paper explores whether LLMs can impartially and accurately evaluate creativity in outputs generated by both themselves and other models. Using an oracle benchmark set of AUT responses, categorized by creativity level (common, creative, and highly creative), we experiment with four state-of-the-art LLMs evaluating these outputs. We test both scoring and ranking methods and employ two evaluation settings (comprehensive and segmented) to examine if LLMs agree on the creativity evaluation of alternative uses. Results reveal high inter-model agreement, with Spearman correlations averaging above 0.7 across models and reaching over 0.77 with respect to the oracle, indicating a high level of agreement and validating the reliability of LLMs in creativity assessment of alternative uses. Notably, models do not favour their own responses, instead they provide similar creativity assessment scores or rankings for alternative uses generated by other models. These findings suggest that LLMs exhibit impartiality and high alignment in creativity evaluation, offering promising implications for their use in automated creativity assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reassessing Layer Pruning in LLMs: New Insights and Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15558v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, their considerable scale necessitates substantial computational resources, posing significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Layer pruning, as a simple yet effective compression method, removes layers of a model directly, reducing computational overhead. However, what are the best practices for layer pruning in LLMs? Are sophisticated layer selection metrics truly effective? Does the LoRA (Low-Rank Approximation) family, widely regarded as a leading method for pruned model fine-tuning, truly meet expectations when applied to post-pruning fine-tuning? To answer these questions, we dedicate thousands of GPU hours to benchmarking layer pruning in LLMs and gaining insights across multiple dimensions. Our results demonstrate that a simple approach, i.e., pruning the final 25\% of layers followed by fine-tuning the \texttt{lm\_head} and the remaining last three layer, yields remarkably strong performance. Following this guide, we prune Llama-3.1-8B-It and obtain a model that outperforms many popular LLMs of similar size, such as ChatGLM2-6B, Vicuna-7B-v1.5, Qwen1.5-7B and Baichuan2-7B. We release the optimal model weights on Huggingface, and the code is available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Exploring and Eliciting LLMs' Capability in Code Snippet Adaptation Through Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15501v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code snippet adaptation is a fundamental activity in the software development process. Unlike code generation, code snippet adaptation is not a "free creation", which requires developers to tailor a given code snippet in order to fit specific requirements and the code context. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have confirmed their effectiveness in the code generation task with promising results. However, their performance on adaptation, a reuse-oriented and context-dependent code change prediction task, is still unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance and issues of LLMs on the adaptation task. We first evaluate the adaptation performances of three popular LLMs and compare them to the code generation task. Our result indicates that their adaptation ability is weaker than generation, with a nearly 15% decrease on pass@1 and more context-related errors. By manually inspecting 200 cases, we further investigate the causes of LLMs' sub-optimal performance, which can be classified into three categories, i.e., Unclear Requirement, Requirement Misalignment and Context Misapplication. Based on the above empirical research, we propose an interactive prompting approach to eliciting LLMs' adaptation ability. Experimental result reveals that our approach greatly improve LLMs' adaptation performance. The best-performing Human-LLM interaction successfully solves 159 out of the 202 identified defects and improves the pass@1 and pass@5 by over 40% compared to the initial instruction-based prompt. Considering human efforts, we suggest multi-agent interaction as a trade-off, which can achieve comparable performance with excellent generalization ability. We deem that our approach could provide methodological assistance for autonomous code snippet reuse and adaptation with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, accepted by ICSE 2025</p></details> |

We identify three key properties that contribute to the effectiveness of instruction-tuning datasets: fluency, diversity, and cultural context. We propose a seed-data-free framework for generating synthetic instruction-tuning data that incorporates these essential properties. Our framework employs an LLM to generate diverse topics, retrieve relevant contexts from Wikipedia, and create instructions for various tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and conversation. The experimental results show that our best-performing synthetic dataset, which incorporates all three key properties, achieves competitive performance using only 5,000 instructions when compared to state-of-the-art Thai LLMs trained on hundreds of thousands of instructions.

LLMs have been trained on a vast corpus of texts from various sources; despite the best efforts during the data pre-processing stage while training the LLMs, they may pick some undesirable information such as personally identifiable information (PII). Consequently, in recent times research in the area of Machine Unlearning (MUL) has become active, the main idea is to force LLMs to forget (unlearn) certain information (e.g., PII) without suffering from performance loss on regular tasks. In this work, we examine the robustness of the existing MUL techniques for their ability to enable leakage-proof forgetting in LLMs. In particular, we examine the effect of data transformation on forgetting, i.e., is an unlearned LLM able to recall forgotten information if there is a change in the format of the input? Our findings on the TOFU dataset highlight the necessity of using diverse data formats to quantify unlearning in LLMs more reliably.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Findings; 21 pages (5 page main content + references + appendix)</p></details> |

Among the existing solutions, knowledge distillation stands out due to its outstanding efficiency and generalization. However, existing methods suffer from several drawbacks, including limited knowledge diversity and the lack of rich contextual information. To solve the problems and facilitate the learning of compact language models, we propose TinyLLM, a new knowledge distillation paradigm to learn a small student LLM from multiple large teacher LLMs. In particular, we encourage the student LLM to not only generate the correct answers but also understand the rationales behind these answers. Given that different LLMs possess diverse reasoning skills, we guide the student model to assimilate knowledge from various teacher LLMs. We further introduce an in-context example generator and a teacher-forcing Chain-of-Thought strategy to ensure that the rationales are accurate and grounded in contextually appropriate scenarios. Extensive experiments on six datasets across two reasoning tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. Results show that TinyLLM can outperform large teacher LLMs significantly, despite a considerably smaller model size.

However, writing SVA is a laborious task and has a steep learning curve. In this work, we present a large language model (LLM) -based flow to automatically generate high-quality SVA from the design specification documents, named \ToolName. We introduce a novel sub-task-focused fine-tuning approach that effectively addresses functionally incorrect assertions produced by baseline LLMs, leading to a remarkable 7.3-fold increase in the number of functionally correct assertions. Recognizing the prevalence of syntax and semantic errors, we also developed an iterative refinement method that enhances the LLM's initial outputs by systematically re-prompting it to correct identified issues. This process is further strengthened by a custom compiler that generates meaningful error messages, guiding the LLM towards improved accuracy. The experiments demonstrate a 26\% increase in the number of assertions free from syntax errors using this approach, showcasing its potential to streamline the FPV process.</p></details> |  |

However, managing large amounts of data and interacting with numerous APIs makes function calling hardware-intensive and costly, especially on edge devices. Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with function calling at the edge because they cannot handle complex inputs or manage multiple tools effectively. This results in low task-completion accuracy, increased delays, and higher power consumption. In this work, we introduce Less-is-More, a novel fine-tuning-free function-calling scheme for dynamic tool selection. Our approach is based on the key insight that selectively reducing the number of tools available to LLMs significantly improves their function-calling performance, execution time, and power efficiency on edge devices. Experimental results with state-of-the-art LLMs on edge hardware show agentic success rate improvements, with execution time reduced by up to 70% and power consumption by up to 40%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DATE 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Decoy Dilemma in Online Medical Information Evaluation: A Comparative Study of Credibility Assessments by LLM and Human Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15396v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can AI be cognitively biased in automated information judgment tasks? Despite recent progresses in measuring and mitigating social and algorithmic biases in AI and large language models (LLMs), it is not clear to what extent LLMs behave "rationally", or if they are also vulnerable to human cognitive bias triggers. To address this open problem, our study, consisting of a crowdsourcing user experiment and a LLM-enabled simulation experiment, compared the credibility assessments by LLM and human judges under potential decoy effects in an information retrieval (IR) setting, and empirically examined the extent to which LLMs are cognitively biased in COVID-19 medical (mis)information assessment tasks compared to traditional human assessors as a baseline. The results, collected from a between-subject user experiment and a LLM-enabled replicate experiment, demonstrate that 1) Larger and more recent LLMs tend to show a higher level of consistency and accuracy in distinguishing credible information from misinformation. However, they are more likely to give higher ratings for misinformation due to the presence of a more salient, decoy misinformation result; 2) While decoy effect occurred in both human and LLM assessments, the effect is more prevalent across different conditions and topics in LLM judgments compared to human credibility ratings. In contrast to the generally assumed "rationality" of AI tools, our study empirically confirms the cognitive bias risks embedded in LLM agents, evaluates the decoy impact on LLMs against human credibility assessments, and thereby highlights the complexity and importance of debiasing AI agents and developing psychology-informed AI audit techniques and policies for automated judgment tasks and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond correlation: The impact of human uncertainty in measuring the effectiveness of automatic evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03775v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of automatic evaluation of generative models is typically measured by comparing it to human evaluation using correlation metrics. However, metrics like Krippendorff's $\alpha$ and Randolph's $\kappa$, originally designed to measure the reliability of human labeling, make assumptions about human behavior and the labeling process. In this paper, we show how *relying on a single aggregate correlation score* can obscure fundamental differences between human behavior and automatic evaluation methods, including LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the proportion of samples with variation or uncertainty in human labels (gathered during human evaluation) is relatively high, machine labels (generated by automatic evaluation methods) may superficially appear to have similar or better correlation with the human majority label compared to human-to-human (HH) correlation. This can create the illusion that automatic evaluation approximates the human majority label. However, as the proportion of samples with consistent human labels increases, the correlation between machine and human labels fall well below HH correlation. Based on these findings, we first propose stratifying results by human label uncertainty to provide a more robust analysis of automatic evaluation performance. Second, recognizing that uncertainty and variation are inherent in perception-based human evaluations, such as those involving attitudes or preferences, we introduce a new metric - *binned Jensen-Shannon Divergence for perception* for such scenarios to better measure the effectiveness of automatic evaluations. Third, we present visualization techniques -- *perception charts*, to compare the strengths and limitations of automatic evaluation and to contextualize correlation measures appropriately</p></details> |  |

This work accompanies the first-ever release of a LLM-generated, MBR-decoded and QE-reranked dataset with both sentence-level and multi-sentence examples. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the quality of our dataset in terms of its downstream impact on NMT model performance. We find that training from scratch on our (machine-generated) dataset outperforms training on the (web-crawled) WMT'23 training dataset (which is 300 times larger), and also outperforms training on the top-quality subset of the WMT'23 training dataset. We also find that performing self-distillation by finetuning the LLM which generated this dataset outperforms the LLM's strong few-shot baseline. These findings corroborate the quality of our dataset, and demonstrate the value of high-quality machine-generated data in improving performance of NMT models.</p></details> |  |

Recently, it has been shown that LLMs are themselves state-of-the-art evaluators for many tasks. These Autoraters are typically designed so that they generalize to new systems and test sets. In practice, however, evaluation is performed on a small set of fixed, canonical test sets, which are carefully curated to measure certain capabilities of interest and are not changed frequently. In this work, we design a method which specializes a prompted Autorater to a given test set, by leveraging historical ratings on the test set to construct in-context learning (ICL) examples. We evaluate our Specialist method on the task of fine-grained machine translation evaluation, and show that it dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art XCOMET metric by 54% and 119% on the WMT'23 and WMT'24 test sets, respectively. We perform extensive analyses to understand the representations learned by our Specialist metrics, and how variability in rater behavior affects their performance. We also verify the generalizability and robustness of our Specialist method for designing automatic metrics across different numbers of ICL examples, LLM backbones, systems to evaluate, and evaluation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Concurrently, regulatory bodies must effectively monitor manufacturers' responses and develop strategic surveillance plans. This study employs a multi-agent modeling approach, enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), to simulate regulatory dynamics and examine the adaptive behaviors of key actors, including regulatory bodies, manufacturers, and competitors. These agents operate within a simulated environment governed by regulatory flow theory, capturing the impacts of regulatory changes on compliance decisions, market adaptation, and innovation strategies. Our findings illuminate the influence of regulatory shifts on industry behaviour and identify strategic opportunities for improving regulatory practices, optimizing compliance, and fostering innovation. By leveraging the integration of multi-agent systems and LLMs, this research provides a novel perspective and offers actionable insights for stakeholders navigating the evolving regulatory landscape of the medical device industry.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks are often simplistic, allowing models to perform uniformly well and making it difficult to distinguish their capabilities. Additionally, benchmarks typically rely on static question-answer pairs that the models might memorize or guess. To address these limitations, we introduce Dynamic Intelligence Assessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic question templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as mathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The accompanying dataset, DIA-Bench, contains a diverse collection of challenge templates with mutable parameters presented in various formats, including text, PDFs, compiled binaries, visual puzzles, and CTF-style cybersecurity challenges. Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's reliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed that even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in varying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably, API models like GPT-4o often overestimated their mathematical capabilities, while ChatGPT-4o demonstrated better performance due to effective tool usage. In self-assessment, OpenAI's o1-mini proved to have the best judgement on what tasks it should attempt to solve. We evaluated 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using DIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often display unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions. The DIA framework sets a new standard for assessing not only problem-solving but also a model's adaptive intelligence and ability to assess its limitations. The dataset is publicly available on the project's page: https://github.com/DIA-Bench.</p></details> |  |

Building upon pre-trained LLMs, this family of models further develops multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities that are impressive, such as writing code given a flow chart or creating stories based on an image. In the development process, evaluation is critical since it provides intuitive feedback and guidance on improving models. Distinct from the traditional train-eval-test paradigm that only favors a single task like image classification, the versatility of MLLMs has spurred the rise of various new benchmarks and evaluation methods. In this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive survey of MLLM evaluation, discussing four key aspects: 1) the summarised benchmarks types divided by the evaluation capabilities, including foundation capabilities, model self-analysis, and extented applications; 2) the typical process of benchmark counstruction, consisting of data collection, annotation, and precautions; 3) the systematic evaluation manner composed of judge, metric, and toolkit; 4) the outlook for the next benchmark.

While many studies have discussed governance and regulations deductively from first-order principles, few studies provide an inductive, data-driven lens based on observing dialogues between humans and LLMs especially when it comes to non-collaborative, competitive situations that have the potential to pose a serious threat to people. In this work, we conduct a user study engaging over 40 individuals across all age groups in price negotiations with an LLM. We explore how people interact with an LLM, investigating differences in negotiation outcomes and strategies. Furthermore, we highlight shortcomings of LLMs with respect to their reasoning capabilities and, in turn, susceptiveness to prompt hacking, which intends to manipulate the LLM to make agreements that are against its instructions or beyond any rationality. We also show that the negotiated prices humans manage to achieve span a broad range, which points to a literacy gap in effectively interacting with LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we examine LLM alignment with human annotations in five offensive language datasets, comprising approximately 220K annotations. Our findings reveal that while demographic traits, particularly race, influence alignment, these effects are inconsistent across datasets and often entangled with other factors. Confounders -- such as document difficulty, annotator sensitivity, and within-group agreement -- account for more variation in alignment patterns than demographic traits alone. Specifically, alignment increases with higher annotator sensitivity and group agreement, while greater document difficulty corresponds to reduced alignment. Our results underscore the importance of multi-dataset analyses and confounder-aware methodologies in developing robust measures of demographic bias in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

As a result, interactions with robots must be simple and intuitive, with robots perception adapting efficiently to human-induced changes. This paper presents a robot control architecture that addresses key challenges in human-robot interaction, with a particular focus on the dynamic creation and continuous update of the robot state representation. The architecture uses Large Language Models to integrate diverse information sources, including natural language commands, robotic skills representation, real-time dynamic semantic mapping of the perceived scene. This enables flexible and adaptive robotic behavior in complex, dynamic environments. Traditional robotic systems often rely on static, pre-programmed instructions and settings, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments and real-time collaboration. In contrast, this architecture uses LLMs to interpret complex, high-level instructions and generate actionable plans that enhance human-robot collaboration. At its core, the system Perception Module generates and continuously updates a semantic scene graph using RGB-D sensor data, providing a detailed and structured representation of the environment. A particle filter is employed to ensure accurate object localization in dynamic, real-world settings. The Planner Module leverages this up-to-date semantic map to break down high-level tasks into sub-tasks and link them to robotic skills such as navigation, object manipulation (e.g., PICK and PLACE), and movement (e.g., GOTO). By combining real-time perception, state tracking, and LLM-driven communication and task planning, the architecture enhances adaptability, task efficiency, and human-robot collaboration in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches to generate 3D geometry most commonly use meshes as a 3D representation. While meshes are suitable for assets in video games or animations, they lack sufficient precision and adaptability for mechanical engineering purposes. This paper introduces a novel approach for the generation of 3D geometry that generates surface-based Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) by leveraging a code-generation LLM. First, we create a dataset of 3D mechanical parts represented as code scripts by converting Boundary Representation geometry (BREP) into CSG-based Python scripts. Second, we create annotations in natural language using GPT-4. The resulting dataset is used to fine-tune a code-generation LLM. The fine-tuned LLM can complete geometries based on positional input and natural language in a plausible way, demonstrating geometric understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, as LLMs grow in size, the memory demands for backpropagation become increasingly prohibitive. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods offer a memory-efficient alternative by using forward passes to estimate gradients, but the variance of gradient estimates typically scales linearly with the model's parameter dimension$\unicode{x2013}$a significant issue for LLMs. In this paper, we propose the random Subspace Zeroth-order (SubZero) optimization to address the challenges posed by LLMs' high dimensionality. We introduce a low-rank perturbation tailored for LLMs that significantly reduces memory consumption while improving training performance. Additionally, we prove that our gradient estimation closely approximates the backpropagation gradient, exhibits lower variance than traditional ZO methods, and ensures convergence when combined with SGD. Experimental results show that SubZero enhances fine-tuning performance and achieves faster convergence compared to standard ZO approaches like MeZO across various language modeling tasks.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs offer promise for modernizing these systems, their ability to understand legacy languages is largely unknown. This paper investigates the utilization of LLMs to generate documentation for legacy code using two datasets: an electronic health records (EHR) system in MUMPS and open-source applications in IBM mainframe Assembly Language Code (ALC). We propose a prompting strategy for generating line-wise code comments and a rubric to evaluate their completeness, readability, usefulness, and hallucination. Our study assesses the correlation between human evaluations and automated metrics, such as code complexity and reference-based metrics. We find that LLM-generated comments for MUMPS and ALC are generally hallucination-free, complete, readable, and useful compared to ground-truth comments, though ALC poses challenges. However, no automated metrics strongly correlate with comment quality to predict or measure LLM performance. Our findings highlight the limitations of current automated measures and the need for better evaluation metrics for LLM-generated documentation in legacy systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abbre...</summary><p>Abbreviated version submitted to LLM4Code 2025 (a workshop co-located with ICSE 2025), 13 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

However, building robust detection models is challenging due to the lack of diverse, realistic datasets an issue often tied to privacy concerns and the wide variety of document formats. Traditional tools like Faker rely on predefined templates, making them less effective for capturing the complexity of real-world identity documents. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to synthetic data generation that uses LLMs to create contextually rich and realistic data without relying on predefined field. Using the vast knowledge LLMs have about different documents and content, our method creates data that reflects the variety found in real identity documents. This data is then encoded into barcode and overlayed on templates for documents such as Driver's licenses, Insurance cards, Student IDs. Our approach simplifies the process of dataset creation, eliminating the need for extensive domain knowledge or predefined fields. Compared to traditional methods like Faker, data generated by LLM demonstrates greater diversity and contextual relevance, leading to improved performance in barcode detection models. This scalable, privacy-first solution is a big step forward in advancing machine learning for automated document processing and identity verification.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figures |

Static malware analysis is one of the most important tasks in cybersecurity; however, it is time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. Therefore, we conducted a demonstration experiment focusing on whether an LLM can be used to support static analysis. First, we evaluated the ability of the LLM to explain malware functionality. The results showed that the LLM can generate descriptions that cover functions with an accuracy of up to 90.9\%. In addition, we asked six static analysts to perform a pseudo static analysis task using LLM explanations to verify that the LLM can be used in practice. Through subsequent questionnaires and interviews with the participants, we also demonstrated the practical applicability of LLMs. Lastly, we summarized the problems and required functions when using an LLM as static analysis support, as well as recommendations for future research opportunities.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have demonstrated that instruction-based LLMs can be effectively utilized for data augmentation to generate diverse and realistic text samples. This study applied prompt-based data augmentation to detect mentions of green practices in Russian social media. Detecting green practices in social media aids in understanding their prevalence and helps formulate recommendations for scaling eco-friendly actions to mitigate environmental issues. We evaluated several prompts for augmenting texts in a multi-label classification task, either by rewriting existing datasets using LLMs, generating new data, or combining both approaches. Our results revealed that all strategies improved classification performance compared to the models fine-tuned only on the original dataset, outperforming baselines in most cases. The best results were obtained with the prompt that paraphrased the original text while clearly indicating the relevant categories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ivann...</summary><p>Ivannikov ISPRAS Open Conference (ISPRAS) 2024</p></details> |

When integrated into social robots, LLMs offer the potential for more natural interactions. However, while LLMs promise numerous benefits, they also raise critical ethical concerns, particularly around the issue of hallucinations and deceptive patterns. In this case study, we observed a critical pattern of deceptive behavior in commercially available LLM-based care software integrated into robots. The LLM-equipped robot falsely claimed to have medication reminder functionalities. Not only did these systems assure users of their ability to manage medication schedules, but they also proactively suggested this capability, despite lacking it. This deceptive behavior poses significant risks in healthcare environments, where reliability is paramount. Our findings highlights the ethical and safety concerns surrounding the deployment of LLM-integrated robots in healthcare, emphasizing the need for oversight to prevent potentially harmful consequences for vulnerable populations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1table, 1 figure</p></details> |

While traditional methods depend on the inherent knowledge of LLMs without fine-tuning, more recent approaches have shifted toward the reinforcement learning strategy to further enhance agents' ability to solve complex interactive tasks with environments and tools. However, previous approaches are constrained by the sparse reward issue, where existing datasets solely provide a final scalar reward for each multi-step reasoning chain, potentially leading to ineffectiveness and inefficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we introduce StepAgent, which utilizes step-wise reward to optimize the agent's reinforcement learning process. Inheriting the spirit of novice-to-expert theory, we first compare the actions of the expert and the agent to automatically generate intermediate rewards for fine-grained optimization. Additionally, we propose implicit-reward and inverse reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate agent reflection and policy adjustment. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates that the action distribution of the agent can converge toward the expert action distribution over multiple training cycles. Experimental results across various datasets indicate that StepAgent outperforms existing baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful code analysis capabilities, but their static training data and privacy risks limit their effectiveness. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we propose LSAST, a novel approach that integrates LLMs with SAST scanners to enhance vulnerability detection. LSAST leverages a locally hostable LLM, combined with a state-of-the-art knowledge retrieval system, to provide up-to-date vulnerability insights without compromising data privacy. We set a new benchmark for static vulnerability analysis, offering a robust, privacy-conscious solution that bridges the gap between traditional scanners and advanced AI-driven analysis. Our evaluation demonstrates that incorporating SAST results into LLM analysis significantly improves detection accuracy, identifying vulnerabilities missed by conventional methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review of IEEE SaTML 2024</p></details> |

Previous approaches have labeled rationales that produce correct answers for a given question as appropriate for training. However, a single measure risks misjudging rationale quality, leading the models to learn flawed reasoning patterns. To address this issue, we propose CREST (Consistency-driven Rationale Evaluation for Self-Training), a self-training framework that further evaluates each rationale through follow-up questions and leverages this evaluation to guide its training. Specifically, we introduce two methods: (1) filtering out rationales that frequently result in incorrect answers on follow-up questions and (2) preference learning based on mixed preferences from rationale evaluation results of both original and follow-up questions. Experiments on three question-answering datasets using open LLMs show that CREST not only improves the logical robustness and correctness of rationales but also improves reasoning abilities compared to previous self-training approaches.</p></details> | Under review |

Few studies have concentrated on taking the textual instruction into improving visual representation, resulting in losing focus in some vision-centric tasks, a phenomenon we herein termed as Amblyopia. In this work, we introduce Panther, a MLLM that closely adheres to user instruction and locates targets of interests precisely, with the finesse of a black panther. Specifically, Panther comprises three integral components: Panther-VE, Panther-Bridge, and Panther-Decoder. Panther-VE integrates user instruction information at the early stages of the vision encoder, thereby extracting the most relevant and useful visual representations. The Panther-Bridge module, equipped with powerful filtering capabilities, significantly reduces redundant visual information, leading to a substantial savings in training costs. The Panther-Decoder is versatile and can be employed with any decoder-only architecture of LLMs without discrimination. Experimental results, particularly on vision-centric benchmarks, have demonstrated the effectiveness of Panther.</p></details> |  |

The track incorporates a Personal Textual Knowledge Base (PTKB) alongside Conversational AI tasks, such as passage ranking and response generation. Query Rewrite being an effective approach for resolving conversational context, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs), as query rewriters. Specifically, our submitted runs explore multi-aspect query generation using the MQ4CS framework, which we further enhance with Learned Sparse Retrieval via the SPLADE architecture, coupled with robust cross-encoder models. We also propose an alternative to the previous interleaving strategy, aggregating multiple aspects during the reranking phase. Our findings indicate that multi-aspect query generation is effective in enhancing performance when integrated with advanced retrieval and reranking models. Our results also lead the way for better personalization in Conversational Search, relying on LLMs to integrate personalization within query rewrite, and outperforming human rewrite performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the risk of prompt injection allows for potential manipulation of LLM outputs. While numerous attack methods have been documented, achieving full control over these outputs remains challenging, often requiring experienced attackers to make multiple attempts and depending heavily on the prompt context. Recent advancements in gradient-based white-box attack techniques have shown promise in tasks like jailbreaks and system prompt leaks. Our research generalizes gradient-based attacks to find a trigger that is (1) Universal: effective irrespective of the target output; (2) Context-Independent: robust across diverse prompt contexts; and (3) Precise Output: capable of manipulating LLM inputs to yield any specified output with high accuracy. We propose a novel method to efficiently discover such triggers and assess the effectiveness of the proposed attack. Furthermore, we discuss the substantial threats posed by such attacks to LLM-based applications, highlighting the potential for adversaries to taking over the decisions and actions made by AI agents.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we provide one of the first comprehensive investigations into embedding-based regression and demonstrate that LLM embeddings as features can be better for high-dimensional regression tasks than using traditional feature engineering. This regression performance can be explained in part due to LLM embeddings over numeric data inherently preserving Lipschitz continuity over the feature space. Furthermore, we quantify the contribution of different model effects, most notably model size and language understanding, which we find surprisingly do not always improve regression performance.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

While there is an existing study utilizing LLMs to generate a visual novel game, the previous study involved a manual process of output extraction and did not provide flexibility in generating a longer, coherent story. We evaluate DCP/P against our baseline, which does not provide context history to an LLM and only relies on the initial story data. Through objective evaluation, we show that simply providing the LLM with a summary leads to a subpar story compared to additionally providing the LLM with the proper context of the story. We also provide an extensive qualitative analysis and discussion. We qualitatively examine the quality of the objectively best-performing generated game from each approach. In addition, we examine biases in word choices and word sentiment of the generated content. We find a consistent observation with previous studies that LLMs are biased towards certain words, even with a different LLM family. Finally, we provide a comprehensive discussion on opportunities for future studies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |

Among these, Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT rely on pooling layers to aggregate token-level embeddings into sentence-level representations. Common pooling mechanisms such as Mean, Max, and Weighted Sum play a pivotal role in this aggregation process. Despite their widespread use, the comparative performance of these strategies on different LLM architectures remains underexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates the effects of these pooling mechanisms on two prominent LLM families -- BERT and GPT, in the context of sentence-level sentiment analysis. Comprehensive experiments reveal that each pooling mechanism exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses depending on the task's specific requirements. Our findings underline the importance of selecting pooling methods tailored to the demands of particular applications, prompting a re-evaluation of common assumptions regarding pooling operations. By offering actionable insights, this study contributes to the optimization of LLM-based models for downstream tasks.</p></details> | 4 figures |

While large language models (LLMs) like GPT, LLAMA, and Gemini are far from error-free, they have shown promise in answering a variety of questions outside of security. We studied LLM performance in the area of end user security by qualitatively evaluating 3 popular LLMs on 900 systematically collected end user security questions. While LLMs demonstrate broad generalist ``knowledge'' of end user security information, there are patterns of errors and limitations across LLMs consisting of stale and inaccurate answers, and indirect or unresponsive communication styles, all of which impacts the quality of information received. Based on these patterns, we suggest directions for model improvement and recommend user strategies for interacting with LLMs when seeking assistance with security.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |

While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.</p></details> |  |

We present a method to efficiently collect text data for low-resource languages from the entire Common Crawl corpus. Our approach, UnifiedCrawl, filters and extracts common crawl using minimal compute resources, yielding mono-lingual datasets much larger than previously available sources. We demonstrate that leveraging this data to fine-tuning multilingual LLMs via efficient adapter methods (QLoRA) significantly boosts performance on the low-resource language, while minimizing VRAM usage. Our experiments show large improvements in language modeling perplexity and an increase in few-shot prompting scores. Our work and released source code provide an affordable approach to improve LLMs for low-resource languages using consumer hardware.

It addresses a long-standing challenge in automating netlist generation for analog circuits within circuit design automation. Automating this workflow could accelerate the creation of finetuned LLMs for analog circuit design and verification. We identify key challenges in this automation and evaluate the multi-modal capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, particularly GPT-4, to address these issues. We propose a three-step workflow to overcome current limitations: labeling analog circuits, prompt tuning, and netlist verification. This approach aims to create an end-to-end SPICE netlist generator from circuit schematic images, tackling the long-standing hurdle of accurate netlist generation. Our framework demonstrates significant performance improvements, tested on approximately 2,100 schematics of varying complexity. We open-source this solution for community-driven development.</p></details> |  |

LLM-based Q&A models have emerged as a promising alternative, allowing users to query partitions of configurations through prompts and receive answers based on learned patterns, thanks to transformer models pre-trained on vast datasets that provide generic configuration context for interpreting router configurations. Yet, current methods of partition-based prompting often do not provide enough network-specific context from the actual configurations to enable accurate inference. We introduce a Context-Aware Iterative Prompting (CAIP) framework that automates network-specific context extraction and optimizes LLM prompts for more precise router misconfiguration detection. CAIP addresses three challenges: (1) efficiently mining relevant context from complex configuration files, (2) accurately distinguishing between pre-defined and user-defined parameter values to prevent irrelevant context from being introduced, and (3) managing prompt context overload with iterative, guided interactions with the model. Our evaluations on synthetic and real-world configurations show that CAIP improves misconfiguration detection accuracy by more than 30% compared to partition-based LLM approaches, model checkers, and consistency checkers, uncovering over 20 previously undetected misconfigurations in real-world configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, naively applying SVD to derive residual paths causes suboptimal utilization of the low-rank representation capacity. Instead, we propose Training-free Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation (EoRA), a method that directly minimizes compression-induced errors without requiring gradient-based training, achieving fast optimization in minutes using a small amount of calibration data. EoRA projects compression errors into the eigenspace of input activations, leveraging eigenvalues to effectively prioritize the reconstruction of high-importance error components. Moreover, EoRA can be seamlessly integrated with fine-tuning and quantization to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. EoRA consistently outperforms previous methods in compensating errors for compressed LLaMA2/3 models on various tasks, such as language generation, commonsense reasoning, and math reasoning tasks (e.g., 31.31%/12.88% and 9.69% improvements on ARC-Easy/ARC-Challenge and MathQA when compensating LLaMA3-8B that is quantized to 4-bit and pruned to 2:4 sparsity). EoRA offers a scalable, training-free solution to compensate for compression errors, making it a powerful tool to deploy LLMs in various capacity and efficiency requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing End-To-End Autonomous Driving In Real-World Environments Using Zero-Shot LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14256v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional autonomous driving methods adopt a modular design, decomposing tasks into sub-tasks. In contrast, end-to-end autonomous driving directly outputs actions from raw sensor data, avoiding error accumulation. However, training an end-to-end model requires a comprehensive dataset; otherwise, the model exhibits poor generalization capabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been applied to enhance the generalization capabilities of end-to-end driving models. Most studies explore LLMs in an open-loop manner, where the output actions are compared to those of experts without direct feedback from the real world, while others examine closed-loop results only in simulations. This paper proposes an efficient architecture that integrates multimodal LLMs into end-to-end driving models operating in closed-loop settings in real-world environments. In our architecture, the LLM periodically processes raw sensor data to generate high-level driving instructions, effectively guiding the end-to-end model, even at a slower rate than the raw sensor data. This architecture relaxes the trade-off between the latency and inference quality of the LLM. It also allows us to choose from a wide variety of LLMs to improve high-level driving instructions and minimize fine-tuning costs. Consequently, our architecture reduces data collection requirements because the LLMs do not directly output actions; we only need to train a simple imitation learning model to output actions. In our experiments, the training data for the end-to-end model in a real-world environment consists of only simple obstacle configurations with one traffic cone, while the test environment is more complex and contains multiple obstacles placed in various positions. Experiments show that the proposed architecture enhances the generalization capabilities of the end-to-end model even without fine-tuning the LLM.</p></details> |  |

However, in the pursuit of carbon neutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, existing AI-assisted design automation faces significant limitations in explainability, scalability, and usability. To address these challenges, we propose LP-COMDA, an LLM-based, physics-informed autonomous agent that automates the modulation design of power converters in Power Electronics Systems with minimal human supervision. Unlike traditional AI-assisted approaches, LP-COMDA contains an LLM-based planner that gathers and validates design specifications through a user-friendly chat interface. The planner then coordinates with physics-informed design and optimization tools to iteratively generate and refine modulation designs autonomously. Through the chat interface, LP-COMDA provides an explainable design process, presenting explanations and charts. Experiments show that LP-COMDA outperforms all baseline methods, achieving a 63.2% reduction in error compared to the second-best benchmark method in terms of standard mean absolute error. Furthermore, empirical studies with 20 experts conclude that design time with LP-COMDA is over 33 times faster than conventional methods, showing its significant improvement on design efficiency over the current processes.</p></details> |  |

These queries are challenging for feedback-based rankings due to sparse user engagement and limited feedback, making LLMs' ranking ability highly valuable. However, the large size and slow inference of LLMs necessitate the development of smaller, more efficient models (sLLMs). Recently, integrating ranking label generation into distillation techniques has become crucial, but existing methods underutilize LLMs' capabilities and are cumbersome. Our research, RRADistill: Re-Ranking Ability Distillation, propose an efficient label generation pipeline and novel sLLM training methods for both encoder and decoder models. We introduce an encoder-based method using a Term Control Layer to capture term matching signals and a decoder-based model with a ranking layer for enhanced understanding. A/B testing on a Korean-based search platform, validates the effectiveness of our approach in improving re-ranking for long-tail queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Industry Track.

While being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural jailbreak prompts that are easy to detect by safety filters or require high computational overhead due to discrete token optimization. Witnessing the limitations of existing jailbreak methods, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel framework that combines human-readable prompt generation with Latent Bayesian Optimization (LBO) to improve adversarial suffix creation in a fully black-box setting. GASP leverages LBO to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the model to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence through a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Our experiments show that GASP can generate natural jailbreak prompts, significantly improving attack success rates, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 tables, 13 figures; under review at CVPR '25</p></details> |

The LLM agents can perceive, control, and get feedback from the environment so as to accomplish the given tasks in an autonomous manner. Besides the environment-interaction property, the LLM agents can call various external tools to ease the task completion process. The tools can be regarded as a predefined operational process with private or real-time knowledge that does not exist in the parameters of LLMs. As a natural trend of development, the tools for calling are becoming autonomous agents, thus the full intelligent system turns out to be a multi-LLM-agent system (MLAS). This paper discusses the technical and business landscapes of MLAS. Compared to the previous single-LLM-agent system, a MLAS has the advantages of i) higher potential of task-solving performance, ii) higher flexibility for system changing, iii) proprietary data preserving for each participating entity, and iv) feasibility of monetization for each entity. To support the ecosystem of MLAS, we provide a preliminary version of such MLAS protocol considering technical requirements, data privacy, and business incentives. As such, MLAS would be a practical solution to achieve artificial collective intelligence in the near future.</p></details> |  |

Especially, the GPT-4o's excellent duplex speech interaction ability has brought impressive experience to users. Researchers have recently proposed several multi-modal LLMs in this direction that can achieve user-agent speech-to-speech conversations. This paper proposes a novel speech-text multimodal LLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main contribution is that the speech input and output modalities can be easily connected to a textual LLM while keeping the LLM's parameters frozen throughout the training process. We design a three-stage training strategy for modeling both the speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain speech-to-speech conversation ability using text-speech paired data (such as ASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&A data on 8 GPUs. Moreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in the speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text modality of its backbone LLM, while achieving low latency end-to-end spoken response. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue ability through multi-task training, giving Freeze-Omni a more natural style of dialogue ability between users and agents. In summary, Freeze-Omni holds great potential to conduct speech-to-speech dialogue based on a multimodal LLM under the condition of a frozen LLM, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by limited data and training resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://freeze-omni.github.io/</p></details> |

While numerous approaches have been proposed for this task, they primarily address common, widespread errors and struggle to adapt to unique, evolving errors specific to individual code repositories. To fill this gap, we propose EvoCoder, a multi-agent continuous learning framework for issue code reproduction. EvoCoder adopts a reflection mechanism that allows the LLM to continuously learn from previously resolved problems and dynamically refine its strategies to new emerging challenges. To prevent experience bloating, EvoCoder introduces a novel hierarchical experience pool that enables the model to adaptively update common and repo-specific experiences. Our experimental results show a 20\% improvement in issue reproduction rates over existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, integrating our reproduction mechanism significantly boosts the overall accuracy of the existing issue-resolving pipeline.</p></details> |  |

With the increasing integration of LLMs in critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, and public administration, ensuring these models are resilient to adversarial attacks is vital for preventing misuse and upholding ethical standards. This competition focused on two distinct tracks designed to evaluate and enhance the robustness of LLM security frameworks. Track 1 tasked participants with developing automated methods to probe LLM vulnerabilities by eliciting undesirable responses, effectively testing the limits of existing safety protocols within LLMs. Participants were challenged to devise techniques that could bypass content safeguards across a diverse array of scenarios, from offensive language to misinformation and illegal activities. Through this process, Track 1 aimed to deepen the understanding of LLM vulnerabilities and provide insights for creating more resilient models.</p></details> |  |

They typically generate netlists that lack human interpretability. This is a problem as human designers heavily rely on the interpretability of circuit diagrams or schematics to intuitively understand, troubleshoot, and develop designs. Hence, to integrate domain knowledge effectively, it is crucial to translate ML-generated netlists into interpretable schematics quickly and accurately. We propose Schemato, a large language model (LLM) for netlist-to-schematic conversion. In particular, we consider our approach in the two settings of converting netlists to .asc files for LTSpice and LATEX files for CircuiTikz schematics. Experiments on our circuit dataset show that Schemato achieves up to 93% compilation success rate for the netlist-to-LaTeX conversion task, surpassing the 26% rate scored by the state-of-the-art LLMs. Furthermore, our experiments show that Schemato generates schematics with a mean structural similarity index measure that is 3xhigher than the best performing LLMs, therefore closer to the reference human design.</p></details> |  |

As attackers exploit LLMs to craft more convincing and evasive phishing emails, it is crucial to assess the resilience of current phishing defenses. In this study we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of traditional phishing detectors, such as Gmail Spam Filter, Apache SpamAssassin, and Proofpoint, as well as machine learning models like SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, in identifying both traditional and LLM-rephrased phishing emails. We also explore the emerging role of LLMs as phishing detection tools, a method already adopted by companies like NTT Security Holdings and JPMorgan Chase. Our results reveal notable declines in detection accuracy for rephrased emails across all detectors, highlighting critical weaknesses in current phishing defenses. As the threat landscape evolves, our findings underscore the need for stronger security controls and regulatory oversight on LLM-generated content to prevent its misuse in creating advanced phishing attacks. This study contributes to the development of more effective Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) by leveraging LLMs to generate diverse phishing variants that can be used for data augmentation, harnessing the power of LLMs to enhance phishing detection, and paving the way for more robust and adaptable threat detection systems.</p></details> |  |

To enhance user experience, a crucial challenge is developing systems that can balance content exploration and exploitation, allowing users to adjust their recommendation preferences. Intuitively, this balance can be achieved through a tree-structured representation, where depth search facilitates exploitation and breadth search enables exploration. However, current works face two challenges to achieve this target: (1) Euclidean methods fail to fully capture hierarchical structures and lack flexibility in balancing exploration-exploitation, while (2) hyperbolic approaches, despite better hierarchical modeling, suffer from insufficient semantic alignment due to their reliance on Euclidean text encoders. To address these challenges, we propose HARec, a hyperbolic representation learning framework that jointly aligns user-item collaborative information with textual descriptions in hyperbolic space. Our framework introduces two key technique novelty: (1) a hierarchical-aware graph-llm alignment mechanism that enables better hierarchical representation, and (2) a hyperbolic hierarchical tree structure that facilitates user-adjustable exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HARec consistently outperforms both Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines, achieving up to 5.49% improvement in utility metrics and 11.39% increase in diversity metrics.</p></details> |  |

Traditional visual editing tools require significant expertise, limiting accessibility. Recent strides in instruction-based editing have enabled intuitive interaction with visual content, using natural language as a bridge between user intent and complex editing operations. This survey provides an overview of these techniques, focusing on how LLMs and multimodal models empower users to achieve precise visual modifications without deep technical knowledge. By synthesizing over 100 publications, we explore methods from generative adversarial networks to diffusion models, examining multimodal integration for fine-grained content control. We discuss practical applications across domains such as fashion, 3D scene manipulation, and video synthesis, highlighting increased accessibility and alignment with human intuition.

However, the unprecedented power comes at the cost of significant computing intensity, suggesting long latency and large energy footprint. Key-Value Cache and Semantic Cache have been proposed as a solution to the above problem, but both suffer from limited scalability due to significant memory cost for each token or instruction embeddings. Motivated by the observations that most instructions are short, repetitive and predictable by LLMs, we propose to predict user-instructions by an instruction-aligned LLM and store them in a predictive cache, so-called InstCache. We introduce an instruction pre-population algorithm based on the negative log likelihood of instructions, determining the cache size with regard to the hit rate. The proposed InstCache is efficiently implemented as a hash table with minimal lookup latency for deployment. Experimental results show that InstCache can achieve up to 51.34% hit rate on LMSys dataset, which corresponds to a 2x speedup, at a memory cost of only 4.5GB.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, collecting high-quality and diverse data is both expensive and time-consuming. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Star-Agents framework, which automates the enhancement of data quality across datasets through multi-agent collaboration and assessment. The framework adopts a three-pronged strategy. It initially generates diverse instruction data with multiple LLM agents through a bespoke sampling method. Subsequently, the generated data undergo a rigorous evaluation using a dual-model method that assesses both difficulty and quality. Finaly, the above process evolves in a dynamic refinement phase, where more effective LLMs are prioritized, enhancing the overall data quality. Our empirical studies, including instruction tuning experiments with models such as Pythia and LLaMA, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Optimized datasets have achieved substantial improvements, with an average increase of 12% and notable gains in specific metrics, such as a 40% improvement in Fermi, as evidenced by benchmarks like MT-bench, Vicuna bench, and WizardLM testset.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEADRE: Multi-Faceted Knowledge Enhanced LLM Empowered Display Advertisement Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13789v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Display advertising provides significant value to advertisers, publishers, and users. Traditional display advertising systems utilize a multi-stage architecture consisting of retrieval, coarse ranking, and final ranking. However, conventional retrieval methods rely on ID-based learning to rank mechanisms and fail to adequately utilize the content information of ads, which hampers their ability to provide diverse recommendation lists. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging the extensive world knowledge of LLMs. However, three key challenges arise when attempting to maximize the effectiveness of LLMs: "How to capture user interests", "How to bridge the knowledge gap between LLMs and advertising system", and "How to efficiently deploy LLMs". To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel LLM-based framework called LLM Empowered Display ADvertisement REcommender system (LEADRE). LEADRE consists of three core modules: (1) The Intent-Aware Prompt Engineering introduces multi-faceted knowledge and designs intent-aware <Prompt, Response> pairs that fine-tune LLMs to generate ads tailored to users' personal interests. (2) The Advertising-Specific Knowledge Alignment incorporates auxiliary fine-tuning tasks and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs with ad semantic and business value. (3) The Efficient System Deployment deploys LEADRE in an online environment by integrating both latency-tolerant and latency-sensitive service. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LEADRE and validate the contributions of individual modules. Online A/B test shows that LEADRE leads to a 1.57% and 1.17% GMV lift for serviced users on WeChat Channels and Moments separately. LEADRE has been deployed on both platforms, serving tens of billions of requests each day.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we focus on journalistic interviews, a domain rich in grounding communication and abundant in data. We curate a dataset of 40,000 two-person informational interviews from NPR and CNN, and reveal that LLMs are significantly less likely than human interviewers to use acknowledgements and to pivot to higher-level questions. Realizing that a fundamental deficit exists in multi-turn planning and strategic thinking, we develop a realistic simulated environment, incorporating source personas and persuasive elements, in order to facilitate the development of agents with longer-horizon rewards. Our experiments show that while source LLMs mimic human behavior in information sharing, interviewer LLMs struggle with recognizing when questions are answered and engaging persuasively, leading to suboptimal information extraction across model size and capability. These findings underscore the need for enhancing LLMs' strategic dialogue capabilities.</p></details> |  |

As various jurisdictions enact legislation on AI safety, the concept of alignment must be defined and measured across different domains. This paper proposes an experimental framework to assess whether LLMs adhere to ethical and legal standards in the relatively unexplored context of finance. We prompt nine LLMs to impersonate the CEO of a financial institution and test their willingness to misuse customer assets to repay outstanding corporate debt. Beginning with a baseline configuration, we adjust preferences, incentives and constraints, analyzing the impact of each adjustment with logistic regression. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in the baseline propensity for unethical behavior of LLMs. Factors such as risk aversion, profit expectations, and regulatory environment consistently influence misalignment in ways predicted by economic theory, although the magnitude of these effects varies across LLMs. This paper highlights both the benefits and limitations of simulation-based, ex post safety testing. While it can inform financial authorities and institutions aiming to ensure LLM safety, there is a clear trade-off between generality and cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Evaluation-Driven Approach to Designing LLM Agents: Process and Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13768v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of LLM agents capable of autonomously achieving under-specified goals and continuously evolving through post-deployment improvement, sometimes without requiring code or model updates. Conventional approaches, such as pre-defined test cases and code/model redevelopment pipelines, are inadequate for addressing the unique challenges of LLM agent development, particularly in terms of quality and risk control. This paper introduces an evaluation-driven design approach, inspired by test-driven development, to address these challenges. Through a multivocal literature review (MLR), we synthesize existing LLM evaluation methods and propose a novel process model and reference architecture specifically designed for LLM agents. The proposed approach integrates online and offline evaluations to support adaptive runtime adjustments and systematic offline redevelopment, improving runtime pipelines, artifacts, system architecture, and LLMs by continuously incorporating evaluation results, including fine-grained feedback from human and AI evaluators.</p></details> |  |

However, some tasks can be ambiguous -- i.e., they provide insufficient information to identify a unique interpretation -- or vague -- i.e., they do not clearly indicate where to draw the line when making a determination. Both ambiguity and vagueness can cause task indeterminacy -- the condition where some items in the evaluation corpus have more than one correct response. In this paper, we develop a framework for evaluating LLMs under task indeterminacy. Our framework disentangles the relationships between task specification, human ratings, and LLM responses in the LLM evaluation pipeline. Using our framework, we conduct a synthetic experiment showing that evaluations that use the "gold label" assumption underestimate the true performance. We also provide a method for estimating an error-adjusted performance interval given partial knowledge about indeterminate items in the evaluation corpus. We conclude by outlining implications of our work for the research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in NeurIPS 2024 Workshops on Evaluating Evaluations (EvalEval) and Statistical Foundations of LLMs and Foundation Models (SFLLM)</p></details> |
| **[AttentionBreaker: Adaptive Evolutionary Optimization for Unmasking Vulnerabilities in LLMs through Bit-Flip Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13757v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.</p></details> |  |

Five LLMs were tested to predict the gender for each role using single-word answers. We used Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to compare model outputs with human perceptions, statistical data, and the 50% neutrality benchmark. All LLMs showed significant deviation from gender neutrality and aligned more with statistical data, still reflecting inherent biases.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review for Coling conference</p></details> |

However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative or deceptive tactics to obtain positive feedback from users who are vulnerable to such strategies. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage. In our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of "feedback gaming" such as manipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some of our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler manipulative behaviors. We hope our results can serve as a case study which highlights the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL.</p></details> |  |

| **[Text-guided Image Restoration and Semantic Enhancement for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09059v2)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is to retrieve specific person images according to the given textual descriptions. A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, images often suffer from combinations of multiple degradation factors. Existing multiple-in-one IR models encounter challenges related to degradation diversity and prompt singularity when addressing this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple-in-one IR model that can effectively restore images with both single and mixed degradations. To address degradation diversity, we design a Local Dynamic Optimization (LDO) module which dynamically processes degraded areas of varying types and granularities. To tackle the prompt singularity issue, we develop an efficient Conditional Feature Embedding (CFE) module that guides the decoder in leveraging degradation-type-related features, significantly improving the model's performance in mixed degradation restoration scenarios. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we introduce a new dataset containing both single and mixed degradation elements. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance not only on mixed degradation tasks but also on classic single-task restoration benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we present Unsupervised Underwater Neural Radiance Field U2NeRF, a transformer-based architecture that learns to render and restore novel views conditioned on multi-view geometry simultaneously. Due to the absence of supervision, we attempt to implicitly bake restoring capabilities onto the NeRF pipeline and disentangle the predicted color into several components - scene radiance, direct transmission map, backscatter transmission map, and global background light, and when combined reconstruct the underwater image in a self-supervised manner. In addition, we release an Underwater View Synthesis UVS dataset consisting of 12 underwater scenes, containing both synthetically-generated and real-world data. Our experiments demonstrate that when optimized on a single scene, U2NeRF outperforms several baselines by as much LPIPS 11%, UIQM 5%, UCIQE 4% (on average) and showcases improved rendering and restoration capabilities.

However, this paradigm faces significant challenges when transferring to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks due to: 1) the domain gap between RGB and HSI features and difference on their structures, 2) information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and 3) difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation representations through text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework. By leveraging the frequency-aware feature modulation based on characteristics of HSI degradations, we decompose text prompts into intensity and bias controllers to effectively guide the restoration process while avoiding domain gaps. Our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance under various degradation combinations, indicating great potential for practical remote sensing applications. The source code and dataset will be publicly released.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

Unlike Retinex-based methods, our approach utilizes two color spaces - LAB and YUV - to efficiently separate and process color information, by leveraging the separation of luminance from chromatic components in color images. In addition, our model incorporates the Transformer architecture to comprehensively understand image content while maintaining computational efficiency. To dynamically balance the brightness in output images, we also introduce a Fourier transform module that adjusts the luminance channel in the frequency domain. This mechanism could uniformly balance brightness across different regions while eliminating background noises, and thereby enhancing visual quality. By combining these innovative components, LTCF-Net effectively improves low-light image quality while keeping the model lightweight. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics and datasets, achieving more natural color restoration and a balanced brightness distribution.</p></details> |  |

However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images.

| **[Efficient Diffusion Model for Image Restoration by Residual Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07319v3)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods have achieved remarkable success, they are still limited by the low inference speed attributed to the necessity of executing hundreds or even thousands of sampling steps. Existing acceleration sampling techniques, though seeking to expedite the process, inevitably sacrifice performance to some extent, resulting in over-blurry restored outcomes. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on three classical IR tasks, namely image super-resolution, image inpainting, and blind face restoration, \textit{\textbf{even only with four sampling steps}}.

Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by \textbf{even 0.35dB} PSNR for lightweight SR even with \textbf{9.3\% less} parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by \textbf{up to 0.29dB}.

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rotation Equivariant Proximal Operator for Deep Unfolding Methods in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15701v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deep unfolding approach has attracted significant attention in computer vision tasks, which well connects conventional image processing modeling manners with more recent deep learning techniques. Specifically, by establishing a direct correspondence between algorithm operators at each implementation step and network modules within each layer, one can rationally construct an almost ``white box'' network architecture with high interpretability. In this architecture, only the predefined component of the proximal operator, known as a proximal network, needs manual configuration, enabling the network to automatically extract intrinsic image priors in a data-driven manner. In current deep unfolding methods, such a proximal network is generally designed as a CNN architecture, whose necessity has been proven by a recent theory. That is, CNN structure substantially delivers the translational invariant image prior, which is the most universally possessed structural prior across various types of images. However, standard CNN-based proximal networks have essential limitations in capturing the rotation symmetry prior, another universal structural prior underlying general images. This leaves a large room for further performance improvement in deep unfolding approaches. To address this issue, this study makes efforts to suggest a high-accuracy rotation equivariant proximal network that effectively embeds rotation symmetry priors into the deep unfolding framework. Especially, we deduce, for the first time, the theoretical equivariant error for such a designed proximal network with arbitrary layers under arbitrary rotation degrees. This analysis should be the most refined theoretical conclusion for such error evaluation to date and is also indispensable for supporting the rationale behind such networks with intrinsic interpretability requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose TSFormer, an all-in-one framework that integrates \textbf{T}rusted learning with \textbf{S}parsification to boost both generalization capability and computational efficiency in UHD image restoration. The key is that only a small amount of token movement is allowed within the model. To efficiently filter tokens, we use Min-$p$ with random matrix theory to quantify the uncertainty of tokens, thereby improving the robustness of the model. Our model can run a 4K image in real time (40fps) with 3.38 M parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSFormer achieves state-of-the-art restoration quality while enhancing generalization and reducing computational demands. In addition, our token filtering method can be applied to other image restoration models to effectively accelerate inference and maintain performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frequency-Aware Guidance for Blind Image Restoration via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12450v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind image restoration remains a significant challenge in low-level vision tasks. Recently, denoising diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis. Guided diffusion models, leveraging the potent generative priors of pre-trained models along with a differential guidance loss, have achieved promising results in blind image restoration. However, these models typically consider data consistency solely in the spatial domain, often resulting in distorted image content. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-aware guidance loss that can be integrated into various diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Our proposed guidance loss, based on 2D discrete wavelet transform, simultaneously enforces content consistency in both the spatial and frequency domains. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in three blind restoration tasks: blind image deblurring, imaging through turbulence, and blind restoration for multiple degradations. Notably, our method achieves a significant improvement in PSNR score, with a remarkable enhancement of 3.72\,dB in image deblurring. Moreover, our method exhibits superior capability in generating images with rich details and reduced distortion, leading to the best visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, has been accepted by the ECCV 2024: AIM workshop</p></details> |
| **[Versatile Cataract Fundus Image Restoration Model Utilizing Unpaired Cataract and High-quality Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12278v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cataract is one of the most common blinding eye diseases and can be treated by surgery. However, because cataract patients may also suffer from other blinding eye diseases, ophthalmologists must diagnose them before surgery. The cloudy lens of cataract patients forms a hazy degeneration in the fundus images, making it challenging to observe the patient's fundus vessels, which brings difficulties to the diagnosis process. To address this issue, this paper establishes a new cataract image restoration method named Catintell. It contains a cataract image synthesizing model, Catintell-Syn, and a restoration model, Catintell-Res. Catintell-Syn uses GAN architecture with fully unsupervised data to generate paired cataract-like images with realistic style and texture rather than the conventional Gaussian degradation algorithm. Meanwhile, Catintell-Res is an image restoration network that can improve the quality of real cataract fundus images using the knowledge learned from synthetic cataract images. Extensive experiments show that Catintell-Res outperforms other cataract image restoration methods in PSNR with 39.03 and SSIM with 0.9476. Furthermore, the universal restoration ability that Catintell-Res gained from unpaired cataract images can process cataract images from various datasets. We hope the models can help ophthalmologists identify other blinding eye diseases of cataract patients and inspire more medical image restoration methods in the future.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various unknown degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different types of degradation, forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration plug-and-play method that generates parameters based on the input image and thus makes the model to adapt to specific degradation dynamically. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and All-in-One settings. Notably, our proposed model Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve a given small enough error, our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to mainstream embedding-based All-in-One methods.

| **[HAT: Hybrid Attention Transformer for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05239v2)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have shown impressive performance in image restoration tasks, such as image super-resolution and denoising. However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for better restoration, we propose a new Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines both channel attention and window-based self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a same-task pre-training strategy to further exploit the potential of the model for further improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We further scale up the model to show that the performance of the SR task can be greatly improved. Besides, we extend HAT to more image restoration applications, including real-world image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising and image compression artifacts reduction. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that our HAT achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Nevertheless, handling the complex and diverse degradations encountered in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To tackle this, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network. In the fine-tuning stage, we refine the pre-trained IR network through low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Built upon a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, LoRA-IR dynamically integrates multiple low-rank restoration experts through a degradation-guided router. This dynamic integration mechanism significantly enhances our model's adaptability to diverse and unknown degradations in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-IR achieves SOTA performance across 14 IR tasks and 29 benchmarks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Code and pre-trained models will be available at: https://github.com/shallowdream204/LoRA-IR.</p></details> |  |
| **[AllRestorer: All-in-One Transformer for Image Restoration under Composite Degradations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10708v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration models often face the simultaneous interaction of multiple degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing approaches typically handle single or composite degradations based on scene descriptors derived from text or image embeddings. However, due to the varying proportions of different degradations within an image, these scene descriptors may not accurately differentiate between degradations, leading to suboptimal restoration in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based restoration framework, AllRestorer. In AllRestorer, we enable the model to adaptively consider all image impairments, thereby avoiding errors from scene descriptor misdirection. Specifically, we introduce an All-in-One Transformer Block (AiOTB), which adaptively removes all degradations present in a given image by modeling the relationships between all degradations and the image embedding in latent space. To accurately address different variations potentially present within the same type of degradation and minimize ambiguity, AiOTB utilizes a composite scene descriptor consisting of both image and text embeddings to define the degradation. Furthermore, AiOTB includes an adaptive weight for each degradation, allowing for precise control of the restoration intensity. By leveraging AiOTB, AllRestorer avoids misdirection caused by inaccurate scene descriptors, achieving a 5.00 dB increase in PSNR compared to the baseline on the CDD-11 dataset.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

We propose the Probabilistic Prior Turbulence Removal Network (PPTRN), which combines probabilistic diffusion-based prior modeling with Transformer-driven feature extraction to address this issue. PPTRN employs a two-stage approach: first, a latent encoder and Transformer are jointly trained on clear images to establish robust feature representations. Then, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) models prior distributions over latent vectors, guiding the Transformer in capturing diverse feature variations essential for restoration. A key innovation in PPTRN is the Probabilistic Prior Driven Cross Attention mechanism, which integrates the DDPM-generated prior with feature embeddings to reduce artifacts and enhance spatial coherence. Extensive experiments validate that PPTRN significantly improves restoration quality on turbulence-degraded images, setting a new benchmark in clarity and structural fidelity.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 3 tables |

Current image restoration methods struggle to handle complex degradation while maintaining efficiency. This paper introduces a novel image restoration architecture that combines multi-dimensional dynamic attention and self-attention within a U-Net framework. To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks.

To this end, we develop an adaptive degradation-aware self-prompting model (ADSM) for all-in-one weather-degraded image restoration. Specifically, our model employs the contrastive language-image pre-training model (CLIP) to facilitate the training of our proposed latent prompt generators (LPGs), which represent three types of latent prompts to characterize the degradation type, degradation property and image caption. Moreover, we integrate the acquired degradation-aware prompts into the time embedding of diffusion model to improve degradation perception. Meanwhile, we employ the latent caption prompt to guide the reverse sampling process using the cross-attention mechanism, thereby guiding the accurate image reconstruction. Furthermore, to accelerate the reverse sampling procedure of diffusion model and address the limitations of frequency perception, we introduce a wavelet-oriented noise estimating network (WNE-Net). Extensive experiments conducted on eight publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both task-specific and all-in-one applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing algorithms often fail to effectively integrate multi-scale feature extraction with frequency enhancement, limiting their ability to reconstruct fine textures. Additionally, non-uniform blur in images also restricts the effectiveness of image restoration. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale frequency enhancement network (MFENet) for blind image deblurring. To capture the multi-scale spatial and channel information of blurred images, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction module (MS-FE) based on depthwise separable convolutions, which provides rich target features for deblurring. We propose a frequency enhanced blur perception module (FEBP) that employs wavelet transforms to extract high-frequency details and utilizes multi-strip pooling to perceive non-uniform blur, combining multi-scale information with frequency enhancement to improve the restoration of image texture details. Experimental results on the GoPro and HIDE datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior deblurring performance in both visual quality and objective evaluation metrics. Furthermore, in downstream object detection tasks, the proposed blind image deblurring algorithm significantly improves detection accuracy, further validating its effectiveness androbustness in the field of image deblurring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dropout the High-rate Downsampling: A Novel Design Paradigm for UHD Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06456v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the popularization of high-end mobile devices, Ultra-high-definition (UHD) images have become ubiquitous in our lives. The restoration of UHD images is a highly challenging problem due to the exaggerated pixel count, which often leads to memory overflow during processing. Existing methods either downsample UHD images at a high rate before processing or split them into multiple patches for separate processing. However, high-rate downsampling leads to significant information loss, while patch-based approaches inevitably introduce boundary artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel design paradigm to solve the UHD image restoration problem, called D2Net. D2Net enables direct full-resolution inference on UHD images without the need for high-rate downsampling or dividing the images into several patches. Specifically, we ingeniously utilize the characteristics of the frequency domain to establish long-range dependencies of features. Taking into account the richer local patterns in UHD images, we also design a multi-scale convolutional group to capture local features. Additionally, during the decoding stage, we dynamically incorporate features from the encoding stage to reduce the flow of irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on three UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring, show that our model achieves better quantitative and qualitative results than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | WACV2025 |
| **[A Modular Conditional Diffusion Framework for Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05993v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have been recently utilized to deal with various blind image restoration (IR) tasks, where they have demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of perceptual quality. However, the task-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational costs related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging to use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This hinders their wider adoption, especially by those who lack access to powerful computational resources and vast amount of training data. In this work we aim to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the performance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a relatively small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest. Moreover, the architecture of the proposed framework allows for a sampling strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function evaluations without suffering any performance loss, while it can also be combined with existing acceleration techniques such as DDIM. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality while it retains a competitive performance with respect to fidelity metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR) methods based on a pre-trained diffusion model have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, they have two fundamental limitations: 1) they often assume that the degradation operator is completely known and 2) they alter the diffusion sampling process, which may result in restored images that do not lie onto the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e, not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them.

In this context, the key issue lies in how to deal with different types of degraded images simultaneously. In this work, we present a Degradation-Aware Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (DA-RCOT) approach that models (all-in-one) image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we formalize image restoration with a residual-guided OT objective by exploiting the degradation-specific patterns of the Fourier residual in the transport cost. More crucially, we design the transport map for restoration as a two-pass DA-RCOT map, in which the transport residual is computed in the first pass and then encoded as multi-scale residual embeddings to condition the second-pass restoration. This conditioning process injects intrinsic degradation knowledge (e.g., degradation type and level) and structural information from the multi-scale residual embeddings into the OT map, which thereby can dynamically adjust its behaviors for all-in-one restoration. Extensive experiments across five degradations demonstrate the favorable performance of DA-RCOT as compared to state-of-the-art methods, in terms of distortion measures, perceptual quality, and image structure preservation. Notably, DA-RCOT delivers superior adaptability to real-world scenarios even with multiple degradations and shows distinctive robustness to both degradation levels and the number of degradations.</p></details> |  |

This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed. Furthermore, regarding underwater image restoration, Aquatic-GS outperforms representative dewatering methods in color correction, detail recovery, and stability.

| **[Chasing Better Deep Image Priors between Over- and Under-parameterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24187v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are well-known to act as over-parameterized deep image priors (DIP) that regularize various image inverse problems. Meanwhile, researchers also proposed extremely compact, under-parameterized image priors (e.g., deep decoder) that are strikingly competent for image restoration too, despite a loss of accuracy. These two extremes push us to think whether there exists a better solution in the middle: between over- and under-parameterized image priors, can one identify "intermediate" parameterized image priors that achieve better trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and even preserving strong transferability? Drawing inspirations from the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), we conjecture and study a novel "lottery image prior" (LIP) by exploiting DNN inherent sparsity, stated as: given an over-parameterized DNN-based image prior, it will contain a sparse subnetwork that can be trained in isolation, to match the original DNN's performance when being applied as a prior to various image inverse problems. Our results validate the superiority of LIPs: we can successfully locate the LIP subnetworks from over-parameterized DIPs at substantial sparsity ranges. Those LIP subnetworks significantly outperform deep decoders under comparably compact model sizes (by often fully preserving the effectiveness of their over-parameterized counterparts), and they also possess high transferability across different images as well as restoration task types. Besides, we also extend LIP to compressive sensing image reconstruction, where a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the prior (in contrast to untrained DIP or deep decoder), and confirm its validity in this setting too. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that LTH is demonstrated to be relevant in the context of inverse problems or image priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Chasing-Better-DIPs</p></details> |

While reducing injected radiation dose mitigates this risk, it often compromises image quality. To reconstruct full-dose-quality images from low-dose scans, we propose a Cycle-constrained Adversarial Denoising Convolutional Network (Cycle-DCN). This model integrates a noise predictor, two discriminators, and a consistency network, and is optimized using a combination of supervised loss, adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, identity loss, and neighboring Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset consisting of raw PET brain data from 1,224 patients, acquired using a Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner. Each patient underwent a 120-seconds brain scan. To simulate low-dose PET conditions, images were reconstructed from shortened scan durations of 30, 12, and 5 seconds, corresponding to 1/4, 1/10, and 1/24 of the full-dose acquisition, respectively, using a custom-developed GPU-based image reconstruction software. The results show that Cycle-DCN significantly improves average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), SSIM, and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) across three dose levels, with improvements of up to 56%, 35%, and 71%, respectively. Additionally, it achieves contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) values that closely align with full-dose images, effectively preserving image details, tumor shape, and contrast, while resolving issues with blurred edges. The results of reader studies indicated that the images restored by Cycle-DCN consistently received the highest ratings from nuclear medicine physicians, highlighting their strong clinical relevance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Nevertheless, it encounters challenges related to ill-posed problems, resulting in deviations between single model predictions and ground-truths. Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning technique, aims to address these deviations by combining the predictions of multiple base models. Most existing works adopt ensemble learning during the design of restoration models, while only limited research focuses on the inference-stage ensemble of pre-trained restoration models. Regression-based methods fail to enable efficient inference, leading researchers in academia and industry to prefer averaging as their choice for post-training ensemble. To address this, we reformulate the ensemble problem of image restoration into Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and employ an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm to estimate ensemble weights for aggregating prediction candidates. We estimate the range-wise ensemble weights on a reference set and store them in a lookup table (LUT) for efficient ensemble inference on the test set. Our algorithm is model-agnostic and training-free, allowing seamless integration and enhancement of various pre-trained image restoration models. It consistently outperforms regression based methods and averaging ensemble approaches on 14 benchmarks across 3 image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring and deraining. The codes and all estimated weights have been released in Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages for main manuscript, additional 17 pages for appendix, 18 figures, 17MB</p></details> |

To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model. GenIR, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation & filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality images. Our second contribution, DreamClear, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restoration. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address. Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration.

| **[Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475v3)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. Hallucinations in these models create uncertainty about their reliability, raising major concerns about their practical application. This paper investigates this phenomenon through the lens of information theory, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through experiments with super-resolution and inpainting algorithms. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. Thus, we aim to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[D3: Deep Deconvolution Deblurring for Natural Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04815v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose to reformulate the blind image deblurring task to directly learn an inverse of the degradation model represented by a deep linear network. We introduce Deep Identity Learning (DIL), a novel learning strategy that includes a dedicated regularization term based on the properties of linear systems, to exploit the identity relation between the degradation and inverse degradation models. The salient aspect of our proposed framework is it neither relies on a deblurring dataset nor a single input blurry image (e.g. Polyblur, a self-supervised method). This framework detours the typical degradation kernel estimation step involved in most of the existing blind deblurring solutions by the proposition of our Random Kernel Gallery (RKG) dataset. The proposed approach extends our previous Image Super-Resolution (ISR) work, NSSR-DIL, to the image deblurring task. In this work, we updated the regularization term in DIL based on Fourier transform properties of the identity relation, to deliver robust performance across a wide range of degradations. Besides the regularization term, we provide an explicit and compact representation of the learned deep linear network in a matrix form, called Deep Restoration Kernel (DRK) to perform image restoration. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional and deep learning based deblurring methods, with at least an order of 100 lesser computational resources. The D3 model, both LCNN & DRK, can be effortlessly extended to the Image Super-Resolution (ISR) task as well to restore the low-resolution images with fine details. The D3 model and its kernel form representation (DRK) are lightweight yet robust and restore the blurry input in a fraction of a second.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real-ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real-ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model-based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps.

| **[Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900v4)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, images captured by high-mobility UAVs often suffer from motion blur cases, which significantly impedes the performance of advanced object detection algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative object detection algorithm specifically designed for blurry images, named DREB-Net (Dual-stream Restoration Embedding Blur-feature Fusion Network). First, DREB-Net addresses the particularities of blurry image object detection problem by incorporating a Blurry image Restoration Auxiliary Branch (BRAB) during the training phase. Second, it fuses the extracted shallow features via Multi-level Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (MAGFF) module, to extract richer features. Here, the MAGFF module comprises local attention modules and global attention modules, which assign different weights to the branches. Then, during the inference phase, the deep feature extraction of the BRAB can be removed to reduce computational complexity and improve detection speed. In loss function, a combined loss of MSE and SSIM is added to the BRAB to restore blurry images. Finally, DREB-Net introduces Fast Fourier Transform in the early stages of feature extraction, via a Learnable Frequency domain Amplitude Modulation Module (LFAMM), to adjust feature amplitude and enhance feature processing capability. Experimental results indicate that DREB-Net can still effectively perform object detection tasks under motion blur in captured images, showcasing excellent performance and broad application prospects.

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> |  |

Due to the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent attention has shifted towards leveraging diffusion priors for image restoration tasks. However, existing diffusion priors-based methods either consider simple noise types or rely on approximate posterior estimation, limiting their effectiveness in addressing structured and signal-dependent noise commonly found in real-world images. In this paper, we build upon diffusion priors and propose adaptive likelihood estimation and MAP inference during the reverse diffusion process to tackle real-world noise. We introduce an independent, non-identically distributed likelihood combined with the noise precision (inverse variance) prior and dynamically infer the precision posterior using variational Bayes during the generation process. Meanwhile, we rectify the estimated noise variance through local Gaussian convolution. The final denoised image is obtained by propagating intermediate MAP solutions that balance the updated likelihood and diffusion prior. Additionally, we explore the local diffusion prior inherent in low-resolution diffusion models, enabling direct handling of high-resolution noisy images. Extensive experiments and analyses on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level.

Traditional IR methods typically target specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance both convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this review, we delve into the AiOIR methodologies, emphasizing their architecture innovations and learning paradigm and offering a systematic review of prevalent approaches. We systematically categorize prevalent approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to advance this dynamic field. Our paper begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of cutting-edge designs based on factors such as prior knowledge and generalization capability. Next, we highlight key advancements in AiOIR, aiming to inspire further inquiry and innovation within the community. To facilitate a robust evaluation of existing methods, we collate and summarize commonly used datasets, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present an objective comparison of open-sourced methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners alike.

To achieve generalized image restoration, all-in-one methods have recently been proposed and shown potential for multiple restoration tasks using one single model. Despite the promising results, the existing all-in-one paradigm still suffers from high computational costs as well as limited generalization on unseen degradations. In this work, we introduce an alternative solution to improve the generalization of image restoration models. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), we aim to tune only a small number of parameters to adapt pre-trained restoration models to various tasks. However, current PETL methods fail to generalize across varied restoration tasks due to their homogeneous representation nature. To this end, we propose AdaptIR, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with orthogonal multi-branch design to capture local spatial, global spatial, and channel representation bases, followed by adaptive base combination to obtain heterogeneous representation for different degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AdaptIR achieves stable performance on single-degradation tasks, and excels in hybrid-degradation tasks, with fine-tuning only 0.6% parameters for 8 hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Deep learning-based image restoration has emerged as a promising solution capable of generating high-resolution and motion-artifact-free MRI images from low-resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition times or from motion-artifact-corrupted images. To facilitate clinical integration, a time- and GPU-efficient network with reliable accuracy is essential. In this study, we adopted a unified 2D deep learning framework for pseudo-3D MRI image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) and motion artifact reduction (MAR). The optimal down-sampling factors to optimize the acquisition time in SRR were identified. Training for MAR was performed using publicly available in vivo data, employing a novel standardized method to induce motion artifacts of varying severity in a controlled way. The accuracy of the network was evaluated through a pixel-wise uncertainty map, and performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrated that the down-sampling factor of 1x1x2 for x2 acceleration and 2x2x2 for x4 acceleration was optimal. For SRR, the proposed TS-RCAN outperformed the 3D networks of mDCSRN and ReCNN, with an improvement of more than 0.01 in SSIM and 1.5 dB in PSNR while reducing GPU load by up to and inference time by up to 90%. For MAR, TS-RCAN exceeded UNet's performance by up to 0.014 in SSIM and 1.48 dB in PSNR. Additionally, TS-RCAN provided uncertainty information, which can be used to estimate the quality of the reconstructed images. TS-RCAN has potential use for SRR and MAR in the clinical setting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fusion from Decomposition: A Self-Supervised Approach for Image Fusion and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12274v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion is famous as an alternative solution to generate one high-quality image from multiple images in addition to image restoration from a single degraded image. The essence of image fusion is to integrate complementary information from source images. Existing fusion methods struggle with generalization across various tasks and often require labor-intensive designs, in which it is difficult to identify and extract useful information from source images due to the diverse requirements of each fusion task. Additionally, these methods develop highly specialized features for different downstream applications, hindering the adaptation to new and diverse downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFusion++, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to enhance the versatility of feature representation for different image fusion tasks. DeFusion++ captures the image fusion task-friendly representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way, overcoming the constraints of limited fusion datasets. Specifically, we introduce two innovative pretext tasks: common and unique decomposition (CUD) and masked feature modeling (MFM). CUD decomposes source images into abstract common and unique components, while MFM refines these components into robust fused features. Jointly training of these tasks enables DeFusion++ to produce adaptable representations that can effectively extract useful information from various source images, regardless of the fusion task. The resulting fused representations are also highly adaptable for a wide range of downstream tasks, including image segmentation and object detection. DeFusion++ stands out by producing versatile fused representations that can enhance both the quality of image fusion and the effectiveness of downstream high-level vision tasks, simplifying the process with the elegant fusion framework.</p></details> | 18page |

In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, dehazing, deblurring, desonwing, and deraining.

To address these issues, we propose a Temporal Consistency Network (TCN) cooperated with alignment smoothing to reduce jitters and flickers in restored videos. TCN is a flexible component that can be seamlessly plugged into the most advanced face image restoration algorithms, ensuring the quality of image-based restoration is maintained as closely as possible.

| **[MambaIR: A Simple Baseline for Image Restoration with State-Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15648v3)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen significant advancements in image restoration, largely attributed to the development of modern deep neural networks, such as CNNs and Transformers. However, existing restoration backbones often face the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation, hindering their application in practice. Recently, the Selective Structured State Space Model, especially the improved version Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a way to resolve the above dilemma. However, the standard Mamba still faces certain challenges in low-level vision such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In this work, we introduce a simple but effective baseline, named MambaIR, which introduces both local enhancement and channel attention to improve the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of the local pixel similarity and reduces the channel redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms SwinIR by up to 0.45dB on image SR, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field.

| **[A Preliminary Exploration Towards General Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15143v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the tremendous success of deep models in various individual image restoration tasks, there are at least two major technical challenges preventing these works from being applied to real-world usages: (1) the lack of generalization ability and (2) the complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing deep models, tailored for specific individual image restoration tasks, often fall short in effectively addressing these challenges. In this paper, we present a new problem called general image restoration (GIR) which aims to address these challenges within a unified model. GIR covers most individual image restoration tasks (\eg, image denoising, deblurring, deraining and super-resolution) and their combinations for general purposes. This paper proceeds to delineate the essential aspects of GIR, including problem definition and the overarching significance of generalization performance. Moreover, the establishment of new datasets and a thorough evaluation framework for GIR models is discussed. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing approaches for tackling the GIR challenge, illuminating their strengths and pragmatic challenges. By analyzing these approaches, we not only underscore the effectiveness of GIR but also highlight the difficulties in its practical implementation. At last, we also try to understand and interpret these models' behaviors to inspire the future direction. Our work can open up new valuable research directions and contribute to the research of general vision.</p></details> |  |

The requirement to tackle multiple degradations using the same model can lead to high-complexity designs with fixed configuration that lack the adaptability to more efficient alternatives. We propose DyNet, a dynamic family of networks designed in an encoder-decoder style for all-in-one image restoration tasks. Our DyNet can seamlessly switch between its bulkier and lightweight variants, thereby offering flexibility for efficient model deployment with a single round of training. This seamless switching is enabled by our weights-sharing mechanism, forming the core of our architecture and facilitating the reuse of initialized module weights. Further, to establish robust weights initialization, we introduce a dynamic pre-training strategy that trains variants of the proposed DyNet concurrently, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GPU hours. Our dynamic pre-training strategy eliminates the need for maintaining separate checkpoints for each variant, as all models share a common set of checkpoints, varying only in model depth. This efficient strategy significantly reduces storage overhead and enhances adaptability. To tackle the unavailability of large-scale dataset required in pre-training, we curate a high-quality, high-resolution image dataset named Million-IRD, having 2M image samples. We validate our DyNet for image denoising, deraining, and dehazing in all-in-one setting, achieving state-of-the-art results with 31.34\% reduction in GFlops and a 56.75\% reduction in parameters compared to baseline models. The source codes and trained models are available at https://github.com/akshaydudhane16/DyNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes updates where the DyNet variants now share the same weights during inference as well, eliminating the need to store separate weights and thereby reducing device storage requirements.

| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image restoration algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08688v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite previous works typically targeting isolated degradation types, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations which involve a complex interplay of multiple different isolated degradations. Recognizing the challenges posed by the exponential number of possible degradation combinations, we propose Universal Image Restoration (UIR), a new task setting that requires models to be trained on a set of degradation bases and then remove any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought which prompts LLMs to address problems step-by-step, we propose the Chain-of-Restoration (CoR), which instructs models to step-by-step remove unknown composite degradations. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR significantly improves model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving results comparable to or surpassing those of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations. The code will be released at https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[TANet: Triplet Attention Network for All-In-One Adverse Weather Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08177v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather image restoration aims to remove unwanted degraded artifacts, such as haze, rain, and snow, caused by adverse weather conditions. Existing methods achieve remarkable results for addressing single-weather conditions. However, they face challenges when encountering unpredictable weather conditions, which often happen in real-world scenarios. Although different weather conditions exhibit different degradation patterns, they share common characteristics that are highly related and complementary, such as occlusions caused by degradation patterns, color distortion, and contrast attenuation due to the scattering of atmospheric particles. Therefore, we focus on leveraging common knowledge across multiple weather conditions to restore images in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose a Triplet Attention Network (TANet) to efficiently and effectively address all-in-one adverse weather image restoration. TANet consists of Triplet Attention Block (TAB) that incorporates three types of attention mechanisms: Local Pixel-wise Attention (LPA) and Global Strip-wise Attention (GSA) to address occlusions caused by non-uniform degradation patterns, and Global Distribution Attention (GDA) to address color distortion and contrast attenuation caused by atmospheric phenomena. By leveraging common knowledge shared across different weather conditions, TANet successfully addresses multiple weather conditions in a unified manner. Experimental results show that TANet efficiently and effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance in all-in-one adverse weather image restoration.

Despite the impressive results achieved by these I2I models, their practical utility is hampered by their large model size and the computational burden of the iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel compression method tailored for diffusion-based I2I models. Based on the observations that the image conditions of I2I models already provide rich information on image structures, and that the time steps with a larger impact tend to be biased, we develop surprisingly simple yet effective approaches for reducing the model size and latency. We validate the effectiveness of our method on three representative I2I tasks: InstructPix2Pix for image editing, StableSR for image restoration, and ControlNet for image-conditional image generation. Our approach achieves satisfactory output quality with 39.2%, 56.4% and 39.2% reduction in model footprint, as well as 81.4%, 68.7% and 31.1% decrease in latency to InstructPix2Pix, StableSR and ControlNet, respectively.</p></details> | ACCV 2024 |

An effective strategy is to incorporate prior knowledge, either from human input or generative model. In this paper, we introduce Instant-reference Image Restoration (InstantIR), a novel diffusion-based BIR method which dynamically adjusts generation condition during inference. We first extract a compact representation of the input via a pre-trained vision encoder. At each generation step, this representation is used to decode current diffusion latent and instantiate it in the generative prior. The degraded image is then encoded with this reference, providing robust generation condition. We observe the variance of generative references fluctuate with degradation intensity, which we further leverage as an indicator for developing a sampling algorithm adaptive to input quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate InstantIR achieves state-of-the-art performance and offering outstanding visual quality. Through modulating generative references with textual description, InstantIR can restore extreme degradation and additionally feature creative restoration.</p></details> |  |

Despite the outstanding performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted the application of image restoration. To lift the restriction, it is required to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning approaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint. However, it fails to account for different computational complexities and performance requirements for different layers of an image restoration network. To further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the restoration accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method which outperforms previous pruning methods significantly.

However, existing LRMs often suffer from the hallucination dilemma, i.e., producing incorrect contents or textures when dealing with severe degradations, due to their heavy reliance on limited internal knowledge. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal solution called the Retrieval-augmented Framework for Image Restoration (ReFIR), which incorporates retrieved images as external knowledge to extend the knowledge boundary of existing LRMs in generating details faithful to the original scene. Specifically, we first introduce the nearest neighbor lookup to retrieve content-relevant high-quality images as reference, after which we propose the cross-image injection to modify existing LRMs to utilize high-quality textures from retrieved images. Thanks to the additional external knowledge, our ReFIR can well handle the hallucination challenge and facilitate faithfully results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFIR can achieve not only high-fidelity but also realistic restoration results. Importantly, our ReFIR requires no training and is adaptable to various LRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Learning Efficient and Effective Trajectories for Differential Equation-based Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04811v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The differential equation-based image restoration approach aims to establish learnable trajectories connecting high-quality images to a tractable distribution, e.g., low-quality images or a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the significant superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

| **[SITCOM: Step-wise Triple-Consistent Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04479v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative models that allow sampling from a distribution learned over a training set. When applied to solving inverse imaging problems (IPs), the reverse sampling steps of DMs are typically modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution in the image space. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (such as in the presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier sampling steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces the standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions, either implicitly or explicitly, our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our accelerated method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, under different levels of measurement noise, our extensive experiments across five linear and three non-linear image restoration tasks demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard image similarity metrics while requiring a significantly reduced run-time across all considered tasks.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging a blend of attribute text prompts, high-quality reference images, and identity information, MGFR can mitigate the generation of false facial attributes and identities often associated with generative face restoration methods. By incorporating a dual-control adapter and a two-stage training strategy, our method effectively utilizes multi-modal prior information for targeted restoration tasks. We also present the Reface-HQ dataset, comprising over 23,000 high-resolution facial images across 5,000 identities, to address the need for reference face training images. Our approach achieves superior visual quality in restoring facial details under severe degradation and allows for controlled restoration processes, enhancing the accuracy of identity preservation and attribute correction. Including negative quality samples and attribute prompts in the training further refines the model's ability to generate detailed and perceptually accurate images.</p></details> | 23 Pages, 28 Figures |

We consider the setting where the rank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a priori and use an objective function built from a rank-overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground truth. We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the rank of the ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix rank, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when it is stopped appropriately. We then propose an efficient stopping strategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects a nearly optimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with deep image prior, which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 10 figures</p></details> |

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets.

We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining.

| **[Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03463v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint. under review.

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://kangliao929.github.io/projects/noise-da/</p></details> |

Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking. In this paper, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from technical details to applications. We highlight the major advancements in deep learning-based single-image shadow removal methods, thoroughly review previous research across various categories, and provide insights into the historical progression of these developments. Additionally, we summarize performance comparisons both quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[TransRef: Multi-Scale Reference Embedding Transformer for Reference-Guided Image Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11528v3)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image inpainting for completing complicated semantic environments and diverse hole patterns of corrupted images is challenging even for state-of-the-art learning-based inpainting methods trained on large-scale data. A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking and Defending Protective Perturbation in Personalized Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18944v4)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized diffusion models (PDMs) have become prominent for adapting pretrained text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects using minimal training data. However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted datasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective perturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification methods attempt to mitigate this issue but often over-purify images, resulting in information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a latent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP embedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate noisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor generalization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic defense framework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning. We first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images with their original semantic meanings in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of personalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers fundamental shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its superiority over existing purification methods and stronger robustness against adaptive perturbation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/liuyixin-louis/DiffShortcut</p></details> |
| **[Posterior sampling via Langevin dynamics based on generative priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02078v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Posterior sampling in high-dimensional spaces using generative models holds significant promise for various applications, including but not limited to inverse problems and guided generation tasks. Despite many recent developments, generating diverse posterior samples remains a challenge, as existing methods require restarting the entire generative process for each new sample, making the procedure computationally expensive. In this work, we propose efficient posterior sampling by simulating Langevin dynamics in the noise space of a pre-trained generative model. By exploiting the mapping between the noise and data spaces which can be provided by distilled flows or consistency models, our method enables seamless exploration of the posterior without the need to re-run the full sampling chain, drastically reducing computational overhead. Theoretically, we prove a guarantee for the proposed noise-space Langevin dynamics to approximate the posterior, assuming that the generative model sufficiently approximates the prior distribution. Our framework is experimentally validated on image restoration tasks involving noisy linear and nonlinear forward operators applied to LSUN-Bedroom (256 x 256) and ImageNet (64 x 64) datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach generates high-fidelity samples with enhanced semantic diversity even under a limited number of function evaluations, offering superior efficiency and performance compared to existing diffusion-based posterior sampling techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00418v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods typically attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

Currently, CNN-transformer hybrid models provide state-of-the-art performance for these tasks. The key common ingredient in the architectural designs of these models is Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). We first show that CSA is an overall low-rank operation. Then, we propose an instance-Guided Low-rank Multi-Head selfattention (GLMHA) to replace the CSA for a considerable computational gain while closely retaining the original model performance. Unique to the proposed GLMHA is its ability to provide computational gain for both short and long input sequences. In particular, the gain is in terms of both Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and parameter count reduction. This is in contrast to the existing popular computational complexity reduction techniques, e.g., Linformer, Performer, and Reformer, for whom FLOPs overpower the efficient design tricks for the shorter input sequences. Moreover, parameter reduction remains unaccounted for in the existing methods.We perform an extensive evaluation for the tasks of spectral reconstruction from RGB images, spectral reconstruction from snapshot compressive imaging, motion deblurring, and image deraining by enhancing the best-performing models with our GLMHA. Our results show up to a 7.7 Giga FLOPs reduction with 370K fewer parameters required to closely retain the original performance of the best-performing models that employ CSA.</p></details> |  |

Despite performing effectively compared to single degradation restoration methods, they overlook the utilization of commonalities and specificities within multi-task restoration, thereby impeding the model's performance. Inspired by the success of deep generative models and fine-tuning techniques, we proposed a universal image restoration framework based on multiple low-rank adapters (LoRA) from multi-domain transfer learning. Our framework leverages the pre-trained generative model as the shared component for multi-degradation restoration and transfers it to specific degradation image restoration tasks using low-rank adaptation. Additionally, we introduce a LoRA composing strategy based on the degradation similarity, which adaptively combines trained LoRAs and enables our model to be applicable for mixed degradation restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple and mixed degradations demonstrate that the proposed universal image restoration method not only achieves higher fidelity and perceptual image quality but also has better generalization ability than other unified image restoration models.

However, these approaches often incur substantial memory requirements, particularly when processing ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. In this paper, we propose a novel image restoration method called MixNet, which introduces an alternative approach to global modeling approaches and is more effective for UHD image restoration. To capture the longrange dependency of features without introducing excessive computational complexity, we present the Global Feature Modulation Layer (GFML). GFML associates features from different views by permuting the feature maps, enabling efficient modeling of long-range dependency. In addition, we also design the Local Feature Modulation Layer (LFML) and Feed-forward Layer (FFL) to capture local features and transform features into a compact representation. This way, our MixNetachieves effective restoration with low inference time overhead and computational complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on four UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, underwater image enhancement, image deblurring and image demoireing, and the comprehensive results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a simple pipeline for all-in-one blind image restoration to Restore Anything with Masks (RAM). We focus on the image content by utilizing Mask Image Modeling to extract intrinsic image information rather than distinguishing degradation types like other methods. Our pipeline consists of two stages: masked image pre-training and fine-tuning with mask attribute conductance. We design a straightforward masking pre-training approach specifically tailored for all-in-one image restoration. This approach enhances networks to prioritize the extraction of image content priors from various degradations, resulting in a more balanced performance across different restoration tasks and achieving stronger overall results. To bridge the gap of input integrity while preserving learned image priors as much as possible, we selectively fine-tuned a small portion of the layers. Specifically, the importance of each layer is ranked by the proposed Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC), and the layers with higher contributions are selected for finetuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) presents a promising alternative by starting the generative process from corrupted images and leveraging training techniques from score-based diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce the Implicit Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^3$SB) to further accelerate the generative process of I$^2$SB. I$^3$SB reconfigures the generative process into a non-Markovian framework by incorporating the initial corrupted image into each step, while ensuring that the marginal distribution aligns with that of I$^2$SB. This allows for the direct use of the pretrained network from I$^2$SB. Extensive experiments on natural images, human face images, and medical images validate the acceleration benefits of I$^3$SB. Compared to I$^2$SB, I$^3$SB achieves the same perceptual quality with fewer generative steps, while maintaining equal or improved fidelity to the ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

However, modeling the degradations in the sRGB domain is complicated because of the Image Signal Processor (ISP) transformations. Despite of this known issue, very few methods in the literature work directly with sensor RAW images. In this work we tackle image restoration directly in the RAW domain. We design a new realistic degradation pipeline for training deep blind RAW restoration models. Our pipeline considers realistic sensor noise, motion blur, camera shake, and other common degradations. The models trained with our pipeline and data from multiple sensors, can successfully reduce noise and blur, and recover details in RAW images captured from different cameras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most exhaustive analysis on RAW image restoration.

However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

However, existing methods tend to degrade on double JPEG images, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for double JPEG artifacts removal, termed as OAPT. We conduct an analysis of double JPEG compression that results in up to four patterns within each 8x8 block and design our model to cluster the similar patterns to remedy the difficulty of restoration. Our OAPT consists of two components: compression offset predictor and image reconstructor. Specifically, the predictor estimates pixel offsets between the first and second compression, which are then utilized to divide different patterns. The reconstructor is mainly based on several Hybrid Partition Attention Blocks (HPAB), combining vanilla window-based self-attention and sparse attention for clustered pattern features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OAPT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 0.16dB in double JPEG image restoration task. Moreover, without increasing any computation cost, the pattern clustering module in HPAB can serve as a plugin to enhance other transformer-based image restoration methods.

Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases. In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation. This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks. We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively. Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement. Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design.

The former uses the stacking of convolutional layers with different convolutional kernel sizes to design the model, which enables the model to better extract the local features of the image; the latter uses the self-attention mechanism to design the model, which allows the model to establish long-distance dependencies between image pixel points through the self-attention mechanism and then better extract the global features of the image. However, both of the above methods face their problems. Based on this, this paper proposes a new lightweight multi-scale feature fusion network model based on two-way complementary convolutional and Transformer, which integrates the respective features of Transformer and convolutional neural networks through a two-branch network architecture, to realize the mutual fusion of global and local information. Meanwhile, considering the partial loss of information caused by the low-pixel images trained by the deep neural network, this paper designs a modular connection method of multi-stage feature supplementation to fuse the feature maps extracted from the shallow stage of the model with those extracted from the deep stage of the model, to minimize the loss of the information in the feature images that is beneficial to the image restoration as much as possible, to facilitate the obtaining of a higher-quality restored image. The practical results finally show that the model proposed in this paper is optimal in image recovery performance when compared with other lightweight models with the same amount of parameters.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing SR methods aim to achieve these goals by minimizing the corresponding yet conflicting losses, such as the $\ell_1$ loss and the adversarial loss. Unfortunately, the commonly used gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, are hard to balance these objectives due to the opposite gradient decent directions of the contradictory losses. In this paper, we formulate the perception-distortion trade-off in SR as a multi-objective optimization problem and develop a new optimizer by integrating the gradient-free evolutionary algorithm (EA) with gradient-based Adam, where EA and Adam focus on the divergence and convergence of the optimization directions respectively. As a result, a population of optimal models with different perception-distortion preferences is obtained. We then design a fusion network to merge these models into a single stronger one for an effective perception-distortion trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that with the same backbone network, the perception-distortion balanced SR model trained by our method can achieve better perceptual quality than its competitors while attaining better reconstruction fidelity.

Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The conclusion about reconstruction performance with the size of the latent variable is not stable, we must validate it before presenting it to other researchers</p></details> |

In recent years supervised learning approaches have become a popular strategy attempting to tackle this task. Unfortunately, most supervised learning-based methods are highly demanding in terms of computational resources and training data (sample complexity). In addition, trained models are sensitive to domain changes, such as varying acquisition systems, signal sampling rates, resolution and contrast. In this work, we try to answer a fundamental question: Can supervised learning models generalize well solely by learning from one image or even part of an image? If so, then what is the minimal amount of patches required to achieve acceptable generalization? To this end, we focus on an efficient patch-based learning framework that requires a single image input-output pair for training. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach for supervised image deblurring and super-resolution. Our results showcase significant improvement of learning models' sample efficiency, generalization and time complexity, that can hopefully be leveraged for future real-time applications, and applied to other signals and modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.14267</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture.

However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally, the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly, while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784v2)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation to develop empirically effective algorithms for image restoration. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments over multiple datasets across several restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling.Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.</p></details> |  |

Existing omnimatte methods assume a static background or accurate pose and depth estimation and produce poor decompositions when these assumptions are violated. Furthermore, due to the lack of generative prior on natural videos, existing methods cannot complete dynamic occluded regions. We present a novel generative layered video decomposition framework to address the omnimatte problem. Our method does not assume a stationary scene or require camera pose or depth information and produces clean, complete layers, including convincing completions of occluded dynamic regions. Our core idea is to train a video diffusion model to identify and remove scene effects caused by a specific object. We show that this model can be finetuned from an existing video inpainting model with a small, carefully curated dataset, and demonstrate high-quality decompositions and editing results for a wide range of casually captured videos containing soft shadows, glossy reflections, splashing water, and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gen-omnimatte.github.io/</p></details> |

In recent approaches this is facilitated by vision foundation models (VFM), which are pre-trained models that are effectively general-purpose feature extractors. The characteristics exhibited by these VFMs vary depending on the training data, network architecture, and training paradigm. The prevailing choice in this field are self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViT). This study assesses the influence of Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) backbones on zero-shot pose estimation. In order to facilitate a comparison between the two families of models on a common ground we adopt and modify a recent approach. Therefore, a template-based multi-staged method for estimating poses in a zero-shot fashion using LDMs is presented. The efficacy of the proposed approach is empirically evaluated on three standard datasets for object-specific 6DoF pose estimation. The experiments demonstrate an Average Recall improvement of up to 27% over the ViT baseline. The source code is available at: https://github.com/BvG1993/DZOP.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have shown promise by directly mapping raw sinogram data to PET images. However, DL approaches that are regression-based or GAN-based often produce overly smoothed images or introduce various artifacts respectively. Image-conditioned diffusion probabilistic models (cDPMs) are another class of likelihood-based DL techniques capable of generating highly realistic and controllable images. While cDPMs have notable strengths, they still face challenges such as maintain correspondence and consistency between input and output images when they are from different domains (e.g., sinogram vs. image domain) as well as slow convergence rates. To address these limitations, we introduce LegoPET, a hierarchical feature guided conditional diffusion model for high-perceptual quality PET image reconstruction from sinograms. We conducted several experiments demonstrating that LegoPET not only improves the performance of cDPMs but also surpasses recent DL-based PET image reconstruction techniques in terms of visual quality and pixel-level PSNR/SSIM metrics.

Despite their advantages, creating high-quality SVG content remains challenging, as it demands technical expertise with professional editing software and a considerable time investment to craft complex shapes. Recent text-to-SVG generation methods aim to make vector graphics creation more accessible, but they still encounter limitations in shape regularity, generalization ability, and expressiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce Chat2SVG, a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and image diffusion models for text-to-SVG generation. Our approach first uses an LLM to generate semantically meaningful SVG templates from basic geometric primitives. Guided by image diffusion models, a dual-stage optimization pipeline refines paths in latent space and adjusts point coordinates to enhance geometric complexity. Extensive experiments show that Chat2SVG outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity, path regularity, and semantic alignment. Additionally, our system enables intuitive editing through natural language instructions, making professional vector graphics creation accessible to all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://chat2svg.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking The Potential of Adaptive Attacks on Diffusion-Based Purification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16598v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based purification (DBP) is a defense against adversarial examples (AEs), amassing popularity for its ability to protect classifiers in an attack-oblivious manner and resistance to strong adversaries with access to the defense. Its robustness has been claimed to ensue from the reliance on diffusion models (DMs) that project the AEs onto the natural distribution. We revisit this claim, focusing on gradient-based strategies that back-propagate the loss gradients through the defense, commonly referred to as ``adaptive attacks". Analytically, we show that such an optimization method invalidates DBP's core foundations, effectively targeting the DM rather than the classifier and restricting the purified outputs to a distribution over malicious samples instead. Thus, we reassess the reported empirical robustness, uncovering implementation flaws in the gradient back-propagation techniques used thus far for DBP. We fix these issues, providing the first reliable gradient library for DBP and demonstrating how adaptive attacks drastically degrade its robustness. We then study a less efficient yet stricter majority-vote setting where the classifier evaluates multiple purified copies of the input to make its decision. Here, DBP's stochasticity enables it to remain partially robust against traditional norm-bounded AEs. We propose a novel adaptation of a recent optimization method against deepfake watermarking that crafts systemic malicious perturbations while ensuring imperceptibility. When integrated with the adaptive attack, it completely defeats DBP, even in the majority-vote setup. Our findings prove that DBP, in its current state, is not a viable defense against AEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Diffusion for Text-Driven Human Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16575v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since 2023, Vector Quantization (VQ)-based discrete generation methods have rapidly dominated human motion generation, primarily surpassing diffusion-based continuous generation methods in standard performance metrics. However, VQ-based methods have inherent limitations. Representing continuous motion data as limited discrete tokens leads to inevitable information loss, reduces the diversity of generated motions, and restricts their ability to function effectively as motion priors or generation guidance. In contrast, the continuous space generation nature of diffusion-based methods makes them well-suited to address these limitations and with even potential for model scalability. In this work, we systematically investigate why current VQ-based methods perform well and explore the limitations of existing diffusion-based methods from the perspective of motion data representation and distribution. Drawing on these insights, we preserve the inherent strengths of a diffusion-based human motion generation model and gradually optimize it with inspiration from VQ-based approaches. Our approach introduces a human motion diffusion model enabled to perform bidirectional masked autoregression, optimized with a reformed data representation and distribution. Additionally, we also propose more robust evaluation methods to fairly assess different-based methods. Extensive experiments on benchmark human motion generation datasets demonstrate that our method excels previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performances.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Representation Collapsing Problems in Vector Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16550v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector quantization is a technique in machine learning that discretizes continuous representations into a set of discrete vectors. It is widely employed in tokenizing data representations for large language models, diffusion models, and other generative models. Despite its prevalence, the characteristics and behaviors of vector quantization in generative models remain largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate representation collapse in vector quantization - a critical degradation where codebook tokens or latent embeddings lose their discriminative power by converging to a limited subset of values. This collapse fundamentally compromises the model's ability to capture diverse data patterns. By leveraging both synthetic and real datasets, we identify the severity of each type of collapses and triggering conditions. Our analysis reveals that restricted initialization and limited encoder capacity result in tokens collapse and embeddings collapse. Building on these findings, we propose potential solutions aimed at mitigating each collapse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study examining representation collapsing problems in vector quantization.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, under review</p></details> |

Optimizing the initial noisy latent offers a more efficient alternative to modifying model architectures or prompt engineering for improving semantic alignment. A latest approach, InitNo, refines the initial noisy latent by leveraging attention maps; however, these maps capture only limited information, and the effectiveness of InitNo is highly dependent on the initial starting point, as it tends to converge on a local optimum near this point. To this end, this paper proposes leveraging the language comprehension capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to guide the optimization of the initial noisy latent, and introduces the Noise Diffusion process, which updates the noisy latent to generate semantically faithful images while preserving distribution consistency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the condition under which the update improves semantic faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our framework, consistently enhancing semantic alignment across various diffusion models.

This paper explores two modeling approaches to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient for chloride transport. The first approach follows Gehlen's interpretable diffusion model, which is based on established physical principles and incorporates time and temperature dependencies in predicting chloride migration. The second approach is a neural network-based method, where the neural network approximates the effective diffusion coefficient. In a subsequent step, the calibrated models are used to predict the penetration depth of the critical chloride content, taking into account the uncertainty in the critical chloride content. The models are calibrated using experimental data measured by a wire sensor installed in a concrete test bridge. The calibration results are compared to effective diffusion coefficients derived from drilling dust samples. A comparison of both approaches reveals the advantages of the physics-based model in terms of transparency and interpretability, while the neural network model demonstrates flexibility and adaptability in data-driven predictions. This study emphasizes the importance of combining traditional and machine learning-based methods to improve the accuracy of chloride migration predictions in reinforced concrete.</p></details> |  |

Despite their remarkable potential, they pose significant privacy risk when misused for malicious purposes. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient adversarial attack method, Concept Protection by Selective Attention Manipulation (CoPSAM) which targets only the cross-attention layers of a T2I diffusion model. For this purpose, we carefully construct an imperceptible noise to be added to clean samples to get their adversarial counterparts. This is obtained during the fine-tuning process by maximizing the discrepancy between the corresponding cross-attention maps of the user-specific token and the class-specific token, respectively. Experimental validation on a subset of CelebA-HQ face images dataset demonstrates that our approach outperforms existing methods. Besides this, our method presents two important advantages derived from the qualitative evaluation: (i) we obtain better protection results for lower noise levels than our competitors; and (ii) we protect the content from unauthorized use thereby protecting the individual's identity from potential misuse.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Safe Generative AI Workshop (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world applications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the last frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are highly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional frames that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated when the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model with long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase significantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression step). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with Causal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces unidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional frames can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every subsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it shares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage cost. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Ca2-VDM achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative video generation results and significantly improves the generation speed.

Most existing methods focus on modifying the generation probabilities conditioned on the texts containing target concepts. However, they fail to guarantee the desired generation of texts unseen in the training phase, especially for the adversarial texts from malicious attacks. In this paper, we analyze the erasure task and point out that existing methods cannot guarantee the minimization of the total probabilities of undesired generation. To tackle this problem, we propose Dark Miner. It entails a recurring three-stage process that comprises mining, verifying, and circumventing. This method greedily mines embeddings with maximum generation probabilities of target concepts and more effectively reduces their generation. In the experiments, we evaluate its performance on the inappropriateness, object, and style concepts. Compared with the previous methods, our method achieves better erasure and defense results, especially under multiple adversarial attacks, while preserving the native generation capability of the models. Our code will be available at https://github.com/RichardSunnyMeng/DarkMiner-offical-codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Diffusion to Generate Them All](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16318v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce OneDiffusion, a versatile, large-scale diffusion model that seamlessly supports bidirectional image synthesis and understanding across diverse tasks. It enables conditional generation from inputs such as text, depth, pose, layout, and semantic maps, while also handling tasks like image deblurring, upscaling, and reverse processes such as depth estimation and segmentation. Additionally, OneDiffusion allows for multi-view generation, camera pose estimation, and instant personalization using sequential image inputs. Our model takes a straightforward yet effective approach by treating all tasks as frame sequences with varying noise scales during training, allowing any frame to act as a conditioning image at inference time. Our unified training framework removes the need for specialized architectures, supports scalable multi-task training, and adapts smoothly to any resolution, enhancing both generalization and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance across tasks in both generation and prediction such as text-to-image, multiview generation, ID preservation, depth estimation and camera pose estimation despite relatively small training dataset.

| **[An End-to-End Robust Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation Network with Single-Step Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16308v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) with a Noise-Conditional Framework (NCF) remain challenging for 3D scene understanding tasks, as the complex geometric details in scenes increase the difficulty of fitting the gradients of the data distribution (the scores) from semantic labels. This also results in longer training and inference time for DDPMs compared to non-DDPMs. From a different perspective, we delve deeply into the model paradigm dominated by the Conditional Network. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end robust semantic \textbf{Seg}mentation \textbf{Net}work based on a \textbf{C}onditional-Noise Framework (CNF) of D\textbf{D}PMs, named \textbf{CDSegNet}. Specifically, CDSegNet models the Noise Network (NN) as a learnable noise-feature generator. This enables the Conditional Network (CN) to understand 3D scene semantics under multi-level feature perturbations, enhancing the generalization in unseen scenes. Meanwhile, benefiting from the noise system of DDPMs, CDSegNet exhibits strong noise and sparsity robustness in experiments. Moreover, thanks to CNF, CDSegNet can generate the semantic labels in a single-step inference like non-DDPMs, due to avoiding directly fitting the scores from semantic labels in the dominant network of CDSegNet. On public indoor and outdoor benchmarks, CDSegNet significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffDesign: Controllable Diffusion with Meta Prior for Efficient Interior Design Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16301v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interior design is a complex and creative discipline involving aesthetics, functionality, ergonomics, and materials science. Effective solutions must meet diverse requirements, typically producing multiple deliverables such as renderings and design drawings from various perspectives. Consequently, interior design processes are often inefficient and demand significant creativity. With advances in machine learning, generative models have emerged as a promising means of improving efficiency by creating designs from text descriptions or sketches. However, few generative works focus on interior design, leading to substantial discrepancies between outputs and practical needs, such as differences in size, spatial scope, and the lack of controllable generation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DiffDesign, a controllable diffusion model with meta priors for efficient interior design generation. Specifically, we utilize the generative priors of a 2D diffusion model pre-trained on a large image dataset as our rendering backbone. We further guide the denoising process by disentangling cross-attention control over design attributes, such as appearance, pose, and size, and introduce an optimal transfer-based alignment module to enforce view consistency. Simultaneously, we construct an interior design-specific dataset, DesignHelper, consisting of over 400 solutions across more than 15 spatial types and 15 design styles. This dataset helps fine-tune DiffDesign. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DiffDesign.</p></details> | 32 pages |

Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

This study presents a data assimilation framework based on an ensemble Kalman filter that sequentially exploits and improves an advection-diffusion model in a case study concerning an airborne contaminant dispersion problem over a complex two-dimensional domain. An autonomous aerial drone is used to sequentially observe the actual contaminant concentration in a small fraction of the domain, orders of magnitude smaller than the total domain area. Such observations are synchronized with the data assimilation framework, iteratively adjusting the simulation. The path of the drone is sequentially optimized by balancing exploration and exploitation according to the available knowledge at each decision time. Starting from an erroneous initial model based on approximated assumptions that represent the limited initial knowledge available during emergency scenarios, results show how the proposed framework sequentially improves its belief about the dispersion dynamics, thus providing a reliable contaminant concentration map.</p></details> |  |

However, generating realistic soccer motions remains challenging due to the intricate interactions between the human player and the ball. In this paper, we introduce SMGDiff, a novel two-stage framework for generating real-time and user-controllable soccer motions. Our key idea is to integrate real-time character control with a powerful diffusion-based generative model, ensuring high-quality and diverse output motion. In the first stage, we instantly transform coarse user controls into diverse global trajectories of the character. In the second stage, we employ a transformer-based autoregressive diffusion model to generate soccer motions based on trajectory conditioning. We further incorporate a contact guidance module during inference to optimize the contact details for realistic ball-foot interactions. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale soccer motion dataset consisting of over 1.08 million frames of diverse soccer motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SMGDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of motion quality and condition alignment.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods mainly adopt 2D multiview diffusion models to generate intermediate multiview images, and use the Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) to create the final meshes. However, the multiview images exhibit local inconsistencies, and the meshes often lack fidelity to the input image or look blurry. We propose Fancy123, featuring two enhancement modules and an unprojection operation to address the above three issues, respectively. The appearance enhancement module deforms the 2D multiview images to realign misaligned pixels for better multiview consistency. The fidelity enhancement module deforms the 3D mesh to match the input image. The unprojection of the input image and deformed multiview images onto LRM's generated mesh ensures high clarity, discarding LRM's predicted blurry-looking mesh colors. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify Fancy123's SoTA performance with significant improvement. Also, the two enhancement modules are plug-and-play and work at inference time, allowing seamless integration into various existing single-image-to-3D methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/YuQiao0303/Fancy123</p></details> |
| **[Image Generation Diversity Issues and How to Tame Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16171v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative methods now produce outputs nearly indistinguishable from real data but often fail to fully capture the data distribution. Unlike quality issues, diversity limitations in generative models are hard to detect visually, requiring specific metrics for assessment. In this paper, we draw attention to the current lack of diversity in generative models and the inability of common metrics to measure this. We achieve this by framing diversity as an image retrieval problem, where we measure how many real images can be retrieved using synthetic data as queries. This yields the Image Retrieval Score (IRS), an interpretable, hyperparameter-free metric that quantifies the diversity of a generative model's output. IRS requires only a subset of synthetic samples and provides a statistical measure of confidence. Our experiments indicate that current feature extractors commonly used in generative model assessment are inadequate for evaluating diversity effectively. Consequently, we perform an extensive search for the best feature extractors to assess diversity. Evaluation reveals that current diffusion models converge to limited subsets of the real distribution, with no current state-of-the-art models superpassing 77% of the diversity of the training data. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Diffusion Models (DiADM), a novel approach that improves diversity of unconditional diffusion models without loss of image quality. We do this by disentangling diversity from image quality by using a diversity aware module that uses pseudo-unconditional features as input. We provide a Python package offering unified feature extraction and metric computation to further facilitate the evaluation of generative models https://github.com/MischaD/beyondfid.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 tables, 12 figures</p></details> |

Recent advancements in diffusion models and multimodal models have notably improved the quality and efficiency of 3D object generation given a single RGB image. However, 3D objects generated even by state-of-the-art methods are still unsatisfactory compared to human-created assets. Considering only textures instead of materials makes these methods encounter challenges in photo-realistic rendering, relighting, and flexible appearance editing. And they also suffer from severe misalignment between geometry and high-frequency texture details. In this work, we propose a novel approach to boost the quality of generated 3D objects from the perspective of Physics-Based Rendering (PBR) materials. By analyzing the components of PBR materials, we choose to consider albedo, roughness, metalness, and bump maps. For albedo and bump maps, we leverage Stable Diffusion fine-tuned on synthetic data to extract these values, with novel usages of these fine-tuned models to obtain 3D consistent albedo UV and bump UV for generated objects. In terms of roughness and metalness maps, we adopt a semi-automatic process to provide room for interactive adjustment, which we believe is more practical. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model is generally beneficial for various state-of-the-art generation methods, significantly boosting the quality and realism of their generated 3D objects, with natural relighting effects and substantially improved geometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2024 Conference Papers</p></details> |

Previous methods require attribute labels (e.g. background, color) or utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to mitigate biases. We introduce DiffuBias, a novel pipeline for text-to-image generation that enhances classifier robustness by generating bias-conflict samples, without requiring training during the generation phase. Utilizing pretrained diffusion and image captioning models, DiffuBias generates images that challenge the biases of classifiers, using the top-$K$ losses from a biased classifier ($f_B$) to create more representative data samples. This method not only debiases effectively but also boosts classifier generalization capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, DiffuBias is the first approach leveraging a stable diffusion model to generate bias-conflict samples in debiasing tasks. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that DiffuBias achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. We also conduct a comparative analysis of various generative models in terms of carbon emissions and energy consumption to highlight the significance of computational efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages + Appendix |

Our method, named FPA, goes beyond traditional techniques by faithfully simulating lighting conditions and material variations, ensuring a nuanced and realistic representation of textures on a 3D target. To achieve this, we employ a generative approach that learns adversarial patterns from a diffusion model. This involves incorporating a specially designed adversarial loss and covert constraint loss to guarantee the adversarial and covert nature of the camouflage in the physical world. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed camouflage in sticker mode, demonstrating its ability to cover the target without compromising adversarial information. Through empirical and physical experiments, FPA exhibits strong performance in terms of attack success rate and transferability. Additionally, the designed sticker-mode camouflage, coupled with a concealment constraint, adapts to the environment, yielding diverse styles of texture.

However, challenges remain in accurately modeling driving scenes and generating long videos. To alleviate these issues, we propose DreamForge, an advanced diffusion-based autoregressive video generation model tailored for 3D-controllable long-term generation. To enhance the lane and foreground generation, we introduce perspective guidance and integrate object-wise position encoding to incorporate local 3D correlation and improve foreground object modeling. We also propose motion-aware temporal attention to capture motion cues and appearance changes in videos. By leveraging motion frames and an autoregressive generation paradigm, we can autoregressively generate long videos (over 200 frames) using a 7-frame model, achieving superior quality compared to the baseline in 16-frame video evaluations. Finally, we integrate our method with the realistic simulation platform DriveArena to provide more reliable open-loop and closed-loop evaluations for vision-based driving agents.

However, the improved performance of DiTs comes at the expense of higher parameter counts and implementation costs, which significantly limits their deployment on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones. We propose DiTAS, a data-free post-training quantization (PTQ) method for efficient DiT inference. DiTAS relies on the proposed temporal-aggregated smoothing techniques to mitigate the impact of the channel-wise outliers within the input activations, leading to much lower quantization error under extremely low bitwidth. To further enhance the performance of the quantized DiT, we adopt the layer-wise grid search strategy to optimize the smoothing factor. Moreover, we integrate a training-free LoRA module for weight quantization, leveraging alternating optimization to minimize quantization errors without additional fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W4A8) quantization for DiTs while maintaining comparable performance as the full-precision model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025.

| **[An Unstructured Mesh Reaction-Drift-Diffusion Master Equation with Reversible Reactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00283v4)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a convergent reaction-drift-diffusion master equation (CRDDME) to facilitate the study of reaction processes in which spatial transport is influenced by drift due to one-body potential fields within general domain geometries. The generalized CRDDME is obtained through two steps. We first derive an unstructured grid jump process approximation for reversible diffusions, enabling the simulation of drift-diffusion processes where the drift arises due to a conservative field that biases particle motion. Leveraging the Edge-Averaged Finite Element method, our approach preserves detailed balance of drift-diffusion fluxes at equilibrium, and preserves an equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for particles undergoing drift-diffusion on the unstructured mesh. We next formulate a spatially-continuous volume reactivity particle-based reaction-drift-diffusion model for reversible reactions of the form $\textrm{A} + \textrm{B} \leftrightarrow \textrm{C}$. A finite volume discretization is used to generate jump process approximations to reaction terms in this model. The discretization is developed to ensure the combined reaction-drift-diffusion jump process approximation is consistent with detailed balance of reaction fluxes holding at equilibrium, along with supporting a discrete version of the continuous equilibrium state. The new CRDDME model represents a continuous-time discrete-space jump process approximation to the underlying volume reactivity model. We demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of the new CRDDME through a number of numerical examples, and illustrate its use on an idealized model for membrane protein receptor dynamics in T cell signaling.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Unsupervised Blind Face Restoration using Diffusion Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04618v3)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind face restoration methods have shown remarkable performance, particularly when trained on large-scale synthetic datasets with supervised learning. These datasets are often generated by simulating low-quality face images with a handcrafted image degradation pipeline. The models trained on such synthetic degradations, however, cannot deal with inputs of unseen degradations. In this paper, we address this issue by using only a set of input images, with unknown degradations and without ground truth targets, to fine-tune a restoration model that learns to map them to clean and contextually consistent outputs. We utilize a pre-trained diffusion model as a generative prior through which we generate high quality images from the natural image distribution while maintaining the input image content through consistency constraints. These generated images are then used as pseudo targets to fine-tune a pre-trained restoration model. Unlike many recent approaches that employ diffusion models at test time, we only do so during training and thus maintain an efficient inference-time performance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach can consistently improve the perceptual quality of pre-trained blind face restoration models while maintaining great consistency with the input contents. Our best model also achieves the state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025.

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, unposed observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of unbounded scenes with known camera poses using diffusion priors, these methods rely on explicit camera embeddings for extrapolating unobserved regions. This reliance limits their application in pose-free settings, where view-specific data is only implicitly available. To address this, we propose an instruction-following RGBD diffusion model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We also propose a novel confidence measure for Gaussian representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent Gaussian representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed reconstruction methods in complex $360^{\circ}$ scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[CDI: Copyrighted Data Identification in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12858v2)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models (DMs) benefit from large and diverse datasets for their training. Since this data is often scraped from the Internet without permission from the data owners, this raises concerns about copyright and intellectual property protections. While (illicit) use of data is easily detected for training samples perfectly re-created by a DM at inference time, it is much harder for data owners to verify if their data was used for training when the outputs from the suspect DM are not close replicas. Conceptually, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which detect if a given data point was used during training, present themselves as a suitable tool to address this challenge. However, we demonstrate that existing MIAs are not strong enough to reliably determine the membership of individual images in large, state-of-the-art DMs. To overcome this limitation, we propose CDI, a framework for data owners to identify whether their dataset was used to train a given DM. CDI relies on dataset inference techniques, i.e., instead of using the membership signal from a single data point, CDI leverages the fact that most data owners, such as providers of stock photography, visual media companies, or even individual artists, own datasets with multiple publicly exposed data points which might all be included in the training of a given DM. By selectively aggregating signals from existing MIAs and using new handcrafted methods to extract features for these datasets, feeding them to a scoring model, and applying rigorous statistical testing, CDI allows data owners with as little as 70 data points to identify with a confidence of more than 99% whether their data was used to train a given DM. Thereby, CDI represents a valuable tool for data owners to claim illegitimate use of their copyrighted data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Coda ...</summary><p>Coda available at https://github.com/sprintml/copyrighted_data_identification</p></details> |

To enhance robots' object manipulation capabilities, generating effective bimanual grasp poses is essential. Nevertheless, bimanual grasp synthesis for dexterous hand manipulators remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose the BimanGrasp algorithm for synthesizing bimanual grasps on 3D objects. The BimanGrasp algorithm generates grasp poses by optimizing an energy function that considers grasp stability and feasibility. Furthermore, the synthesized grasps are verified using the Isaac Gym physics simulation engine. These verified grasp poses form the BimanGrasp-Dataset, the first large-scale synthesized bimanual dexterous hand grasp pose dataset to our knowledge. The dataset comprises over 150k verified grasps on 900 objects, facilitating the synthesis of bimanual grasps through a data-driven approach. Last, we propose BimanGrasp-DDPM, a diffusion model trained on the BimanGrasp-Dataset.

While diffusion models have dominated this field, they face inherent limitations, including the multilevel-coherence challenge and implementation complexity, leading to suboptimal outcomes. In this paper, we introduce PanoLlama, a novel framework that redefines panoramic image generation as a next-token prediction task. Building on the pre-trained LlamaGen architecture, we generate images in an autoregressive manner and develop an expansion strategy to handle size limitations. This method aligns with the image token structure in a crop-wise and training-free manner, resulting in high-quality panoramas with minimal seams and maximum scalability. PanoLlama demonstrates its effectiveness and versatility in our experiments, achieving the best overall performance while offering flexibility for multi-scale, multi-layout, and multi-guidance generation.

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on instance-level object pose estimation and necessitate extensive training data, our method offers generalization to unseen objects without extensive training, operates with a single reference image of the object, and eliminates the need for 3D object models or multiple views of the object. These characteristics are achieved by utilizing a diffusion model to generate novel-view images and conducting a two-sided matching on these generated images. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing pose estimation techniques across both synthetic and real-world datasets. Remarkably, our approach maintains strong performance even in scenarios with significant viewpoint changes, highlighting its robustness and versatility in challenging conditions.

Given a 3D human motion and a textual description of the desired modification, our goal is to generate an edited motion as described by the text. The key challenges include the scarcity of training data and the need to design a model that accurately edits the source motion. In this paper, we address both challenges. We propose a methodology to semi-automatically collect a dataset of triplets comprising (i) a source motion, (ii) a target motion, and (iii) an edit text, introducing the new MotionFix dataset. Access to this data allows us to train a conditional diffusion model, TMED, that takes both the source motion and the edit text as input. We develop several baselines to evaluate our model, comparing it against models trained solely on text-motion pair datasets, and demonstrate the superior performance of our model trained on triplets. We also introduce new retrieval-based metrics for motion editing, establishing a benchmark on the evaluation set of MotionFix.

However, the large model sizes and iterative nature of inference make it difficult to deploy personalized diffusion models broadly on local devices with varying computational power. To this end, we propose a novel framework for efficient multi-user offloading of personalized diffusion models, given a variable number of users, diverse user computational capabilities, and fluctuating available computational resources on the edge server. To enhance computational efficiency and reduce storage burden on edge servers, we first propose a tailored multi-user hybrid inference manner, where the inference process for each user is split into two phases with an optimizable split point. The initial phase of inference is processed on a cluster-wide model using batching techniques, generating low-level semantic information corresponding to each user's prompt. Then, the users employ their own personalized model to add further details in the later inference phase. Given the constraints on edge server computational resources and users' preferences for low latency and high accuracy, we model the joint optimization of each user's offloading request handling and split point as an extension of the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP). Our objective is to maximize a comprehensive metric that accounts for both latency and accuracy across all users. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we transform the GQAP into an adaptive decision sequence, model it as a Markov decision process, and develop a hybrid solution combining deep reinforcement learning with convex optimization techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior optimality and low complexity compared to traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained subject details and frequently prioritize one form of guidance over the other, resulting in suboptimal subject encoding and an imbalance in the generated images. In this study, we uncover key insights into achieving high-quality balances on subject identity preservation and text-following, notably that 1) the design of the subject image encoder critically influences subject identity preservation, and 2) the text and subject guidance should take effect at different denoising stages. Building on these insights, we introduce a new approach, EZIGen, that employs two main components: a carefully crafted subject image encoder based on the pre-trained UNet of the Stable Diffusion model, following a process that balances the two guidances by separating their dominance stage and revisiting certain time steps to bootstrap subject transfer quality. Through these two components, EZIGen achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple personalized generation benchmarks with a unified model and 100 times less training data.

However, existing methods often suffer from facial distortions, inaccurate head movements, and limited fine-grained editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present DynamicAvatars, a dynamic model that generates photorealistic, moving 3D head avatars from video clips and parameters associated with facial positions and expressions. Our approach enables precise editing through a novel prompt-based editing model, which integrates user-provided prompts with guiding parameters derived from large language models (LLMs). To achieve this, we propose a dual-tracking framework based on Gaussian Splatting and introduce a prompt preprocessing module to enhance editing stability. By incorporating a specialized GAN algorithm and connecting it to our control module, which generates precise guiding parameters from LLMs, we successfully address the limitations of existing methods. Additionally, we develop a dynamic editing strategy that selectively utilizes specific training datasets to improve the efficiency and adaptability of the model for dynamic editing tasks.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches like Zero-1-to-3 have demonstrated promising results using conditional latent diffusion models, they face significant challenges in generating consistent and accurate novel views, particularly when handling multiple conditioning images. In this work, we conduct a thorough investigation of Zero-1-to-3's cross-attention mechanism within the Spatial Transformer of the diffusion 2D-conditional UNet. Our analysis reveals a critical discrepancy between Zero-1-to-3's theoretical framework and its implementation, specifically in the processing of image-conditional context. We propose two significant improvements: (1) a corrected implementation that enables effective utilization of the cross-attention mechanism, and (2) an enhanced architecture that can leverage multiple conditional views simultaneously. Our theoretical analysis and preliminary results suggest potential improvements in novel view synthesis consistency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Some tasks require recognizing objects far from the robot's camera. A challenging example is Ultra-Range Gesture Recognition (URGR) in human-robot interaction where the user exhibits directive gestures at a distance of up to 25~m from the robot. However, training a model to recognize hardly visible objects located in ultra-range requires an exhaustive collection of a significant amount of labeled samples. The generation of synthetic training datasets is a recent solution to the lack of real-world data, while unable to properly replicate the realistic visual characteristics of distant objects in images. In this letter, we propose the Diffusion in Ultra-Range (DUR) framework based on a Diffusion model to generate labeled images of distant objects in various scenes. The DUR generator receives a desired distance and class (e.g., gesture) and outputs a corresponding synthetic image. We apply DUR to train a URGR model with directive gestures in which fine details of the gesturing hand are challenging to distinguish. DUR is compared to other types of generative models showcasing superiority both in fidelity and in recognition success rate when training a URGR model. More importantly, training a DUR model on a limited amount of real data and then using it to generate synthetic data for training a URGR model outperforms directly training the URGR model on real data. The synthetic-based URGR model is also demonstrated in gesture-based direction of a ground robot.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art generative diffusion models have produced impressive results but struggle to achieve fast generation without sacrificing quality. On the one hand, previous works, like motion latent diffusion, conduct diffusion within a latent space for efficiency, but learning such a latent space can be a non-trivial effort. On the other hand, accelerating generation by naively increasing the sampling step size, e.g., DDIM, often leads to quality degradation as it fails to approximate the complex denoising distribution. To address these issues, we propose EMDM, which captures the complex distribution during multiple sampling steps in the diffusion model, allowing for much fewer sampling steps and significant acceleration in generation. This is achieved by a conditional denoising diffusion GAN to capture multimodal data distributions among arbitrary (and potentially larger) step sizes conditioned on control signals, enabling fewer-step motion sampling with high fidelity and diversity. To minimize undesired motion artifacts, geometric losses are imposed during network learning. As a result, EMDM achieves real-time motion generation and significantly improves the efficiency of motion diffusion models compared to existing methods while achieving high-quality motion generation. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

This paper introduces an Adversarial Feature Learning-based Semantic Communication method (AFLSC) for human body 3D reconstruction, which focuses on extracting and transmitting semantic information crucial for the 3D reconstruction task, thereby significantly optimizing data flow and alleviating bandwidth pressure. At the sender's end, we propose a multitask learning-based feature extraction method to capture the spatial layout, keypoints, posture, and depth information from 2D human images, and design a semantic encoding technique based on adversarial feature learning to encode these feature information into semantic data. We also develop a dynamic compression technique to efficiently transmit this semantic data, greatly enhancing transmission efficiency and reducing latency. At the receiver's end, we design an efficient multi-level semantic feature decoding method to convert semantic data back into key image features. Finally, an improved ViT-diffusion model is employed for 3D reconstruction, producing human body 3D mesh models. Experimental results validate the advantages of our method in terms of data transmission efficiency and reconstruction quality, demonstrating its excellent potential for application in bandwidth-limited environments.</p></details> |  |

Yet, large-scale text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, struggle to generate images where foreground objects are placed over a chroma key background, limiting their ability to separate foreground and background elements without fine-tuning. To address this limitation, we present a novel Training-Free Chroma Key Content Generation Diffusion Model (TKG-DM), which optimizes the initial random noise to produce images with foreground objects on a specifiable color background. Our proposed method is the first to explore the manipulation of the color aspects in initial noise for controlled background generation, enabling precise separation of foreground and background without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, matching or surpassing fine-tuned models. Finally, we successfully extend it to other tasks (e.g., consistency models and text-to-video), highlighting its transformative potential across various generative applications where independent control of foreground and background is crucial.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods often yield suboptimal results due to their ineffective utilization of 2D diffusion priors. The limitations manifest in two critical aspects: the inadequate capture of geometric information by pretrained diffusion models and the suboptimal guidance provided by existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) methods. To address these problems, we introduce GB-NeRF, a novel framework that enhances NeRF inpainting through improved utilization of 2D diffusion priors. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: a fine-tuning strategy that simultaneously learns appearance and geometric priors and a specialized normal distillation loss that integrates these geometric priors into NeRF inpainting. We propose a technique called Balanced Score Distillation (BSD) that surpasses existing methods such as Score Distillation (SDS) and the improved version, Conditional Score Distillation (CSD). BSD offers improved inpainting quality in appearance and geometric aspects. Extensive experiments show that our method provides superior appearance fidelity and geometric consistency compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Within diffusion frameworks, guidance techniques have proven effective in enhancing output quality during inference; however, applying these methods to video diffusion models introduces additional complexity of handling computations across entire sequences. To address this, we propose a novel framework called MotionPrompt that guides the video generation process via optical flow. Specifically, we train a discriminator to distinguish optical flow between random pairs of frames from real videos and generated ones. Given that prompts can influence the entire video, we optimize learnable token embeddings during reverse sampling steps by using gradients from a trained discriminator applied to random frame pairs. This approach allows our method to generate visually coherent video sequences that closely reflect natural motion dynamics, without compromising the fidelity of the generated content. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various models.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://motionprompt.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[MUNBa: Machine Unlearning via Nash Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15537v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto front, effectively avoiding the gradient conflicts. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving superior performance on several benchmarks. For example, in the challenging scenario of sample-wise forgetting, our algorithm approaches the gold standard retrain baseline. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the ability of ten popular Stable Diffusion models to generate harmful images, including NSFW, violent, and personally sensitive material. We demonstrate that these models respond to harmful prompts by generating inappropriate content, which frequently displays troubling biases, such as the disproportionate portrayal of Black individuals in violent contexts. Our findings demonstrate a complete lack of any refusal behavior or safety measures in the models observed.

SAR-to-EO (Electro-Optical) image translation (SET) has emerged to make SAR images more perceptually interpretable. However, traditional approaches trained from scratch on limited SAR-EO datasets are prone to overfitting. To address these challenges, we introduce Confidence Diffusion for SAR-to-EO Translation, called C-DiffSET, a framework leveraging pretrained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) extensively trained on natural images, thus enabling effective adaptation to the EO domain. Remarkably, we find that the pretrained VAE encoder aligns SAR and EO images in the same latent space, even with varying noise levels in SAR inputs. To further improve pixel-wise fidelity for SET, we propose a confidence-guided diffusion (C-Diff) loss that mitigates artifacts from temporal discrepancies, such as appearing or disappearing objects, thereby enhancing structural accuracy. C-DiffSET achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming the very recent image-to-image translation methods and SET methods with large margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page https://kaist-viclab.github.io/C-DiffSET_site/</p></details> |

Current state-of-the-art automatic evaluation methods heavily rely on Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly powerful commercial models like GPT-4o. While these models are highly effective, their substantial costs limit scalability in large-scale evaluations. Adopting open-source MLLMs is an alternative; however, their performance falls short due to significant limitations in processing multi-modal data compared to commercial MLLMs. To tackle these problems, we first propose a task decomposition evaluation framework based on GPT-4o to automatically construct a new training dataset, where the complex evaluation task is decoupled into simpler sub-tasks, effectively reducing the learning complexity. Based on this dataset, we design innovative training strategies to effectively distill GPT-4o's evaluation capabilities into a 7B open-source MLLM, MiniCPM-V-2.6. Furthermore, to reliably and comprehensively assess prior works and our proposed model, we manually annotate a meta-evaluation benchmark that includes chain-of-thought explanations alongside quality scores for generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled open-source MLLM significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art GPT-4o-base baseline, VIEScore, with over 4.6\% improvement in Spearman and Kendall correlations with human judgments.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness, the inherent memory restriction results in saving a limited number of exemplars with poor diversity. In this paper, we introduce PESCR, a novel approach that substantially increases the quantity and enhances the diversity of exemplars based on a pre-trained general-purpose diffusion model, without fine-tuning it on target datasets or storing it in the memory buffer. Images are compressed into visual and textual prompts, which are saved instead of the original images, decreasing memory consumption by a factor of 24. In subsequent phases, diverse exemplars are regenerated by the diffusion model. We further propose partial compression and diffusion-based data augmentation to minimize the domain gap between generated exemplars and real images. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PESCR significantly improves CIL performance across multiple benchmarks, e.g., 3.2% above the previous state-of-the-art on ImageNet-100.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Generation of Privacy-preserving Synthetic Electronic Health Record Time Series via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15290v5)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are rich sources of patient-level data, offering valuable resources for medical data analysis. However, privacy concerns often restrict access to EHRs, hindering downstream analysis. Current EHR de-identification methods are flawed and can lead to potential privacy leakage. Additionally, existing publicly available EHR databases are limited, preventing the advancement of medical research using EHR. This study aims to overcome these challenges by generating realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) time series efficiently. We introduce a new method for generating diverse and realistic synthetic EHR time series data using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). We conducted experiments on six databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV (MIMIC-III/IV), the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU), and non-EHR datasets on Stocks and Energy. We compared our proposed method with eight existing methods. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of data fidelity while requiring less training effort. Additionally, data generated by our method yields a lower discriminative accuracy compared to other baseline methods, indicating the proposed method can generate data with less privacy risk. The proposed diffusion-model-based method can reliably and efficiently generate synthetic EHR time series, which facilitates the downstream medical data analysis. Our numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over all other existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Augmentation for Supervised Graph Outlier Detection via Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17679v3)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge confronting supervised graph outlier detection algorithms is the prevalent problem of class imbalance, where the scarcity of outlier instances compared to normal instances often results in suboptimal performance. Recently, generative models, especially diffusion models, have demonstrated their efficacy in synthesizing high-fidelity images. Despite their extraordinary generation quality, their potential in data augmentation for supervised graph outlier detection remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GODM, a novel data augmentation for mitigating class imbalance in supervised Graph Outlier detection via latent Diffusion Models. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of GODM. The case study further demonstrated the generation quality of our synthetic data.

Existing acceleration sampling techniques, though seeking to expedite the process, inevitably sacrifice performance to some extent, resulting in over-blurry restored outcomes. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on three classical IR tasks, namely image super-resolution, image inpainting, and blind face restoration, \textit{\textbf{even only with four sampling steps}}.

While plausible appearance and talking effect are achieved, these methods still suffer from temporal, 3D or expression inconsistency due to the error accumulation and inherent limitation of single-image generation ability. In this paper, we propose ConsistentAvatar, a novel framework for fully consistent and high-fidelity talking avatar generation. Instead of directly employing multi-modal conditions to the diffusion process, our method learns to first model the temporal representation for stability between adjacent frames. Specifically, we propose a Temporally-Sensitive Detail (TSD) map containing high-frequency feature and contours that vary significantly along the time axis. Using a temporal consistent diffusion module, we learn to align TSD of the initial result to that of the video frame ground truth. The final avatar is generated by a fully consistent diffusion module, conditioned on the aligned TSD, rough head normal, and emotion prompt embedding. We find that the aligned TSD, which represents the temporal patterns, constrains the diffusion process to generate temporally stable talking head. Further, its reliable guidance complements the inaccuracy of other conditions, suppressing the accumulated error while improving the consistency on various aspects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistentAvatar outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the generated appearance, 3D, expression and temporal consistency.

| **[LDM-Morph: Latent diffusion model guided deformable image registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15426v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable image registration plays an essential role in various medical image tasks. Existing deep learning-based deformable registration frameworks primarily utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformers to learn features to predict the deformations. However, the lack of semantic information in the learned features limits the registration performance. Furthermore, the similarity metric of the loss function is often evaluated only in the pixel space, which ignores the matching of high-level anatomical features and can lead to deformation folding. To address these issues, in this work, we proposed LDM-Morph, an unsupervised deformable registration algorithm for medical image registration. LDM-Morph integrated features extracted from the latent diffusion model (LDM) to enrich the semantic information. Additionally, a latent and global feature-based cross-attention module (LGCA) was designed to enhance the interaction of semantic information from LDM and global information from multi-head self-attention operations. Finally, a hierarchical metric was proposed to evaluate the similarity of image pairs in both the original pixel space and latent-feature space, enhancing topology preservation while improving registration accuracy. Extensive experiments on four public 2D cardiac image datasets show that the proposed LDM-Morph framework outperformed existing state-of-the-art CNNs- and Transformers-based registration methods regarding accuracy and topology preservation with comparable computational efficiency.

| **[Speeding Up Speech Synthesis In Diffusion Models By Reducing Data Distribution Recovery Steps Via Content Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09652v3)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion based vocoders have been criticised for being slow due to the many steps required during sampling. Moreover, the model's loss function that is popularly implemented is designed such that the target is the original input $x_0$ or error $\epsilon_0$. For early time steps of the reverse process, this results in large prediction errors, which can lead to speech distortions and increase the learning time. We propose a setup where the targets are the different outputs of forward process time steps with a goal to reduce the magnitude of prediction errors and reduce the training time. We use the different layers of a neural network (NN) to perform denoising by training them to learn to generate representations similar to the noised outputs in the forward process of the diffusion. The NN layers learn to progressively denoise the input in the reverse process until finally the final layer estimates the clean speech. To avoid 1:1 mapping between layers of the neural network and the forward process steps, we define a skip parameter $\tau>1$ such that an NN layer is trained to cumulatively remove the noise injected in the $\tau$ steps in the forward process. This significantly reduces the number of data distribution recovery steps and, consequently, the time to generate speech. We show through extensive evaluation that the proposed technique generates high-fidelity speech in competitive time that outperforms current state-of-the-art tools. The proposed technique is also able to generalize well to unseen speech.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[FDDM: Unsupervised Medical Image Translation with a Frequency-Decoupled Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12070v3)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential in producing high-quality images in medical image translation to aid disease diagnosis, localization, and treatment. Nevertheless, current diffusion models have limited success in achieving faithful image translations that can accurately preserve the anatomical structures of medical images, especially for unpaired datasets. The preservation of structural and anatomical details is essential to reliable medical diagnosis and treatment planning, as structural mismatches can lead to disease misidentification and treatment errors. In this study, we introduce the Frequency Decoupled Diffusion Model (FDDM) for MR-to-CT conversion. FDDM first obtains the anatomical information of the CT image from the MR image through an initial conversion module. This anatomical information then guides a subsequent diffusion model to generate high-quality CT images. Our diffusion model uses a dual-path reverse diffusion process for low-frequency and high-frequency information, achieving a better balance between image quality and anatomical accuracy. We extensively evaluated FDDM using public datasets for brain MR-to-CT and pelvis MR-to-CT translations, demonstrating its superior performance to other GAN-based, VAE-based, and diffusion-based models. The evaluation metrics included Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). FDDM achieved the best scores on all metrics for both datasets, particularly excelling in FID, with scores of 25.9 for brain data and 29.2 for pelvis data, significantly outperforming other methods. These results demonstrate that FDDM can generate high-quality target domain images while maintaining the accuracy of translated anatomical structures.</p></details> |  |

However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.

A practical grasp synthesis system is required to generate a diverse set of 6-DoF grasps from which a task-relevant grasp can be executed. Although generative models are suitable for learning such complex data distributions, existing models have limitations in grasp quality, long training times, and a lack of flexibility for task-specific generation. In this work, we present GraspLDM, a modular generative framework for 6-DoF grasp synthesis that uses diffusion models as priors in the latent space of a VAE. GraspLDM learns a generative model of object-centric $SE(3)$ grasp poses conditioned on point clouds. GraspLDM architecture enables us to train task-specific models efficiently by only re-training a small denoising network in the low-dimensional latent space, as opposed to existing models that need expensive re-training. Our framework provides robust and scalable models on both full and partial point clouds. GraspLDM models trained with simulation data transfer well to the real world without any further fine-tuning. Our models provide an 80% success rate for 80 grasp attempts of diverse test objects across two real-world robotic setups. We make our implementation available at https://github.com/kuldeepbrd1/graspldm .</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient-Free Classifier Guidance for Diffusion Model Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15393v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generation using diffusion models have demonstrated outstanding learning capabilities, effectively capturing the full distribution of the training dataset. They are known to generate wide variations in sampled images, albeit with a trade-off in image fidelity. Guided sampling methods, such as classifier guidance (CG) and classifier-free guidance (CFG), focus sampling in well-learned high-probability regions to generate images of high fidelity, but each has its limitations. CG is computationally expensive due to the use of back-propagation for classifier gradient descent, while CFG, being gradient-free, is more efficient but compromises class label alignment compared to CG. In this work, we propose an efficient guidance method that fully utilizes a pre-trained classifier without using gradient descent. By using the classifier solely in inference mode, a time-adaptive reference class label and corresponding guidance scale are determined at each time step for guided sampling. Experiments on both class-conditioned and text-to-image generation diffusion models demonstrate that the proposed Gradient-free Classifier Guidance (GFCG) method consistently improves class prediction accuracy. We also show GFCG to be complementary to other guided sampling methods like CFG. When combined with the state-of-the-art Autoguidance (ATG), without additional computational overhead, it enhances image fidelity while preserving diversity. For ImageNet 512$\times$512, we achieve a record $\text{FD}_{\text{DINOv2}}$ of 23.09, while simultaneously attaining a higher classification Precision (94.3%) compared to ATG (90.2%)</p></details> |  |

However, these achievements have primarily depended on task-specific conditional training or error-prone heuristic approximations. Ideally, a conditional generation method should provide exact samples for a broad range of conditional distributions without requiring task-specific training. To this end, we introduce the Twisted Diffusion Sampler, or TDS. TDS is a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that targets the conditional distributions of diffusion models through simulating a set of weighted particles. The main idea is to use twisting, an SMC technique that enjoys good computational efficiency, to incorporate heuristic approximations without compromising asymptotic exactness. We first find in simulation and in conditional image generation tasks that TDS provides a computational statistical trade-off, yielding more accurate approximations with many particles but with empirical improvements over heuristics with as few as two particles. We then turn to motif-scaffolding, a core task in protein design, using a TDS extension to Riemannian diffusion models. On benchmark test cases, TDS allows flexible conditioning criteria and often outperforms the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/blt2114/twisted_diffusion_sampler</p></details> |

However, efficiently serving these models is challenging due to their computation-intensive nature and the variation in query demands. In this paper, we aim to address both problems simultaneously through query-aware model scaling. The core idea is to construct model cascades so that easy queries can be processed by more lightweight diffusion models without compromising image generation quality. Based on this concept, we develop an end-to-end text-to-image diffusion model serving system, DiffServe, which automatically constructs model cascades from available diffusion model variants and allocates resources dynamically in response to demand fluctuations. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that DiffServe achieves up to 24% improvement in response quality while maintaining 19-70% lower latency violation rates compared to state-of-the-art model serving systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Although some pioneering methods have achieved automatic text-to-3D generation, they are generally limited to small-scale scenes with restricted control over the shape and texture. We introduce SceneCraft, a novel method for generating detailed indoor scenes that adhere to textual descriptions and spatial layout preferences provided by users. Central to our method is a rendering-based technique, which converts 3D semantic layouts into multi-view 2D proxy maps. Furthermore, we design a semantic and depth conditioned diffusion model to generate multi-view images, which are used to learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the final scene representation. Without the constraints of panorama image generation, we surpass previous methods in supporting complicated indoor space generation beyond a single room, even as complicated as a whole multi-bedroom apartment with irregular shapes and layouts.

However, recent studies highlight concerns over the use of unauthorized data in training these models, which may lead to intellectual property infringement or privacy violations. A promising approach to mitigate these issues is to apply a watermark to images and subsequently check if generative models reproduce similar watermark features. In this paper, we examine the robustness of various watermark-based protection methods applied to text-to-image models. We observe that common image transformations are ineffective at removing the watermark effect. Therefore, we propose \tech{}, that leverages the diffusion process to conduct controlled image generation on the protected input, preserving the high-level features of the input while ignoring the low-level details utilized by watermarks. A small number of generated images are then used to fine-tune protected models. Our experiments on three datasets and 140 text-to-image diffusion models reveal that existing state-of-the-art protections are not robust against RATTAN.</p></details> |  |

Reducing the projection data in CT scans is often necessary to decrease radiation exposure, scanning time, and computational costs. However, this reduction makes accurate image reconstruction challenging due to the incomplete sinogram. Existing RGB inpainting models struggle with severe feature overlap, while current sinogram-specific models fail to employ efficient feature extraction methods that account for the physical principles underlying the sinogram generation process. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Frequency Convolution Diffusion Model (FCDM), a novel diffusion-based inpainting framework tailored for sinogram data. FCDM leverages frequency-domain convolutions to capture global and fine-grained structural features, effectively disentangling overlapping components across projection angles. Additionally, we propose a custom loss function that incorporates unique sinogram properties of total absorption consistency and frequency-domain consistency. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FCDM significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving SSIM over 0.95 and PSNR above 30 dB, with improvements of up to 33% in SSIM and 29% in PSNR compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging its capability for end-to-end autonomous driving is a promising direction. However, the numerous denoising steps in the robotic diffusion policy and the more dynamic, open-world nature of traffic scenes pose substantial challenges for generating diverse driving actions at a real-time speed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel truncated diffusion policy that incorporates prior multi-mode anchors and truncates the diffusion schedule, enabling the model to learn denoising from anchored Gaussian distribution to the multi-mode driving action distribution. Additionally, we design an efficient cascade diffusion decoder for enhanced interaction with conditional scene context. The proposed model, DiffusionDrive, demonstrates 10$\times$ reduction in denoising steps compared to vanilla diffusion policy, delivering superior diversity and quality in just 2 steps. On the planning-oriented NAVSIM dataset, with the aligned ResNet-34 backbone, DiffusionDrive achieves 88.1 PDMS without bells and whistles, setting a new record, while running at a real-time speed of 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090.

By employing a progressive material generation strategy guided by these confidence masks, along with a UV-space material refiner, our method ensures consistent, UV-ready material outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms existing methods across a wide range of object categories and lighting conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xhuangcv.github.io/MaterialAnything/</p></details> |

However, these models often generate videos that have misalignments with text prompts, especially when the prompts describe complex scenes with multiple objects and attributes. To address this, we introduce VideoRepair, a novel model-agnostic, training-free video refinement framework that automatically identifies fine-grained text-video misalignments and generates explicit spatial and textual feedback, enabling a T2V diffusion model to perform targeted, localized refinements. VideoRepair consists of four stages: In (1) video evaluation, we detect misalignments by generating fine-grained evaluation questions and answering those questions with MLLM. In (2) refinement planning, we identify accurately generated objects and then create localized prompts to refine other areas in the video. Next, in (3) region decomposition, we segment the correctly generated area using a combined grounding module. We regenerate the video by adjusting the misaligned regions while preserving the correct regions in (4) localized refinement. On two popular video generation benchmarks (EvalCrafter and T2V-CompBench), VideoRepair substantially outperforms recent baselines across various text-video alignment metrics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of VideoRepair components and qualitative examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-repair.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Frequency-Guided Posterior Sampling for Diffusion-Based Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15295v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from degraded observations. When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</p></details> |  |

In response, we gathered a diverse dataset named MedImgs, which comprises over 250,127 images spanning 61 disease types and 159 classes of both humans and animals from open-source repositories. We propose a Leapfrog Latent Consistency Model (LLCM) that is distilled from a retrained diffusion model based on the collected MedImgs dataset, which enables our model to generate real-time high-resolution images. We formulate the reverse diffusion process as a probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) and solve it in latent space using the Leapfrog algorithm. This formulation enables rapid sampling without necessitating additional iterations. Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in generating medical images. Furthermore, our model can be fine-tuned with any custom medical image datasets, facilitating the generation of a vast array of images. Our experimental results outperform those of existing models on unseen dog cardiac X-ray images.

| **[Controlling Language and Diffusion Models by Transporting Activations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23054v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing capabilities of large generative models and their ever more widespread deployment have raised concerns about their reliability, safety, and potential misuse. To address these issues, recent works have proposed to control model generation by steering model activations in order to effectively induce or prevent the emergence of concepts or behaviors in the generated output. In this paper we introduce Activation Transport (AcT), a general framework to steer activations guided by optimal transport theory that generalizes many previous activation-steering works. AcT is modality-agnostic and provides fine-grained control over the model behavior with negligible computational overhead, while minimally impacting model abilities. We experimentally show the effectiveness and versatility of our approach by addressing key challenges in large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models (T2Is). For LLMs, we show that AcT can effectively mitigate toxicity, induce arbitrary concepts, and increase their truthfulness. In T2Is, we show how AcT enables fine-grained style control and concept negation.</p></details> |  |
| **[FloAt: Flow Warping of Self-Attention for Clothing Animation Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15028v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a diffusion model-based approach, FloAtControlNet to generate cinemagraphs composed of animations of human clothing. We focus on human clothing like dresses, skirts and pants. The input to our model is a text prompt depicting the type of clothing and the texture of clothing like leopard, striped, or plain, and a sequence of normal maps that capture the underlying animation that we desire in the output. The backbone of our method is a normal-map conditioned ControlNet which is operated in a training-free regime. The key observation is that the underlying animation is embedded in the flow of the normal maps. We utilize the flow thus obtained to manipulate the self-attention maps of appropriate layers. Specifically, the self-attention maps of a particular layer and frame are recomputed as a linear combination of itself and the self-attention maps of the same layer and the previous frame, warped by the flow on the normal maps of the two frames. We show that manipulating the self-attention maps greatly enhances the quality of the clothing animation, making it look more natural as well as suppressing the background artifacts. Through extensive experiments, we show that the method proposed beats all baselines both qualitatively in terms of visual results and user study. Specifically, our method is able to alleviate the background flickering that exists in other diffusion model-based baselines that we consider. In addition, we show that our method beats all baselines in terms of RMSE and PSNR computed using the input normal map sequences and the normal map sequences obtained from the output RGB frames. Further, we show that well-established evaluation metrics like LPIPS, SSIM, and CLIP scores that are generally for visual quality are not necessarily suitable for capturing the subtle motions in human clothing animations.</p></details> |  |
| **[TDSM: Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching in Zero-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10745v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We firstly present a diffusion-based action recognition with zero-shot learning for skeleton inputs. In zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, aligning skeleton features with the text features of action labels is essential for accurately predicting unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment between skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these spaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated from the remarkable performance of text-to-image diffusion models, we leverage their alignment capabilities between different modalities mostly by focusing on the training process during reverse diffusion rather than using their generative power. Based on this, our framework is designed as a Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM) method which aligns skeleton features with text prompts through reverse diffusion, embedding the prompts into the unified skeleton-text latent space to achieve robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a novel triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing apart incorrect ones. Our TDSM significantly outperforms the very recent state-of-the-art methods with large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through effective skeleton-text matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at https://kaist-viclab.github.io/TDSM_site/</p></details> |
| **[LayoutDiT: Exploring Content-Graphic Balance in Layout Generation with Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15233v3)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Layout generation is a foundation task of graphic design, which requires the integration of visual aesthetics and harmonious expression of content delivery. However, existing methods still face challenges in generating precise and visually appealing layouts, including blocking, overlapping, small-sized, or spatial misalignment. We found that these methods overlook the crucial balance between learning content-aware and graphic-aware features. This oversight results in their limited ability to model the graphic structure of layouts and generate reasonable layout arrangements. To address these challenges, we introduce LayoutDiT, an effective framework that balances content and graphic features to generate high-quality, visually appealing layouts. Specifically, we first design an adaptive factor that optimizes the model's awareness of the layout generation space, balancing the model's performance in both content and graphic aspects. Secondly, we introduce a graphic condition, the saliency bounding box, to bridge the modality difference between images in the visual domain and layouts in the geometric parameter domain. In addition, we adapt a diffusion transformer model as the backbone, whose powerful generative capability ensures the quality of layout generation. Benefiting from the properties of diffusion models, our method excels in constrained settings without introducing additional constraint modules. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both constrained and unconstrained settings, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Exploration with Diffusion Policies in Hybrid Off-Policy RL: Application to Non-Prehensile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14913v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning diverse policies for non-prehensile manipulation is essential for improving skill transfer and generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios. In this work, we enhance exploration through a two-fold approach within a hybrid framework that tackles both discrete and continuous action spaces. First, we model the continuous motion parameter policy as a diffusion model, and second, we incorporate this into a maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework that unifies both the discrete and continuous components. The discrete action space, such as contact point selection, is optimized through Q-value function maximization, while the continuous part is guided by a diffusion-based policy. This hybrid approach leads to a principled objective, where the maximum entropy term is derived as a lower bound using structured variational inference. We propose the Hybrid Diffusion Policy algorithm (HyDo) and evaluate its performance on both simulation and zero-shot sim2real tasks. Our results show that HyDo encourages more diverse behavior policies, leading to significantly improved success rates across tasks - for example, increasing from 53% to 72% on a real-world 6D pose alignment task.

| **[EADReg: Probabilistic Correspondence Generation with Efficient Autoregressive Diffusion Model for Outdoor Point Cloud Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15271v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown the great potential in the point cloud registration (PCR) task, especially for enhancing the robustness to challenging cases. However, existing diffusion-based PCR methods primarily focus on instance-level scenarios and struggle with outdoor LiDAR points, where the sparsity, irregularity, and huge point scale inherent in LiDAR points pose challenges to establishing dense global point-to-point correspondences. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named EADReg for efficient and robust registration of LiDAR point clouds based on autoregressive diffusion models. EADReg follows a coarse-to-fine registration paradigm. In the coarse stage, we employ a Bi-directional Gaussian Mixture Model (BGMM) to reject outlier points and obtain purified point cloud pairs. BGMM establishes correspondences between the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) from the source and target frames, enabling reliable coarse registration based on filtered features and geometric information. In the fine stage, we treat diffusion-based PCR as an autoregressive process to generate robust point correspondences, which are then iteratively refined on upper layers. Despite common criticisms of diffusion-based methods regarding inference speed, EADReg achieves runtime comparable to convolutional-based methods. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and NuScenes benchmark datasets highlight the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method. Codes will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prioritize Denoising Steps on Diffusion Model Preference Alignment via Explicit Denoised Distribution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14871v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image generation, making alignment methods for these models increasingly important. A key challenge is the sparsity of preference labels, which are typically available only at the terminal of denoising trajectories. This raises the issue of how to assign credit across denoising steps based on these sparse labels. In this paper, we propose Denoised Distribution Estimation (DDE), a novel method for credit assignment. Unlike previous approaches that rely on auxiliary models or hand-crafted schemes, DDE derives its strategy more explicitly. The proposed DDE directly estimates the terminal denoised distribution from the perspective of each step. It is equipped with two estimation strategies and capable of representing the entire denoising trajectory with a single model inference. Theoretically and empirically, we show that DDE prioritizes optimizing the middle part of the denoising trajectory, resulting in a novel and effective credit assignment scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Schrodinger Bridge: Prompting Latent Diffusion for Fast Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14863v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs), which enable both image generation from noise and inversion from data, have inspired powerful unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation algorithms. However, they often require a larger number of neural function evaluations (NFEs), limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we tackle this problem with Schrodinger Bridges (SBs), which are stochastic differential equations (SDEs) between distributions with minimal transport cost. We analyze the probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) formulation of SBs, and observe that we can decompose its vector field into a linear combination of source predictor, target predictor, and noise predictor. Inspired by this observation, we propose Latent Schrodinger Bridges (LSBs) that approximate the SB ODE via pre-trained Stable Diffusion, and develop appropriate prompt optimization and change of variables formula to match the training and inference between distributions. We demonstrate that our algorithm successfully conduct competitive I2I translation in unsupervised setting with only a fraction of computation cost required by previous DM-based I2I methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Derivative-Free Diffusion Manifold-Constrained Gradient for Unified XAI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15265v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-based methods are a prototypical family of explainability techniques, especially for image-based models. Nonetheless, they have several shortcomings in that they (1) require white-box access to models, (2) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and (3) produce attributions that lie off the image manifold, leading to explanations that are not actually faithful to the model and do not align well with human perception. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Derivative-Free Diffusion Manifold-Constrainted Gradients (FreeMCG), a novel method that serves as an improved basis for explainability of a given neural network than the traditional gradient. Specifically, by leveraging ensemble Kalman filters and diffusion models, we derive a derivative-free approximation of the model's gradient projected onto the data manifold, requiring access only to the model's outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FreeMCG by applying it to both counterfactual generation and feature attribution, which have traditionally been treated as distinct tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on both tasks, counterfactual explanation and feature attribution, we show that our method yields state-of-the-art results while preserving the essential properties expected of XAI tools.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Recent methods model virtual try-on as image mask-inpaint task, which requires masking the person image and results in significant loss of spatial information. Especially, for in-the-wild try-on scenarios with complex poses and occlusions, mask-based methods often introduce noticeable artifacts. Our research found that a mask-free approach can fully leverage spatial and lighting information from the original person image, enabling high-quality virtual try-on. Consequently, we propose a novel training paradigm for a mask-free try-on diffusion model. We ensure the model's mask-free try-on capability by creating high-quality pseudo-data and further enhance its handling of complex spatial information through effective in-the-wild data augmentation. Besides, a try-on localization loss is designed to concentrate on try-on area while suppressing garment features in non-try-on areas, ensuring precise rendering of garments and preservation of fore/back-ground. In the end, we introduce BooW-VTON, the mask-free virtual try-on diffusion model, which delivers SOTA try-on quality without parsing cost. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated superior performance in wild scenarios with such a low-demand input.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Text to Pose to Image: Improving Diffusion Model Control and Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12872v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last two years, text-to-image diffusion models have become extremely popular. As their quality and usage increase, a major concern has been the need for better output control. In addition to prompt engineering, one effective method to improve the controllability of diffusion models has been to condition them on additional modalities such as image style, depth map, or keypoints. This forms the basis of ControlNets or Adapters. When attempting to apply these methods to control human poses in outputs of text-to-image diffusion models, two main challenges have arisen. The first challenge is generating poses following a wide range of semantic text descriptions, for which previous methods involved searching for a pose within a dataset of (caption, pose) pairs. The second challenge is conditioning image generation on a specified pose while keeping both high aesthetic and high pose fidelity. In this article, we fix these two main issues by introducing a text-to-pose (T2P) generative model alongside a new sampling algorithm, and a new pose adapter that incorporates more pose keypoints for higher pose fidelity. Together, these two new state-of-the-art models enable, for the first time, a generative text-to-pose-to-image framework for higher pose control in diffusion models. We release all models and the code used for the experiments at https://github.com/clement-bonnet/text-to-pose.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Compositional Learning: Perspectives, Methods, and Paths Forward</p></details> |

However, previous studies on 3D CT generation have yet to fully capitalize on semantic and textual conditions, and they have primarily focused on specific organs characterized by a local structure and fixed contrast. In this work, we present GuideGen, a controllable framework that generates anatomical masks and corresponding CT volumes for the entire torso-from chest to pelvis-based on free-form text prompts. Our approach includes three core components: a text-conditional semantic synthesizer for creating realistic full-torso anatomies; a contrast-aware autoencoder for detailed, high-fidelity feature extraction across varying contrast levels; and a latent feature generator that ensures alignment between CT images, anatomical semantics and input prompts. To train and evaluate GuideGen, we compile a multi-modality cancer imaging dataset with paired CT and clinical descriptions from 12 public TCIA datasets and one private real-world dataset. Comprehensive evaluations across generation quality, cross-modality alignment, and data usability on multi-organ and tumor segmentation tasks demonstrate GuideGen's superiority over existing CT generation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to CVPR2025</p></details> |

Recently, frequency domain-based methods have achieved impressive improvement, yet they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios under extreme exposure conditions. This is due to the local convolutional receptive fields failing to model long-range dependencies in the spectrum, and the non-generative learning paradigm being inadequate for retrieving lost details from severely degraded regions. In this paper, we propose Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba (OSMamba), a novel exposure correction network that incorporates the advantages of state space models and generative diffusion models to address these limitations. Specifically, OSMamba introduces an omnidirectional spectral scanning mechanism that adapts Mamba to the frequency domain to capture comprehensive long-range dependencies in both the amplitude and phase spectra of deep image features, hence enhancing illumination correction and structure recovery. Furthermore, we develop a dual-domain prior generator that learns from well-exposed images to generate a degradation-free diffusion prior containing correct information about severely under- and over-exposed regions for better detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple-exposure and mixed-exposure datasets demonstrate that the proposed OSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

However, the challenge of personalized, controllable generation of instances within these images remains an area in need of further development. In this paper, we present LocRef-Diffusion, a novel, tuning-free model capable of personalized customization of multiple instances' appearance and position within an image. To enhance the precision of instance placement, we introduce a Layout-net, which controls instance generation locations by leveraging both explicit instance layout information and an instance region cross-attention module. To improve the appearance fidelity to reference images, we employ an appearance-net that extracts instance appearance features and integrates them into the diffusion model through cross-attention mechanisms. We conducted extensive experiments on the COCO and OpenImages datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout and appearance guided generation.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning with reference images is the most promising approach, but it often blindly utilizes objectives and noise level distributions used for pre-training, leading to suboptimal style alignment. We propose the Style-friendly SNR sampler, which aggressively shifts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution toward higher noise levels during fine-tuning to focus on noise levels where stylistic features emerge. This enables models to better capture unique styles and generate images with higher style alignment. Our method allows diffusion models to learn and share new "style templates", enhancing personalized content creation. We demonstrate the ability to generate styles such as personal watercolor paintings, minimal flat cartoons, 3D renderings, multi-panel images, and memes with text, thereby broadening the scope of style-driven generation.</p></details> |  |

Prior approaches often employ computationally intensive two-stage approaches, which first generate an intermediate representation, such as contact maps, followed by an iterative optimization procedure that updates hand meshes to capture the hand-object relation. However, due to the high computation complexity during the optimization stage, such strategies often suffer from low efficiency in inference. To address this limitation, this work introduces a novel diffusion-model-based approach that generates the grasping pose in a one-stage manner. This allows us to significantly improve generation speed and the diversity of generated hand poses. In particular, we develop a Latent Diffusion Model with an Adaptation Module for object-conditioned hand pose generation and a contact-aware loss to enforce the physical constraints between hands and objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster inference, higher diversity, and superior pose quality than state-of-the-art approaches.

However, applying existing RL methods to timestep-distilled DMs is challenging for ultra-fast ($\le2$-step) image generation. Our analysis suggests several limitations of policy-based RL methods such as PPO or DPO toward this goal. Based on the insights, we propose fine-tuning DMs with learned differentiable surrogate rewards. Our method, named LaSRO, learns surrogate reward models in the latent space of SDXL to convert arbitrary rewards into differentiable ones for efficient reward gradient guidance. LaSRO leverages pre-trained latent DMs for reward modeling and specifically targets image generation $\le2$ steps for reward optimization, enhancing generalizability and efficiency. LaSRO is effective and stable for improving ultra-fast image generation with different reward objectives, outperforming popular RL methods including PPO and DPO. We further show LaSRO's connection to value-based RL, providing theoretical insights. See our webpage at https://sites.google.com/view/lasro.</p></details> |  |

However, diffusion processes are prone to generating samples that reflect biases in a training dataset. To address this issue, we develop constrained diffusion models by imposing diffusion constraints based on desired distributions that are informed by requirements. Specifically, we cast the training of diffusion models under requirements as a constrained distribution optimization problem that aims to reduce the distribution difference between original and generated data while obeying constraints on the distribution of generated data. We show that our constrained diffusion models generate new data from a mixture data distribution that achieves the optimal trade-off among objective and constraints. To train constrained diffusion models, we develop a dual training algorithm and characterize the optimality of the trained constrained diffusion model. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our constrained models in two constrained generation tasks: (i) we consider a dataset with one or more underrepresented classes where we train the model with constraints to ensure fairly sampling from all classes during inference; (ii) we fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model to sample from a new dataset while avoiding overfitting.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) driving scenarios is essential for enhancing safety, as OOD scenarios help validate the reliability of the models within the vehicle's autonomy stack. However, generating OOD scenarios is challenging due to their long-tailed distribution and rarity in urban driving dataset. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in autonomous driving, particularly for their zero-shot generalization and common-sense reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we leverage these LLM strengths to introduce a framework for generating diverse OOD driving scenarios. Our approach uses LLMs to construct a branching tree, where each branch represents a unique OOD scenario. These scenarios are then simulated in the CARLA simulator using an automated framework that aligns scene augmentation with the corresponding textual descriptions. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulations, and assess its performance via a diversity metric that measures the richness of the scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a new "OOD-ness" metric, which quantifies how much the generated scenarios deviate from typical urban driving conditions. Furthermore, we explore the capacity of modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and safely navigate through the simulated OOD scenarios. Our findings offer valuable insights into the reliability of language models in addressing OOD scenarios within the context of urban driving.</p></details> |  |

This foundational skill enables robots not only to perceive their surroundings but also to reason about and interact meaningfully within the world. In modern robotics, these capabilities are taken on by visual language models, and they face significant challenges when applied to spatial reasoning context due to their training data sources. These sources utilize general-purpose image datasets, and they often lack sophisticated spatial scene understanding capabilities. For example, the datasets do not address reference frame comprehension - spatial relationships require clear contextual understanding, whether from an ego-centric, object-centric, or world-centric perspective, which allow for effective real-world interaction. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale spatial understanding dataset consisting of real indoor and tabletop scenes captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5K 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, with paired 2D egocentric images and 3D scans to make it both 2D and 3D ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robotics manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Optimizing the initial noisy latent offers a more efficient alternative to modifying model architectures or prompt engineering for improving semantic alignment. A latest approach, InitNo, refines the initial noisy latent by leveraging attention maps; however, these maps capture only limited information, and the effectiveness of InitNo is highly dependent on the initial starting point, as it tends to converge on a local optimum near this point. To this end, this paper proposes leveraging the language comprehension capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to guide the optimization of the initial noisy latent, and introduces the Noise Diffusion process, which updates the noisy latent to generate semantically faithful images while preserving distribution consistency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the condition under which the update improves semantic faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our framework, consistently enhancing semantic alignment across various diffusion models.

Guided by a pre-design user study with PVIs, our benchmark includes the five most crucial vision-language tasks: Panoptic Segmentation, Depth Estimation, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Image Captioning, and Visual Question Answering (VQA). Besides, we propose a novel AT model (@Model) that addresses all tasks simultaneously and can be expanded to more assistive functions for helping PVIs. Our framework exhibits outstanding performance across tasks by integrating multi-modal information, and it offers PVIs a more comprehensive assistance.

Semantic segmentation for autonomous driving faces a wide range of domain shifts, e.g. caused by changing weather conditions, new geolocations and the frequent use of synthetic data in model training. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have emerged which adapt a model to a new target domain by only using unlabeled data of that domain. The variety of UDA methods is large but all of them use ImageNet pre-trained models. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities which may facilitate domain adaptation. We show that simply replacing the encoder of existing UDA methods like DACS by a vision-language pre-trained encoder can result in significant performance improvements of up to 10.0% mIoU on the GTA5-to-Cityscapes domain shift. For the generalization performance to unseen domains, the newly employed vision-language pre-trained encoder provides a gain of up to 13.7% mIoU across three unseen datasets. However, we find that not all UDA methods can be easily paired with the new encoder and that the UDA performance does not always likewise transfer into generalization performance. Finally, we perform our experiments on an adverse weather condition domain shift to further verify our findings on a pure real-to-real domain shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) 2024: Workshop on Robust Recognition in the Open World (RROW)</p></details> |

However, the demanding hardware requirements of high-resolution IR sensors limit its widespread application. As an alternative, visible light can be used to synthesize IR images but this causes a loss of fidelity in image details and introduces inconsistencies due to lack of contextual awareness of the scene. This stems from a combination of using visible light with a standard dynamic range, especially under extreme lighting, and a lack of contextual awareness can result in pseudo-thermal-crossover artifacts. This occurs when multiple objects with similar temperatures appear indistinguishable in the training data, further exacerbating the loss of fidelity. To solve this challenge, this paper proposes CapHDR2IR, a novel framework incorporating vision-language models using high dynamic range (HDR) images as inputs to generate IR images. HDR images capture a wider range of luminance variations, ensuring reliable IR image generation in different light conditions. Additionally, a dense caption branch integrates semantic understanding, resulting in more meaningful and discernible IR outputs. Extensive experiments on the HDRT dataset show that the proposed CapHDR2IR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing general domain transfer methods and those tailored for visible-to-infrared image translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[FTII-Bench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Benchmark for Flow Text with Image Insertion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12564v2)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from the revolutionary advances in large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision models, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have also made significant progress. However, current benchmarks focus on tasks that evaluating only a single aspect of LVLM capabilities (e.g., recognition, detection, understanding). These tasks fail to fully demonstrate LVLMs' potential in complex application scenarios. To comprehensively assess the performance of existing LVLMs, we propose a more challenging task called the Flow Text with Image Insertion task (FTII). This task requires LVLMs to simultaneously possess outstanding abilities in image comprehension, instruction understanding, and long-text interpretation. Specifically, given several text paragraphs and a set of candidate images, as the text paragraphs accumulate, the LVLMs are required to select the most suitable image from the candidates to insert after the corresponding paragraph. Constructing a benchmark for such a task is highly challenging, particularly in determining the sequence of flowing text and images. To address this challenge, we turn to professional news reports, which naturally contain a gold standard for image-text sequences. Based on this, we introduce the Flow Text with Image Insertion Benchmark (FTII-Bench), which includes 318 high-quality Chinese image-text news articles and 307 high-quality English image-text news articles, covering 10 different news domains. Using these 625 high-quality articles, we construct problems of two different types with multiple levels of difficulty. Furthermore, we establish two different evaluation pipelines based on the CLIP model and existing LVLMs. We evaluate 9 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs as well as 2 CLIP-based models. Results indicate that even the most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4o) face significant challenges when tackling the FTII task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress. 9 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

Recent works leverage pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) for object segmentation and project them to point clouds to build 3D maps. Despite progress, a point cloud is a set of unordered coordinates that requires substantial storage space and does not directly convey occupancy information or spatial relation, making existing methods inefficient for downstream tasks, e.g., path planning and complex text-based object retrieval. To address these issues, we propose Octree-Graph, a novel scene representation for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. Specifically, a Chronological Group-wise Segment Merging (CGSM) strategy and an Instance Feature Aggregation (IFA) algorithm are first designed to get 3D instances and corresponding semantic features. Subsequently, an adaptive-octree structure is developed that stores semantics and depicts the occupancy of an object adjustably according to its shape. Finally, the Octree-Graph is constructed where each adaptive-octree acts as a graph node, and edges describe the spatial relations among nodes. Extensive experiments on various tasks are conducted on several widely-used datasets, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | 11pages,7figures |

While prompt learning has emerged as an effective strategy to adapt pre-trained VL models for downstream tasks, current approaches frequently encounter severe overfitting to specific downstream data distributions. This overfitting constrains the original behavior of the VL models to generalize to new domains or unseen classes, posing a critical challenge in enhancing the adaptability and generalization of VL models. To address this limitation, we propose Style-Pro, a novel style-guided prompt learning framework that mitigates overfitting and preserves the zero-shot generalization capabilities of CLIP. Style-Pro employs learnable style bases to synthesize diverse distribution shifts, guided by two specialized loss functions that ensure style diversity and content integrity. Then, to minimize discrepancies between unseen domains and the source domain, Style-Pro maps the unseen styles into the known style representation space as a weighted combination of style bases. Moreover, to maintain consistency between the style-shifted prompted model and the original frozen CLIP, Style-Pro introduces consistency constraints to preserve alignment in the learned embeddings, minimizing deviation during adaptation to downstream tasks. Extensive experiments across 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Style-Pro, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods in various settings, including base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset transfer, and domain generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV 2025)</p></details> |

We adapt several state-of-the-art pre-trained generative models to address this task, including 2D and 3D diffusion models and vision-language models, and show that they can be used to infer the presence of objects that are not directly observed. To benchmark this task, we propose a suite of metrics that capture different aspects of performance.

| **[Self-Calibrated CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15869v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP, have enabled the task of open-vocabulary segmentation. CLIP demonstrates impressive zero-shot capabilities in various downstream tasks that require holistic image understanding. However, due to its image-level pre-training, CLIP struggles to capture local details, resulting in poor performance in segmentation tasks. Our analysis reveals that anomaly tokens emerge during the forward pass, drawing excessive attention from normal patch tokens, thereby diminishing spatial awareness. To address this issue, we propose Self-Calibrated CLIP (SC-CLIP), a training-free method that calibrates CLIP to produce finer-grained representations while preserving its original generalization ability, without introducing new parameters or relying on additional backbones. Specifically, we first identify and resolve the anomaly tokens to mitigate their negative impact. Next, we enhance feature discriminability and attention correlation by leveraging the semantic consistency found in CLIP's intermediate features. Furthermore, we employ multi-level feature fusion to enrich details. Collectively, these strategies enhance CLIP's feature representation with greater granularity and coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-CLIP, achieving state-of-the-art results across eight semantic segmentation datasets and surpassing previous methods by 9.5%. Notably, SC-CLIP boosts the performance of vanilla CLIP ViT-L/14 by 6.8 times. Our source code is available at https://github.com/SuleBai/SC-CLIP.</p></details> |  |

Recent works often attribute such deficiency in dense predictions to the self-attention layers in the final block, and have achieved commendable results by modifying the original query-key attention to self-correlation attention, (e.g., query-query and key-key attention). However, these methods overlook the cross-correlation attention (query-key) properties, which capture the rich spatial correspondence. In this paper, we reveal that the cross-correlation of the self-attention in CLIP's non-final layers also exhibits localization properties. Therefore, we propose the Residual Cross-correlation Self-attention (RCS) module, which leverages the cross-correlation self-attention from intermediate layers to remold the attention in the final block. The RCS module effectively reorganizes spatial information, unleashing the localization potential within CLIP for dense vision-language inference. Furthermore, to enhance the focus on regions of the same categories and local consistency, we propose the Semantic Feedback Refinement (SFR) module, which utilizes semantic segmentation maps to further adjust the attention scores. By integrating these two strategies, our method, termed ResCLIP, can be easily incorporated into existing approaches as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosting their performance in dense vision-language inference. Extensive experiments across multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, they often generate responses that appear plausible yet do not accurately reflect the visual content, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Recent approaches have introduced training-free methods that mitigate hallucinations by adjusting the decoding strategy during inference stage, typically attributing hallucination to the language model itself. Our analysis, however, reveals that distortions in the visual encoding process significantly affect the model's reasoning accuracy. Specifically, earlier visual layers may retain key features but gradually distort as the information propagates toward the output layer. Building on these findings, we propose a novel hallucination-mitigation method from the visual encoding perspective: \textbf{V}isu\textbf{a}l \textbf{L}ayer Fus\textbf{i}on Contrastive \textbf{D}ecoding (VaLiD). This method utilizes uncertainty to guide the selection of visual hidden layers, correcting distortions in the visual encoding process and thereby improving the reliability of generated text. Experimental results show that VaLiD effectively reduces hallucinations across various benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to multiple baseline methods.</p></details> | 15 pages |

While prior methods have shown effectiveness in addressing distribution shift by adjusting classification logits, they are not optimal due to keeping text features unchanged. To address this issue, we introduce a new approach called Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter (TAEA), which trains an adapter with test samples to adjust text features during the test phase. We can enhance the text-to-image alignment prediction by utilizing an adapter to adapt text features. Furthermore, we also propose to adopt the negative cache from TDA as enhancement module, which further improves the performance of TAEA. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art TTA method of pre-trained VLMs by an average of 0.75% on the out-of-distribution benchmark and 2.5% on the cross-domain benchmark, with an acceptable training time.

As the practical applications of vision-language models become increasingly widespread, their potential safety and robustness issues raise concerns that adversaries may evade the system and cause these models to generate toxic content through malicious attacks. Therefore, evaluating the robustness of open-source VLMs against adversarial attacks has garnered growing attention, with transfer-based attacks as a representative black-box attacking strategy. However, most existing transfer-based attacks neglect the importance of the semantic correlations between vision and text modalities, leading to sub-optimal adversarial example generation and attack performance. To address this issue, we present Chain of Attack (CoA), which iteratively enhances the generation of adversarial examples based on the multi-modal semantic update using a series of intermediate attacking steps, achieving superior adversarial transferability and efficiency. A unified attack success rate computing method is further proposed for automatic evasion evaluation. Extensive experiments conducted under the most realistic and high-stakes scenario, demonstrate that our attacking strategy can effectively mislead models to generate targeted responses using only black-box attacks without any knowledge of the victim models. The comprehensive robustness evaluation in our paper provides insight into the vulnerabilities of VLMs and offers a reference for the safety considerations of future model developments.</p></details> |  |

However, with the increasing integration of visual data, privacy concerns in Vision Language Models (VLMs) remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce Facial Identity Unlearning Benchmark (FIUBench), a novel VLM unlearning benchmark designed to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning algorithms under the Right to be Forgotten setting. Specifically, we formulate the VLM unlearning task via constructing the Fictitious Facial Identity VQA dataset and apply a two-stage evaluation pipeline that is designed to precisely control the sources of information and their exposure levels. In terms of evaluation, since VLM supports various forms of ways to ask questions with the same semantic meaning, we also provide robust evaluation metrics including membership inference attacks and carefully designed adversarial privacy attacks to evaluate the performance of algorithms. Through the evaluation of four baseline VLM unlearning algorithms within FIUBench, we find that all methods remain limited in their unlearning performance, with significant trade-offs between model utility and forget quality. Furthermore, our findings also highlight the importance of privacy attacks for robust evaluations. We hope FIUBench will drive progress in developing more effective VLM unlearning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI.

Improving this capability requires high-quality vision-language data, which is costly and labor-intensive to acquire. Self-training approaches have been effective in single-modal settings to alleviate the need for labeled data by leveraging model's own generation. However, effective self-training remains a challenge regarding the unique visual perception and reasoning capability of LVLMs. To address this, we introduce Self-Training on Image Comprehension (STIC), which emphasizes a self-training approach specifically for image comprehension. First, the model self-constructs a preference dataset for image descriptions using unlabeled images. Preferred responses are generated through a step-by-step prompt, while dis-preferred responses are generated from either corrupted images or misleading prompts. To further self-improve reasoning on the extracted visual information, we let the model reuse a small portion of existing instruction-tuning data and append its self-generated image descriptions to the prompts. We validate the effectiveness of STIC across seven different benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains of 4.0% on average while using 70% less supervised fine-tuning data than the current method. Further studies investigate various components of STIC and highlight its potential to leverage vast quantities of unlabeled images for self-training.

We develop methods to solve FSR by leveraging a pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM). We particularly explore retrieval-augmented learning (RAL), which retrieves data from the VLM's pretraining set to learn better models for serving downstream tasks. RAL has been widely studied in zero-shot recognition but remains under-explored in FSR. Although applying RAL to FSR may seem straightforward, we observe interesting and novel challenges and opportunities. First, somewhat surprisingly, finetuning a VLM on a large amount of retrieved data underperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods. This is due to the imbalanced distribution of retrieved data and its domain gaps with the few-shot examples in the downstream task. Second, more surprisingly, we find that simply finetuning a VLM solely on few-shot examples significantly outperforms previous FSR methods, and finetuning on the mix of retrieved and few-shot data yields even better results. Third, to mitigate the imbalanced distribution and domain gap issues, we propose Stage-Wise retrieval-Augmented fineTuning (SWAT), which involves end-to-end finetuning on mixed data in the first stage and retraining the classifier on the few-shot data in the second stage. Extensive experiments on nine popular benchmarks demonstrate that SWAT significantly outperforms previous methods by $>$6% accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tian1327.github.io/SWAT/</p></details> |

However, the use of large-scale datasets scraped from the web for training also makes these models vulnerable to potential security threats, such as backdooring and poisoning attacks. In this paper, we propose a method for mitigating such attacks on contrastively trained vision-language models. Our approach leverages external knowledge extracted from a language model to prevent models from learning correlations between image regions which lack strong alignment with external knowledge. We do this by imposing constraints to enforce that attention paid by the model to visual regions is proportional to the alignment of those regions with external knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments using a variety of recent backdooring and poisoning attacks on multiple datasets and architectures. Our results clearly demonstrate that our proposed approach is highly effective at defending against such attacks across multiple settings, while maintaining model utility and without requiring any changes at inference time</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

However, existing VLMs lack intrinsic understanding of procedural action concepts. Hence, they overfit to fixed labels and are not invariant to unseen action synonyms. To address this, we propose a simple fine-tuning technique, Action Concept Enhancement (ACE), to improve the robustness and concept understanding of VLMs in procedural action classification. ACE continually incorporates augmented action synonyms and negatives in an auxiliary classification loss by stochastically replacing fixed labels during training. This creates new combinations of action labels over the course of fine-tuning and prevents overfitting to fixed action representations. We show the enhanced concept understanding of our VLM, by visualizing the alignment of encoded embeddings of unseen action synonyms in the embedding space. Our experiments on the ATA, IKEA and GTEA datasets demonstrate the efficacy of ACE in domains of cooking and assembly leading to significant improvements in zero-shot action classification while maintaining competitive performance on seen actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |

However, existing VLMs struggle with long videos due to computational inefficiency, memory limitations, and difficulties in maintaining coherent understanding across extended sequences. To address these challenges, we introduce ReWind, a novel memory-based VLM designed for efficient long video understanding while preserving temporal fidelity. ReWind operates in a two-stage framework. In the first stage, ReWind maintains a dynamic learnable memory module with a novel \textbf{read-perceive-write} cycle that stores and updates instruction-relevant visual information as the video unfolds. This module utilizes learnable queries and cross-attentions between memory contents and the input stream, ensuring low memory requirements by scaling linearly with the number of tokens. In the second stage, we propose an adaptive frame selection mechanism guided by the memory content to identify instruction-relevant key moments. It enriches the memory representations with detailed spatial information by selecting a few high-resolution frames, which are then combined with the memory contents and fed into a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the final answer. We empirically demonstrate ReWind's superior performance in visual question answering (VQA) and temporal grounding tasks, surpassing previous methods on long video benchmarks. Notably, ReWind achieves a +13\% score gain and a +12\% accuracy improvement on the MovieChat-1K VQA dataset and an +8\% mIoU increase on Charades-STA for temporal grounding.</p></details> |  |
| **[MUNBa: Machine Unlearning via Nash Bargaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15537v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from models while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto front, effectively avoiding the gradient conflicts. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving superior performance on several benchmarks. For example, in the challenging scenario of sample-wise forgetting, our algorithm approaches the gold standard retrain baseline. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong Knowledge Editing for Vision Language Models with Low-Rank Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15432v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to correct inaccurate knowledge, update outdated information, and incorporate new data into Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for retraining. This task poses challenges in lifelong scenarios where edits must be continuously applied for real-world applications. While some editors demonstrate strong robustness for lifelong editing in pure LLMs, Vision LLMs (VLLMs), which incorporate an additional vision modality, are not directly adaptable to existing LLM editors. In this paper, we propose LiveEdit, a LIfelong Vision language modEl Edit to bridge the gap between lifelong LLM editing and VLLMs. We begin by training an editing expert generator to independently produce low-rank experts for each editing instance, with the goal of correcting the relevant responses of the VLLM. A hard filtering mechanism is developed to utilize visual semantic knowledge, thereby coarsely eliminating visually irrelevant experts for input queries during the inference stage of the post-edited model. Finally, to integrate visually relevant experts, we introduce a soft routing mechanism based on textual semantic relevance to achieve multi-expert fusion. For evaluation, we establish a benchmark for lifelong VLLM editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveEdit offers significant advantages in lifelong VLLM editing scenarios. Further experiments validate the rationality and effectiveness of each module design in LiveEdit.</p></details> |  |

Despite their superior capabilities, VLMs struggle with fine-grained image regional composition information perception. Specifically, they have difficulty accurately aligning the segmentation masks with the corresponding semantics and precisely describing the compositional aspects of the referred regions. However, compositionality - the ability to understand and generate novel combinations of known visual and textual components - is critical for facilitating coherent reasoning and understanding across modalities by VLMs. To address this issue, we propose FINECAPTION, a novel VLM that can recognize arbitrary masks as referential inputs and process high-resolution images for compositional image captioning at different granularity levels. To support this endeavor, we introduce COMPOSITIONCAP, a new dataset for multi-grained region compositional image captioning, which introduces the task of compositional attribute-aware regional image captioning. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to other state-of-the-art VLMs. Additionally, we analyze the capabilities of current VLMs in recognizing various visual prompts for compositional region image captioning, highlighting areas for improvement in VLM design and training.</p></details> | Preprint |

Yet the standard pretraining paradigm (contrastive learning on large amounts of image-text data) does not explicitly encourage representations to support few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose a simple, but carefully designed extension to multimodal pretraining which enables representations to accommodate additional context. Using this objective, we show that vision-language models can be trained to exhibit significantly increased few-shot adaptation: across 21 downstream tasks, we find up to four-fold improvements in test-time sample efficiency, and average few-shot adaptation gains of over 5%, while retaining zero-shot generalization performance across model scales and training durations. In particular, equipped with simple, training-free, metric-based adaptation mechanisms, our representations easily surpass more complex and expensive optimization-based schemes, vastly simplifying generalization to new domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geminio: Language-Guided Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14937v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models that bridge vision and language have made significant progress, inspiring numerous life-enriching applications. However, their potential for misuse to introduce new threats remains largely unexplored. This paper reveals that vision-language models (VLMs) can be exploited to overcome longstanding limitations in gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) within federated learning (FL), where an FL server reconstructs private data samples from gradients shared by victim clients. Current GIAs face challenges in reconstructing high-resolution images, especially when the victim has a large local data batch. While focusing reconstruction on valuable samples rather than the entire batch is promising, existing methods lack the flexibility to allow attackers to specify their target data. In this paper, we introduce Geminio, the first approach to transform GIAs into semantically meaningful, targeted attacks. Geminio enables a brand new privacy attack experience: attackers can describe, in natural language, the types of data they consider valuable, and Geminio will prioritize reconstruction to focus on those high-value samples. This is achieved by leveraging a pretrained VLM to guide the optimization of a malicious global model that, when shared with and optimized by a victim, retains only gradients of samples that match the attacker-specified query. Extensive experiments demonstrate Geminio's effectiveness in pinpointing and reconstructing targeted samples, with high success rates across complex datasets under FL and large batch sizes and showing resilience against existing defenses.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, these VLMs are constrained by frame limitations, often losing essential temporal details needed for accurate event localization in extended video content. We propose ReVisionLLM, a recursive vision-language model designed to locate events in hour-long videos. Inspired by human search strategies, our model initially targets broad segments of interest, progressively revising its focus to pinpoint exact temporal boundaries. Our model can seamlessly handle videos of vastly different lengths, from minutes to hours. We also introduce a hierarchical training strategy that starts with short clips to capture distinct events and progressively extends to longer videos. To our knowledge, ReVisionLLM is the first VLM capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets by a significant margin (+2.6% R1@0.1 on MAD). The code is available at https://github.com/Tanveer81/ReVisionLLM.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically either fine-tune the LVLMs using additional data, which incurs extra costs in manual annotation and computational resources or perform comparisons at the decoding stage, which may eliminate useful language priors for reasoning while introducing inference time overhead. Therefore, we propose ICT, a lightweight, training-free method that calculates an intervention direction to shift the model's focus towards different levels of visual information, enhancing its attention to high-level and fine-grained visual details. During the forward pass stage, the intervention is applied to the attention heads that encode the overall image information and the fine-grained object details, effectively mitigating the phenomenon of overly language priors, and thereby alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICT achieves strong performance with a small amount of data and generalizes well across different datasets and models. Our code will be public.</p></details> |  |

These models are increasingly capable of tackling abstract visual tasks. Geometric structures, particularly graphs with their inherent flexibility and complexity, serve as an excellent benchmark for evaluating these models' predictive capabilities. While human observers can readily identify subtle visual details and perform accurate analyses, our investigation reveals that state-of-the-art LVLMs exhibit consistent limitations in specific visual graph scenarios, especially when confronted with stylistic variations. In response to these challenges, we introduce VisGraphVar (Visual Graph Variability), a customizable benchmark generator able to produce graph images for seven distinct task categories (detection, classification, segmentation, pattern recognition, link prediction, reasoning, matching), designed to systematically evaluate the strengths and limitations of individual LVLMs. We use VisGraphVar to produce 990 graph images and evaluate six LVLMs, employing two distinct prompting strategies, namely zero-shot and chain-of-thought. The findings demonstrate that variations in visual attributes of images (e.g., node labeling and layout) and the deliberate inclusion of visual imperfections, such as overlapping nodes, significantly affect model performance. This research emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive evaluation across graph-related tasks, extending beyond reasoning alone. VisGraphVar offers valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable and robust systems capable of performing advanced visual graph analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14797v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models.</p></details> |  |

Existing video question-answering (VideoQA) datasets often rely on costly manual annotations with insufficient granularity or automatic construction methods with redundant frame-by-frame analysis, limiting their scalability and effectiveness for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoEspresso, a novel dataset that features VideoQA pairs preserving essential spatial details and temporal coherence, along with multimodal annotations of intermediate reasoning steps. Our construction pipeline employs a semantic-aware method to reduce redundancy, followed by generating QA pairs using GPT-4o. We further develop video Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations to enrich reasoning processes, guiding GPT-4o in extracting logical relationships from QA pairs and video content. To exploit the potential of high-quality VideoQA pairs, we propose a Hybrid LVLMs Collaboration framework, featuring a Frame Selector and a two-stage instruction fine-tuned reasoning LVLM. This framework adaptively selects core frames and performs CoT reasoning using multimodal evidence. Evaluated on our proposed benchmark with 14 tasks against 9 popular LVLMs, our method outperforms existing baselines on most tasks, demonstrating superior video reasoning capabilities. Our code and dataset will be released at: https://github.com/hshjerry/VideoEspresso</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the trajectory into a generalized program of thoughts by correcting inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These programs of thought are iteratively improved through human feedback while the agent executes the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting examples significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent's library of examples grows, it becomes more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the SOTA in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over few-shot GPT4V. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such programs of thought.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |

Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness across challenging conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Prompt Distillation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15244v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their deployment in safety-critical scenarios like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. One promising approach for improving the robustness of pre-trained VLMs is Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), which combines adversarial training with prompt tuning. However, existing APT methods are mostly single-modal methods that design prompt(s) for only the visual or textual modality, limiting their effectiveness in either robustness or clean accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel method called Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD) that combines APT with knowledge distillation to boost the adversarial robustness of CLIP. Specifically, APD is a bimodal method that adds prompts for both the visual and textual modalities while leveraging a cleanly pre-trained teacher CLIP model to distill and boost the performance of the student CLIP model on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our APD over the current state-of-the-art APT methods in terms of both natural and adversarial performances. The effectiveness of our APD method validates the possibility of using a non-robust teacher to improve the generalization and robustness of VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies rely upon self-report or manual measures from bulky wearable sensors, thus lacking efficiency and accuracy in capturing quantitative screen exposure data. In this work, we developed a novel sensor informatics framework that utilizes egocentric images from a wearable sensor, termed the screen time tracker (STT), and a vision language model (VLM). In particular, we devised a multi-view VLM that takes multiple views from egocentric image sequences and interprets screen exposure dynamically. We validated our approach by using a dataset of children's free-living activities, demonstrating significant improvement over existing methods in plain vision language models and object detection models. Results supported the promise of this monitoring approach, which could optimize behavioral research on screen exposure in children's naturalistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepa...</summary><p>Prepare for submission</p></details> |

However, effectively adapting VLMs to downstream applications remains challenging, as their accuracy often depends on time-intensive and expertise-demanding prompt engineering, while full model fine-tuning is costly. This is particularly true for biomedical images, which, unlike natural images, typically suffer from limited annotated datasets, unintuitive image contrasts, and nuanced visual features. Recent prompt learning techniques, such as Context Optimization (CoOp) intend to tackle these issues, but still fall short in generalizability. Meanwhile, explorations in prompt learning for biomedical image analysis are still highly limited. In this work, we propose BiomedCoOp, a novel prompt learning framework that enables efficient adaptation of BiomedCLIP for accurate and highly generalizable few-shot biomedical image classification. Our approach achieves effective prompt context learning by leveraging semantic consistency with average prompt ensembles from Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge distillation with a statistics-based prompt selection strategy. We conducted comprehensive validation of our proposed framework on 11 medical datasets across 9 modalities and 10 organs against existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and generalizability.

While task-specific LoRAs are often available, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property can restrict access to training data, limiting the acquisition of a multi-task model through gradient-based training. In response, LoRA merging presents an effective solution by combining multiple LoRAs into a unified adapter while maintaining data privacy. Prior works on LoRA merging primarily frame it as an optimization problem, yet these approaches face several limitations, including the rough assumption about input features utilized in optimization, massive sample requirements, and the unbalanced optimization objective. These limitations can significantly degrade performance. To address these, we propose a novel optimization-based method, named IterIS: 1) We formulate LoRA merging as an advanced optimization problem to mitigate the rough assumption. Additionally, we employ an iterative inference-solving framework in our algorithm. It can progressively refine the optimization objective for improved performance. 2) We introduce an efficient regularization term to reduce the need for massive sample requirements (requiring only 1-5% of the unlabeled samples compared to prior methods). 3) We utilize adaptive weights in the optimization objective to mitigate potential unbalances in LoRA merging process. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over multiple baselines and state-of-the-art methods in composing tasks for text-to-image diffusion, vision-language models, and large language models. Furthermore, our layer-wise algorithm can achieve convergence with minimal steps, ensuring efficiency in both memory and computation.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches have identified biases using highly curated validation subsets, that require human knowledge to create in the first place. This limits the ability to automate the discovery of unknown biases in new datasets. We solve this by using interpretable vision-language models, combined with a filtration method using LLMs and known concept hierarchies. More exactly, for a dataset, we use pre-trained CLIP models that have an associated embedding for each class and see how it drifts through learning towards embeddings that disclose hidden biases. We call this approach ConceptDrift and show that it can be scaled to automatically identify biases in datasets like ImageNet without human prior knowledge. We propose two bias identification evaluation protocols to fill the gap in the previous work and show that our method significantly improves over SoTA methods, both using our protocol and classical evaluations. Alongside validating the identified biases, we also show that they can be leveraged to improve the performance of different methods. Our method is not bounded to a single modality, and we empirically validate it both on image (Waterbirds, CelebA, ImageNet), and text datasets (CivilComments).</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables, under review</p></details> |

However, their proficiency in spatial reasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving navigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, most of these tasks rely on the core spatial reasoning capabilities in two-dimensional (2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlessly at a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2D spatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model solely on basic spatial capabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatial reasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving, with generalized improvements in visual-spatial tasks. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that fine-tunes VLMs on these three basic spatial capabilities by synthetic data generation and targeted supervision to form an instruction dataset for each capability. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significant performance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also in generalizing to composite and out-of-distribution spatial reasoning tasks. These findings underscore the effectiveness of mastering basic spatial capabilities in enhancing composite spatial problem-solving, offering insights into systematic strategies for improving VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

So far, VLM reward models have only been used for goal-oriented tasks, where the agent must reach a particular final outcome. We explore VLMs' potential to supervise tasks that cannot be scored by the final state alone. To this end, we introduce ViSTa, a dataset for evaluating Vision-based understanding of Sequential Tasks. ViSTa comprises over 4,000 videos with step-by-step descriptions in virtual home, Minecraft, and real-world environments. Its novel hierarchical structure -- basic single-step tasks composed into more and more complex sequential tasks -- allows a fine-grained understanding of how well VLMs can judge tasks with varying complexity. To illustrate this, we use ViSTa to evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs, including CLIP, ViCLIP, and GPT-4o. We find that, while they are all good at object recognition, they fail to understand sequential tasks, with only GPT-4o achieving non-trivial performance.</p></details> |  |

However, despite showing promising performance, LVLMs suffer from hallucinations caused by language bias, leading to diminished focus on images and ineffective visual comprehension. We identify two primary reasons for this bias: 1. Different scales of training data between the pretraining stage of LLM and multimodal alignment stage. 2. The learned inference bias due to short-term dependency of text data. Therefore, we propose LACING, a systemic framework designed to address the language bias of LVLMs with muLtimodal duAl-attention meChanIsm (MDA) aNd soft-image Guidance (IFG). Specifically, MDA introduces a parallel dual-attention mechanism that enhances the integration of visual inputs across the model. IFG introduces a learnable soft visual prompt during training and inference to replace visual inputs, designed to compel LVLMs to prioritize text inputs. Then, IFG further proposes a novel decoding strategy using the soft visual prompt to mitigate the model's over-reliance on adjacent text inputs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively debiases LVLMs from their language bias, enhancing visual comprehension and reducing hallucinations without requiring additional training resources or data.

To address these limitations, we propose VeriGraph, a novel framework that integrates VLMs for robotic planning while verifying action feasibility. VeriGraph employs scene graphs as an intermediate representation, capturing key objects and spatial relationships to improve plan verification and refinement. The system generates a scene graph from input images and uses it to iteratively check and correct action sequences generated by an LLM-based task planner, ensuring constraints are respected and actions are executable. Our approach significantly enhances task completion rates across diverse manipulation scenarios, outperforming baseline methods by 58% for language-based tasks and 30% for image-based tasks.</p></details> |  |

Typically, LVLMs utilize visual encoders, such as CLIP, to transform images into visual tokens, which are then aligned with textual tokens through projection layers before being input into the LLM for inference. Although existing LVLMs have achieved significant success, their inference efficiency is still limited by the substantial number of visual tokens and the potential redundancy among them. To mitigate this issue, we propose Focal Pruning (FoPru), a training-free method that prunes visual tokens based on the attention-based token significance derived from the vision encoder. Specifically, we introduce two alternative pruning strategies: 1) the rank strategy, which leverages all token significance scores to retain more critical tokens in a global view; 2) the row strategy, which focuses on preserving continuous key information in images from a local perspective. Finally, the selected tokens are reordered to maintain their original positional relationships.

Advancements in vision-language models have significantly improved performance on tasks that require processing explicit and direct textual inputs, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Visual Grounding (VG). However, less attention has been given to improving the model capabilities to comprehend nuanced and ambiguous forms of communication. This presents a critical challenge, as human language in real-world interactions often convey hidden intentions that rely on context for accurate interpretation. To address this gap, we propose VAGUE, a multimodal benchmark comprising 3.9K indirect human utterances paired with corresponding scenes. Additionally, we contribute a model-based pipeline for generating prompt-solution pairs from input images. Our work aims to delve deeper into the ability of models to understand indirect communication and seek to contribute to the development of models capable of more refined and human-like interactions. Extensive evaluation on multiple VLMs reveals that mainstream models still struggle with indirect communication when required to perform complex linguistic and visual reasoning. We release our code and data at https://github.com/Hazel-Heejeong-Nam/VAGUE.git.</p></details> |  |

However, astronomical image-label datasets are significantly smaller compared to general image and label datasets available from the internet. We introduce CosmoCLIP, an astronomical image-text contrastive learning framework precisely fine-tuned on the pre-trained CLIP model using SpaceNet and BLIP-based captions. SpaceNet, attained via FLARE, constitutes ~13k optimally distributed images, while BLIP acts as a rich knowledge extractor. The rich semantics derived from this SpaceNet and BLIP descriptions, when learned contrastively, enable CosmoCLIP to achieve superior generalization across various in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Our results demonstrate that CosmoCLIP is a straightforward yet powerful framework, significantly outperforming CLIP in zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SPAICE Conference, ECSAT, UK, 2024</p></details> |

Real-world tasks require handling intricate interactions, advanced spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous exploration of new strategies-areas in which we lack effective methodologies for comprehensively evaluating these capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce BALROG, a novel benchmark designed to assess the agentic capabilities of LLMs and VLMs through a diverse set of challenging games. Our benchmark incorporates a range of existing reinforcement learning environments with varying levels of difficulty, including tasks that are solvable by non-expert humans in seconds to extremely challenging ones that may take years to master (e.g., the NetHack Learning Environment). We devise fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an extensive evaluation of several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs and VLMs. Our findings indicate that while current models achieve partial success in the easier games, they struggle significantly with more challenging tasks. Notably, we observe severe deficiencies in vision-based decision-making, as models perform worse when visual representations of the environments are provided. We release BALROG as an open and user-friendly benchmark to facilitate future research and development in the agentic community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Teaching VLMs to Localize Specific Objects from In-context Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13317v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse visual tasks, including image recognition, video understanding, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) when explicitly trained for these tasks. Despite these advances, we find that current VLMs lack a fundamental cognitive ability: learning to localize objects in a scene by taking into account the context. In this work, we focus on the task of few-shot personalized localization, where a model is given a small set of annotated images (in-context examples) -- each with a category label and bounding box -- and is tasked with localizing the same object type in a query image. To provoke personalized localization abilities in models, we present a data-centric solution that fine-tunes them using carefully curated data from video object tracking datasets. By leveraging sequences of frames tracking the same object across multiple shots, we simulate instruction-tuning dialogues that promote context awareness. To reinforce this, we introduce a novel regularization technique that replaces object labels with pseudo-names, ensuring the model relies on visual context rather than prior knowledge. Our method significantly enhances few-shot localization performance without sacrificing generalization, as demonstrated on several benchmarks tailored to personalized localization. This work is the first to explore and benchmark personalized few-shot localization for VLMs, laying a foundation for future research in context-driven vision-language applications.

Nevertheless, traditional techniques such as global feature alignment or vision-language model distillation tend to impose only approximate correspondence, struggling notably with delineating fine-grained segmentation boundaries. To address this gap, we propose a more meticulous mask-level alignment between 3D features and the 2D-text embedding space through a cross-modal mask reasoning framework, XMask3D. In our approach, we developed a mask generator based on the denoising UNet from a pre-trained diffusion model, leveraging its capability for precise textual control over dense pixel representations and enhancing the open-world adaptability of the generated masks. We further integrate 3D global features as implicit conditions into the pre-trained 2D denoising UNet, enabling the generation of segmentation masks with additional 3D geometry awareness. Subsequently, the generated 2D masks are employed to align mask-level 3D representations with the vision-language feature space, thereby augmenting the open vocabulary capability of 3D geometry embeddings. Finally, we fuse complementary 2D and 3D mask features, resulting in competitive performance across multiple benchmarks for 3D open vocabulary semantic segmentation.

However, most existing methods rely on computationally expensive visual encoders and large language models (LLMs), making them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios and real-time applications. Meanwhile, most existing VLMs lack the ability to process multiple images, making it difficult to adapt to multi-camera perception in autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called MiniDrive, which incorporates our proposed Feature Engineering Mixture of Experts (FE-MoE) module and Dynamic Instruction Adapter (DI-Adapter). The FE-MoE effectively maps 2D features into visual token embeddings before being input into the language model. The DI-Adapter enables the visual token embeddings to dynamically change with the instruction text embeddings, resolving the issue of static visual token embeddings for the same image in previous approaches. Compared to previous works, MiniDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of parameter size, floating point operations, and response efficiency, with the smallest version containing only 83M parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have shown that the inference performance of CLIP can be greatly degraded by small adversarial perturbations, especially its visual modality, posing significant safety threats. To mitigate this vulnerability, in this paper, we propose a novel defense method called Test-Time Adversarial Prompt Tuning (TAPT) to enhance the inference robustness of CLIP against visual adversarial attacks. TAPT is a test-time defense method that learns defensive bimodal (textual and visual) prompts to robustify the inference process of CLIP. Specifically, it is an unsupervised method that optimizes the defensive prompts for each test sample by minimizing a multi-view entropy and aligning adversarial-clean distributions. We evaluate the effectiveness of TAPT on 11 benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and 10 other zero-shot datasets, demonstrating that it enhances the zero-shot adversarial robustness of the original CLIP by at least 48.9% against AutoAttack (AA), while largely maintaining performance on clean examples. Moreover, TAPT outperforms existing adversarial prompt tuning methods across various backbones, achieving an average robustness improvement of at least 36.6%.</p></details> |  |

They typically focus on simple tasks that do not require deep reasoning or the integration of multiple data modalities to solve an original problem. To address this gap, we introduce the PARROT-360V Benchmark, a novel and comprehensive benchmark featuring 2487 challenging visual puzzles designed to test VLMs on complex visual reasoning tasks. We evaluated leading models: GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro, using PARROT-360V to assess their capabilities in combining visual clues with language skills to solve tasks in a manner akin to human problem-solving. Our findings reveal a notable performance gap: state-of-the-art models scored between 28 to 56 percentage on our benchmark, significantly lower than their performance on popular benchmarks. This underscores the limitations of current VLMs in handling complex, multi-step reasoning tasks and highlights the need for more robust evaluation frameworks to advance the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, Accepted at COLING 2025</p></details> |

In traditional computer vision tasks, creative or approximate answers may be acceptable, but in healthcare, precision is paramount.Current large multimodal models like Gemini and GPT-4o are insufficient for medical tasks due to their reliance on memorized internet knowledge rather than the nuanced expertise required in healthcare. VLMs are usually trained in three stages: vision pre-training, vision-language pre-training, and instruction fine-tuning (IFT). IFT has been typically applied using a mixture of generic and healthcare data. In contrast, we propose that for medical VLMs, a fourth stage of specialized IFT is necessary, which focuses on medical data and includes information from domain expert models. Domain expert models developed for medical use are crucial because they are specifically trained for certain clinical tasks, e.g. to detect tumors and classify abnormalities through segmentation and classification, which learn fine-grained features of medical data$-$features that are often too intricate for a VLM to capture effectively especially in radiology. This paper introduces a new framework, VILA-M3, for medical VLMs that utilizes domain knowledge via expert models. Through our experiments, we show an improved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an average improvement of ~9% over the prior SOTA model Med-Gemini and ~6% over models trained on the specific tasks. Our approach emphasizes the importance of domain expertise in creating precise, reliable VLMs for medical applications.</p></details> |  |

These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare seven public "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting regime for medical question-answering (QA) tasks. For instance, across the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the remaining 38.2% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model head-to-head, directly against the corresponding base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. While these basic practices are not consistently adopted in the literature, our ablations show that they substantially impact conclusions. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version was published at EMNLP 2024 Main Conference as a Long Paper (Oral).

Despite previous efforts to mitigate hallucinations, a persistent issue remains: visual defect from vision-language misalignment, creating a bottleneck in visual processing capacity. To address this challenge, we develop Complementary Adaptive Token-level Contrastive Decoding to Mitigate Hallucinations in LVLMs (CATCH), based on the Information Bottleneck theory. CATCH introduces Complementary Visual Decoupling (CVD) for visual information separation, Non-Visual Screening (NVS) for hallucination detection, and Adaptive Token-level Contrastive Decoding (ATCD) for hallucination mitigation. CATCH addresses issues related to visual defects that cause diminished fine-grained feature perception and cumulative hallucinations in open-ended scenarios. It is applicable to various visual question-answering tasks without requiring any specific data or prior knowledge, and generalizes robustly to new tasks without additional training, opening new possibilities for advancing LVLM in various challenging applications.</p></details> |  |

While LVLMs exhibit excellent ability in language understanding, question answering, and conversations of visual inputs, they are prone to producing hallucinations. While several methods are proposed to evaluate the hallucinations in LVLMs, most are reference-based and depend on external tools, which complicates their practical application. To assess the viability of alternative methods, it is critical to understand whether the reference-free approaches, which do not rely on any external tools, can efficiently detect hallucinations. Therefore, we initiate an exploratory study to demonstrate the effectiveness of different reference-free solutions in detecting hallucinations in LVLMs. In particular, we conduct an extensive study on three kinds of techniques: uncertainty-based, consistency-based, and supervised uncertainty quantification methods on four representative LVLMs across two different tasks. The empirical results show that the reference-free approaches are capable of effectively detecting non-factual responses in LVLMs, with the supervised uncertainty quantification method outperforming the others, achieving the best performance across different settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alleviating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models through Hallucination-Induced Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15356v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in understanding multimodal data, they invariably suffer from hallucinations, leading to a disconnect between the generated text and the corresponding images. Almost all current visual contrastive decoding methods attempt to mitigate these hallucinations by introducing visual uncertainty information that appropriately widens the contrastive logits gap between hallucinatory and targeted ones. However, due to uncontrollable nature of the global visual uncertainty, they struggle to precisely induce the hallucinatory tokens, which severely limits their effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and may even lead to the generation of undesired hallucinations. To tackle this issue, we conducted the theoretical analysis to promote the effectiveness of contrast decoding. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel optimization strategy named Hallucination-Induced Optimization (HIO). This strategy seeks to amplify the contrast between hallucinatory and targeted tokens relying on a fine-tuned theoretical preference model (i.e., Contrary Bradley-Terry Model), thereby facilitating efficient contrast decoding to alleviate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experimental research demonstrates that our HIO strategy can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.16922 by other authors</p></details> |

Nevertheless, LLMs are prone to hallucination, generating plausible yet nonfactual content. This phenomenon raises significant concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world information retrieval (IR) systems and has attracted intensive research to detect and mitigate such hallucinations. Given the open-ended general-purpose attributes inherent to LLMs, LLM hallucinations present distinct challenges that diverge from prior task-specific models. This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations. In this survey, we begin with an innovative taxonomy of hallucination in the era of LLM and then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a thorough overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Our discussion then transfers to representative methodologies for mitigating LLM hallucinations. Additionally, we delve into the current limitations faced by retrieval-augmented LLMs in combating hallucinations, offering insights for developing more robust IR systems. Finally, we highlight the promising research directions on LLM hallucinations, including hallucination in large vision-language models and understanding of knowledge boundaries in LLM hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)</p></details> |

It is believed that fine-tuning the parameters of VLMs with few-shot samples corrupts the pre-trained knowledge since fine-tuning the CLIP model even degrades performance. In this paper, we revisit this viewpoint, and propose a new perspective: fine-tuning the specific parameters instead of all will uncover the power of classic model fine-tuning on VLMs. Through our meticulous study, we propose ClipFit, a simple yet effective method to fine-tune CLIP without introducing any overhead of extra parameters. We demonstrate that by only fine-tuning the specific bias terms and normalization layers, ClipFit can improve the performance of zero-shot CLIP by 7.27\% average harmonic mean accuracy. Lastly, to understand how fine-tuning in CLIPFit affects the pre-trained models, we conducted extensive experimental analyses w.r.t. changes in internal parameters and representations. We found that low-level text bias layers and the first layer normalization layer change much more than other layers.

Exploring How Safe Images Can Be Exploited to Jailbreak Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11496v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have showcased strong reasoning abilities across multiple modalities, achieving significant breakthroughs in various real-world applications. Despite this great success, the safety guardrail of LVLMs may not cover the unforeseen domains introduced by the visual modality. Existing studies primarily focus on eliciting LVLMs to generate harmful responses via carefully crafted image-based jailbreaks designed to bypass alignment defenses. In this study, we reveal that a safe image can be exploited to achieve the same jailbreak consequence when combined with additional safe images and prompts. This stems from two fundamental properties of LVLMs: universal reasoning capabilities and safety snowball effect. Building on these insights, we propose Safety Snowball Agent (SSA), a novel agent-based framework leveraging agents' autonomous and tool-using abilities to jailbreak LVLMs. SSA operates through two principal stages: (1) initial response generation, where tools generate or retrieve jailbreak images based on potential harmful intents, and (2) harmful snowballing, where refined subsequent prompts induce progressively harmful outputs. Our experiments demonstrate that \ours can use nearly any image to induce LVLMs to produce unsafe content, achieving high success jailbreaking rates against the latest LVLMs. Unlike prior works that exploit alignment flaws, \ours leverages the inherent properties of LVLMs, presenting a profound challenge for enforcing safety in generative multimodal systems.

Specifically, we instruct VLMs to perform audio classification tasks in a few-shot setting by prompting them to classify a spectrogram image given example spectrogram images of each class. By carefully designing the spectrogram image representation and selecting good few-shot examples, we show that GPT-4o can achieve 59.00% cross-validated accuracy on the ESC-10 environmental sound classification dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that VLMs currently outperform the only available commercial audio language model with audio understanding capabilities (Gemini-1.5) on the equivalent audio classification task (59.00% vs. 49.62%), and even perform slightly better than human experts on visual spectrogram classification (73.75% vs. 72.50% on first fold). We envision two potential use cases for these findings: (1) combining the spectrogram and language understanding capabilities of VLMs for audio caption augmentation, and (2) posing visual spectrogram classification as a challenge task for VLMs.</p></details> |  |

These foundational models, especially CLIP, have accelerated research in open-vocabulary computer vision tasks, including Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS). Although the initial results are promising, the dense prediction capabilities of VLMs still require further improvement. In this study, we enhance the semantic segmentation performance of CLIP by introducing new modules and modifications: 1) architectural changes in the last layer of ViT and the incorporation of attention maps from the middle layers with the last layer, 2) Image Engineering: applying data augmentations to enrich input image representations, and 3) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate definitions and synonyms for each class name to leverage CLIP's open-vocabulary capabilities.

To enhance user experience in practical applications, recent studies investigate VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, existing studies mainly focus on single-concept personalization, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits the real-world applicability of personalized VLMs. In this paper, we propose the first multi-concept personalization method named MC-LLaVA along with a high-quality multi-concept personalization dataset. Specifically, MC-LLaVA uses a joint training strategy incorporating multiple concepts in a single training step, allowing VLMs to perform accurately in multi-concept personalization. To reduce the cost of joint training, MC-LLaVA leverages visual token information for concept token initialization, yielding improved concept representation and accelerating joint training. To advance multi-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality dataset. We carefully collect images from various movies that contain multiple characters and manually generate the multi-concept question-answer samples. Our dataset features diverse movie types and question-answer types. We conduct comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that MC-LLaVA can achieve impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user-specific assistants.

To alleviate artifacts and improve quality of synthetic images, we fine-tune Vision-Language Model (VLM) as artifact classifier to automatically identify and classify a wide range of artifacts and provide supervision for further optimizing generative models. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive artifact taxonomy and construct a dataset of synthetic images with artifact annotations for fine-tuning VLM, named SynArtifact-1K. The fine-tuned VLM exhibits superior ability of identifying artifacts and outperforms the baseline by 25.66%. To our knowledge, this is the first time such end-to-end artifact classification task and solution have been proposed. Finally, we leverage the output of VLM as feedback to refine the generative model for alleviating artifacts. Visualization results and user study demonstrate that the quality of images synthesized by the refined diffusion model has been obviously improved.</p></details> |  |

Most of the previous works on object goal navigation have typically focused on a single input modality as the target, which may lead to limited consideration of language descriptions containing detailed attributes and spatial relationships. To address this limitation, we propose VLN-Game, a novel zero-shot framework for visual target navigation that can process object names and descriptive language targets effectively. To be more precise, our approach constructs a 3D object-centric spatial map by integrating pre-trained visual-language features with a 3D reconstruction of the physical environment. Then, the framework identifies the most promising areas to explore in search of potential target candidates. A game-theoretic vision language model is employed to determine which target best matches the given language description. Experiments conducted on the Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object goal navigation and language-based navigation tasks. Moreover, we show that VLN-Game can be easily deployed on real-world robots. The success of VLN-Game highlights the promising potential of using game-theoretic methods with compact vision-language models to advance decision-making capabilities in robotic systems.

However, recent research shows that the visual modality in VLMs is highly vulnerable, allowing attackers to bypass safety alignment in LLMs through visually transmitted content, launching harmful attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular VLM safety benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.13581</p></details> |

To address this gap, we introduce Value-Spectrum, a visual question-answering benchmark aimed at assessing VLMs based on Schwartz's value dimensions, which capture core values guiding people's beliefs and actions across cultures. We constructed a vectorized database of over 50,000 short videos sourced from TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels, covering multiple months and a wide array of topics such as family, health, hobbies, society, and technology. We also developed a VLM agent pipeline to automate video browsing and analysis. Benchmarking representative VLMs on Value-Spectrum reveals significant differences in their responses to value-oriented content, with most models exhibiting a preference for hedonistic topics. Beyond identifying natural preferences, we explored the ability of VLM agents to adopt specific personas when explicitly prompted, revealing insights into the models' adaptability in role-playing scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of Value-Spectrum as a comprehensive evaluation set for tracking VLM advancements in value-based tasks and for developing more sophisticated role-playing AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[VL-Uncertainty: Detecting Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Model via Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11919v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the higher information load processed by large vision-language models (LVLMs) compared to single-modal LLMs, detecting LVLM hallucinations requires more human and time expense, and thus rise a wider safety concerns. In this paper, we introduce VL-Uncertainty, the first uncertainty-based framework for detecting hallucinations in LVLMs. Different from most existing methods that require ground-truth or pseudo annotations, VL-Uncertainty utilizes uncertainty as an intrinsic metric. We measure uncertainty by analyzing the prediction variance across semantically equivalent but perturbed prompts, including visual and textual data. When LVLMs are highly confident, they provide consistent responses to semantically equivalent queries. However, when uncertain, the responses of the target LVLM become more random. Considering semantically similar answers with different wordings, we cluster LVLM responses based on their semantic content and then calculate the cluster distribution entropy as the uncertainty measure to detect hallucination. Our extensive experiments on 10 LVLMs across four benchmarks, covering both free-form and multi-choice tasks, show that VL-Uncertainty significantly outperforms strong baseline methods in hallucination detection.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Efficient Transfer Learning for Video-language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11223v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models provide a robust foundation for efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional parameter modules to capture temporal information. While the increased model capacity brought by these additional parameters helps better fit the video-specific inductive biases, existing methods require learning a large number of parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of the original generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to improve the alignment between representations in the text and vision branches, achieving a balance between general knowledge and task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint. This constraint involves feeding template inputs (i.e., ``a video of $\{\textbf{cls}\}$'') into the trainable language branch, while LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions are input into the pre-trained language branch, enforcing consistency between the outputs of the two branches. This mechanism prevents over-fitting to downstream tasks and improves the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model.

However, existing works either fail to capture every individual preference precisely or become computationally inefficient as the user base expands. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising solutions to this front through their natural language understanding and scene reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective on-board VLM framework that provides low-latency personalized driving performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Our solution incorporates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based memory module that enables continuous learning of individual driving preferences through human feedback. Through comprehensive real-world vehicle deployment and experiments, our system has demonstrated the ability to provide safe, comfortable, and personalized driving experiences across various scenarios and significantly reduce takeover rates by up to 76.9%. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first end-to-end VLM-based motion control system in real-world autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we demonstrate the impact of two factors \textit{viz.}, client-specific layer importance score that selects the most important VLM layers for fine-tuning and inter-client layer diversity score that encourages diverse layer selection across clients for optimal VLM layer selection. We first theoretically motivate and leverage the principal eigenvalue magnitude of layerwise Neural Tangent Kernels and show its effectiveness as client-specific layer importance score. Next, we propose a novel layer updating strategy dubbed F$^3$OCUS that jointly optimizes the layer importance and diversity factors by employing a data-free, multi-objective, meta-heuristic optimization on the server. We explore 5 different meta-heuristic algorithms and compare their effectiveness for selecting model layers and adapter layers towards PEFT-FL. Furthermore, we release a new MedVQA-FL dataset involving overall 707,962 VQA triplets and 9 modality-specific clients and utilize it to train and evaluate our method. Overall, we conduct more than 10,000 client-level experiments on 6 Vision-Language FL task settings involving 58 medical image datasets and 4 different VLM architectures of varying sizes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting VLM Localizability and Semantics for Open Vocabulary Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10922v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action detection aims to detect (recognize and localize) human actions spatially and temporally in videos. Existing approaches focus on the closed-set setting where an action detector is trained and tested on videos from a fixed set of action categories. However, this constrained setting is not viable in an open world where test videos inevitably come beyond the trained action categories. In this paper, we address the practical yet challenging Open-Vocabulary Action Detection (OVAD) problem. It aims to detect any action in test videos while training a model on a fixed set of action categories. To achieve such an open-vocabulary capability, we propose a novel method OpenMixer that exploits the inherent semantics and localizability of large vision-language models (VLM) within the family of query-based detection transformers (DETR). Specifically, the OpenMixer is developed by spatial and temporal OpenMixer blocks (S-OMB and T-OMB), and a dynamically fused alignment (DFA) module. The three components collectively enjoy the merits of strong generalization from pre-trained VLMs and end-to-end learning from DETR design. Moreover, we established OVAD benchmarks under various settings, and the experimental results show that the OpenMixer performs the best over baselines for detecting seen and unseen actions. We release the codes, models, and dataset splits at https://github.com/Cogito2012/OpenMixer.</p></details> | WACV 2025 Accepted |

Mpox (caused by the monkeypox virus) is a notable example of a zoonotic infection that often goes undiagnosed, especially as its rash progresses through stages, complicating detection across diverse populations with different presentations. In August 2024, the WHO Director-General declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern for a second time. Despite the deployment of deep learning techniques for detecting diseases from skin lesion images, a robust and publicly accessible foundation model for mpox diagnosis is still lacking due to the unavailability of open-source mpox skin lesion images, multimodal clinical data, and specialized training pipelines. To address this gap, we propose MpoxVLM, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to detect mpox by analyzing both skin lesion images and patient clinical information. MpoxVLM integrates the CLIP visual encoder, an enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier for skin lesions, and LLaMA-2-7B models, pre-trained and fine-tuned on visual instruction-following question-answer pairs from our newly released mpox skin lesion dataset. Our work achieves 90.38% accuracy for mpox detection, offering a promising pathway to improve early diagnostic accuracy in combating mpox.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ML4H 2024</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often rely on separate visual feature extractors and language processing models, which can be computationally intensive and limited in their ability to handle open-ended questions. In this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages a generative Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to streamline the RSVQA process. Our approach consists of a two-step training strategy: domain-adaptive pretraining and prompt-based finetuning. This method enables the LVLM to generate natural language answers by conditioning on both visual and textual inputs, without the need for predefined answer categories. We evaluate our model on the RSVQAxBEN dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a human evaluation study shows that our method produces answers that are more accurate, relevant, and fluent. The results highlight the potential of generative LVLMs in advancing the field of remote sensing analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Language Modeling with Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks for All Weather Crosswind Landing of Aircraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05574v2)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intrinsic capability of the Human Vision System (HVS) to perceive depth of field and failure of Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) stimulates a pilot to perform a vision-based manual landing over an autoland approach. However, harsh weather creates challenges, and a pilot must have a clear view of runway elements before the minimum decision altitude. To aid in manual landing, a vision-based system trained to clear weather-induced visual degradations requires a robust landing dataset under various climatic conditions. Nevertheless, to acquire a dataset, flying an aircraft in dangerous weather impacts safety. Also, this system fails to generate reliable warnings, as localization of runway elements suffers from projective distortion while landing at crosswind. To combat, we propose to synthesize harsh weather landing images by training a prompt-based climatic diffusion network. Also, we optimize a weather distillation model using a novel diffusion-distillation loss to learn to clear these visual degradations. Precisely, the distillation model learns an inverse relationship with the diffusion network. Inference time, pre-trained distillation network directly clears weather-impacted onboard camera images, which can be further projected to display devices for improved visibility.Then, to tackle crosswind landing, a novel Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks (RuSTaN) module accurately warps landing images. It minimizes the localization error of runway object detector and helps generate reliable internal software warnings. Finally, we curated an aircraft landing dataset (AIRLAD) by simulating a landing scenario under various weather degradations and experimentally validated our contributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Indian Conference on Vision Graphics and Image Processing - ICVGIP 2024</p></details> |
| **[LLaSA: Large Language and Structured Data Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14460v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured data, such as tables, graphs, and databases, play a critical role in plentiful NLP tasks such as question answering and dialogue system. Recently, inspired by Vision-Language Models, Graph Neutral Networks (GNNs) have been introduced as an additional modality into the input of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their performance on Structured Knowledge Grounding (SKG) tasks. However, those GNN-enhanced LLMs have the following limitations: (1) They employ diverse GNNs to model varying types of structured data, rendering them unable to uniformly process various forms of structured data. (2) The pretraining of GNNs is coupled with specific LLMs, which prevents GNNs from fully aligning with the textual space and limits their adaptability to other LLMs. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage and \textbf{S}tructured Data \textbf{A}ssistant (LLaSA), a general framework for enhancing LLMs' ability to handle structured data. Specifically, we represent various types of structured data in a unified hypergraph format, and use self-supervised learning to pretrain a hypergraph encoder, and a G-Former compressing encoded hypergraph representations with cross-attention. The compressed hypergraph representations are appended to the serialized inputs during training and inference stages of LLMs. Experimental results on multiple SKG tasks show that our pretrained hypergraph encoder can adapt to various LLMs and enhance their ability to process different types of structured data. Besides, LLaSA, with LoRA fine-tuning, outperforms previous SOTA method using full parameters tuning.</p></details> |  |

To address the challenge of transferring features from known to unknown classes while mitigating model bias, we introduce GraphVL, a novel approach for vision-language modeling in GCD, leveraging CLIP. Our method integrates a graph convolutional network (GCN) with CLIP's text encoder to preserve class neighborhood structure. We also employ a lightweight visual projector for image data, ensuring discriminative features through margin-based contrastive losses for image-text mapping. This neighborhood preservation criterion effectively regulates the semantic space, making it less sensitive to known classes. Additionally, we learn textual prompts from known classes and align them to create a more contextually meaningful semantic feature space for the GCN layer using a contextual similarity loss. Finally, we represent unlabeled samples based on their semantic distance to class prompts from the GCN, enabling semi-supervised clustering for class discovery and minimizing errors. Our experiments on seven benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of GraphVL when integrated with the CLIP backbone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM ICVGIP 2024</p></details> |

Recent methods harness the powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) for 2D-to-3D knowledge distillation, achieving zero-shot 3D part segmentation. However, these methods are limited by their reliance on text prompts, which restricts the scalability to large-scale unlabeled datasets and the flexibility in handling part ambiguities. In this work, we introduce SAMPart3D, a scalable zero-shot 3D part segmentation framework that segments any 3D object into semantic parts at multiple granularities, without requiring predefined part label sets as text prompts. For scalability, we use text-agnostic vision foundation models to distill a 3D feature extraction backbone, allowing scaling to large unlabeled 3D datasets to learn rich 3D priors. For flexibility, we distill scale-conditioned part-aware 3D features for 3D part segmentation at multiple granularities. Once the segmented parts are obtained from the scale-conditioned part-aware 3D features, we use VLMs to assign semantic labels to each part based on the multi-view renderings. Compared to previous methods, our SAMPart3D can scale to the recent large-scale 3D object dataset Objaverse and handle complex, non-ordinary objects. Additionally, we contribute a new 3D part segmentation benchmark to address the lack of diversity and complexity of objects and parts in existing benchmarks. Experiments show that our SAMPart3D significantly outperforms existing zero-shot 3D part segmentation methods, and can facilitate various applications such as part-level editing and interactive segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yhyang-myron.github.io/SAMPart3D-website/</p></details> |
| **[GeoGround: A Unified Large Vision-Language Model. for Remote Sensing Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11904v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing (RS) visual grounding aims to use natural language expression to locate specific objects (in the form of the bounding box or segmentation mask) in RS images, enhancing human interaction with intelligent RS interpretation systems. Early research in this area was primarily based on horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs), but as more diverse RS datasets have become available, tasks involving oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) and segmentation masks have emerged. In practical applications, different targets require different grounding types: HBB can localize an object's position, OBB provides its orientation, and mask depicts its shape. However, existing specialized methods are typically tailored to a single type of RS visual grounding task and are hard to generalize across tasks. In contrast, large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit powerful multi-task learning capabilities but struggle to handle dense prediction tasks like segmentation. This paper proposes GeoGround, a novel framework that unifies support for HBB, OBB, and mask RS visual grounding tasks, allowing flexible output selection. Rather than customizing the architecture of VLM, our work aims to elegantly support pixel-level visual grounding output through the Text-Mask technique. We define prompt-assisted and geometry-guided learning to enhance consistency across different signals. To support model training, we present refGeo, a large-scale RS visual instruction-following dataset containing 161k image-text pairs. Experimental results show that GeoGround demonstrates strong performance across four RS visual grounding tasks, matching or surpassing the performance of specialized methods on multiple benchmarks.

While current Vision Language Models (VLMs) show promise, they are prone to generating hallucinations, potentially compromising patient care. We introduce RadFlag, a black-box method to enhance the accuracy of radiology report generation. Our method uses a sampling-based flagging technique to find hallucinatory generations that should be removed. We first sample multiple reports at varying temperatures and then use a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify claims that are not consistently supported across samples, indicating that the model has low confidence in those claims. Using a calibrated threshold, we flag a fraction of these claims as likely hallucinations, which should undergo extra review or be automatically rejected. Our method achieves high precision when identifying both individual hallucinatory sentences and reports that contain hallucinations. As an easy-to-use, black-box system that only requires access to a model's temperature parameter, RadFlag is compatible with a wide range of radiology report generation models and has the potential to broadly improve the quality of automated radiology reporting.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

This integration enhances Large Language Models' ability to mimic human perception, allowing them to process image inputs. Despite VLMs' advanced capabilities, however, there is a concern that VLMs inherit biases of both modalities in ways that make biases more pervasive and difficult to mitigate. Our study explores how VLMs perpetuate homogeneity bias and trait associations with regards to race and gender. When prompted to write stories based on images of human faces, GPT-4V describes subordinate racial and gender groups with greater homogeneity than dominant groups and relies on distinct, yet generally positive, stereotypes. Importantly, VLM stereotyping is driven by visual cues rather than group membership alone such that faces that are rated as more prototypically Black and feminine are subject to greater stereotyping. These findings suggest that VLMs may associate subtle visual cues related to racial and gender groups with stereotypes in ways that could be challenging to mitigate. We explore the underlying reasons behind this behavior and discuss its implications and emphasize the importance of addressing these biases as VLMs come to mirror human perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission is being withdrawn to address concerns related to the terms of use of a database utilized in the research.

To address this, we propose Sim-CLIP, an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning method that enhances the robustness of the widely-used CLIP vision encoder against such attacks while maintaining semantic richness and specificity. By employing a Siamese architecture with cosine similarity loss, Sim-CLIP learns semantically meaningful and attack-resilient visual representations without requiring large batch sizes or momentum encoders. Our results demonstrate that VLMs enhanced with Sim-CLIP's fine-tuned CLIP encoder exhibit significantly enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks, while preserving semantic meaning of the perturbed images. Notably, Sim-CLIP does not require additional training or fine-tuning of the VLM itself; replacing the original vision encoder with our fine-tuned Sim-CLIP suffices to provide robustness. This work underscores the significance of reinforcing foundational models like CLIP to safeguard the reliability of downstream VLM applications, paving the way for more secure and effective multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-o1, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-o1 independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-o1 to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-o1-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-o1 not only outperforms its base model by 8.9% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Conventional quantization methods sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by minimizing activation discretization errors, which fails to acquire optimal quantization strategy without considering cross-layer dependency. On the contrary, we mine the cross-layer dependency that significantly influences discretization errors of the entire vision-language model, and embed this dependency into optimal quantization strategy searching with low search cost. Specifically, we observe the strong correlation between the activation entropy and the cross-layer dependency concerning output discretization errors. Therefore, we employ the entropy as the proxy to partition blocks optimally, which aims to achieve satisfying trade-offs between discretization errors and the search cost. Moreover, we optimize the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained decomposition of search space, so that the search cost is further reduced without harming the quantization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method compresses the memory by 2.78x and increase generate speed by 1.44x about 13B LLaVA model without performance degradation on diverse multi-modal reasoning tasks.

The quality analysis of ROIs can provide fine-grained guidance for image quality improvement and is crucial for scenarios focusing on region-level quality. This paper proposes a novel network, SEAGULL, which can SEe and Assess ROIs quality with GUidance from a Large vision-Language model. SEAGULL incorporates a vision-language model (VLM), masks generated by Segment Anything Model (SAM) to specify ROIs, and a meticulously designed Mask-based Feature Extractor (MFE) to extract global and local tokens for specified ROIs, enabling accurate fine-grained IQA for ROIs. Moreover, this paper constructs two ROI-based IQA datasets, SEAGULL-100w and SEAGULL-3k, for training and evaluating ROI-based IQA. SEAGULL-100w comprises about 100w synthetic distortion images with 33 million ROIs for pre-training to improve the model's ability of regional quality perception, and SEAGULL-3k contains about 3k authentic distortion ROIs to enhance the model's ability to perceive real world distortions. After pre-training on SEAGULL-100w and fine-tuning on SEAGULL-3k, SEAGULL shows remarkable performance on fine-grained ROI quality assessment.

One challenge inherent to these methods is the poor generalization performance due to the invalidity of the learned text embeddings for unseen tasks. A straightforward approach to bridge this gap is to freeze the text embeddings in prompts, which results in a lack of capacity to adapt VLMs for downstream tasks. To address this dilemma, we propose a paradigm called EnPrompt with a novel External Layer (EnLa). Specifically, we propose a textual external layer and learnable visual embeddings for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. The learnable external layer is built upon valid embeddings of pre-trained CLIP. This design considers the balance of learning capabilities between the two branches. To align the textual and visual features, we propose a novel two-pronged approach: i) we introduce the optimal transport as the discrepancy metric to align the vision and text modalities, and ii) we introduce a novel strengthening feature to enhance the interaction between these two modalities. Four representative experiments (i.e., base-to-novel generalization, few-shot learning, cross-dataset generalization, domain shifts generalization) across 15 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing prompt learning method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Domain Generalization via Prompt Learning and Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10063v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated domain generalization (FedDG) aims to improve the global model generalization in unseen domains by addressing data heterogeneity under privacy-preserving constraints. A common strategy in existing FedDG studies involves sharing domain-specific knowledge among clients, such as spectrum information, class prototypes, and data styles. However, this knowledge is extracted directly from local client samples, and sharing such sensitive information poses a potential risk of data leakage, which might not fully meet the requirements of FedDG. In this paper, we introduce prompt learning to adapt pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) in the FedDG scenario, and leverage locally learned prompts as a more secure bridge to facilitate knowledge transfer among clients. Specifically, we propose a novel FedDG framework through Prompt Learning and AggregatioN (PLAN), which comprises two training stages to collaboratively generate local prompts and global prompts at each federated round. First, each client performs both text and visual prompt learning using their own data, with local prompts indirectly synchronized by regarding the global prompts as a common reference. Second, all domain-specific local prompts are exchanged among clients and selectively aggregated into the global prompts using lightweight attention-based aggregators. The global prompts are finally applied to adapt VLMs to unseen target domains. As our PLAN framework requires training only a limited number of prompts and lightweight aggregators, it offers notable advantages in computational and communication efficiency for FedDG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization ability of PLAN across four benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[COOD: Concept-based Zero-shot OOD Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13578v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can models effectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in complex, multi-label settings without extensive retraining? Existing OOD detection methods struggle to capture the intricate semantic relationships and label co-occurrences inherent in multi-label settings, often requiring large amounts of training data and failing to generalize to unseen label combinations. While large language models have revolutionized zero-shot OOD detection, they primarily focus on single-label scenarios, leaving a critical gap in handling real-world tasks where samples can be associated with multiple interdependent labels. To address these challenges, we introduce COOD, a novel zero-shot multi-label OOD detection framework. COOD leverages pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing them with a concept-based label expansion strategy and a new scoring function. By enriching the semantic space with both positive and negative concepts for each label, our approach models complex label dependencies, precisely differentiating OOD samples without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving approximately 95% average AUROC on both VOC and COCO datasets, while maintaining robust performance across varying numbers of labels and different types of OOD samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[IDEATOR: Jailbreaking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks--techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multi-modal data has led current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which may lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel jailbreak method named IDEATOR, which autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is based on the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR uses a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability. Notably, it achieves a 94% success rate in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high success rates of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Meta's Chameleon, respectively. IDEATOR uncovers specific vulnerabilities in VLMs under black-box conditions, underscoring the need for improved safety mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Does Vision-Language Adaptation Impact the Safety of Vision Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07571v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language adaptation (VL adaptation) transforms Large Language Models (LLMs) into Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for multimodal tasks, but this process often compromises the inherent safety capabilities embedded in the original LLMs. Despite potential harmfulness due to weakened safety measures, in-depth analysis on the effects of VL adaptation on safety remains under-explored. This study examines how VL adaptation influences safety and evaluates the impact of safety fine-tuning methods. Our analysis reveals that safety degradation occurs during VL adaptation, even when the training data is safe. While safety tuning techniques like supervised fine-tuning with safety datasets or reinforcement learning from human feedback mitigate some risks, they still lead to safety degradation and a reduction in helpfulness due to over-rejection issues. Further analysis of internal model weights suggests that VL adaptation may impact certain safety-related layers, potentially lowering overall safety levels. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the objectives of VL adaptation and safety tuning are divergent, which often results in their simultaneous application being suboptimal. To address this, we suggest the weight merging approach as an optimal solution effectively reducing safety degradation while maintaining helpfulness. These insights help guide the development of more reliable and secure LVLMs for real-world applications.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Free Lunch in Pathology Foundation Model: Task-specific Model Adaptation with Concept-Guided Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09894v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis is gaining prominence within the medical imaging field. Recent advances in pathology foundation models have shown the potential to extract powerful feature representations from WSIs for downstream tasks. However, these foundation models are usually designed for general-purpose pathology image analysis and may not be optimal for specific downstream tasks or cancer types. In this work, we present Concept Anchor-guided Task-specific Feature Enhancement (CATE), an adaptable paradigm that can boost the expressivity and discriminativeness of pathology foundation models for specific downstream tasks. Based on a set of task-specific concepts derived from the pathology vision-language model with expert-designed prompts, we introduce two interconnected modules to dynamically calibrate the generic image features extracted by foundation models for certain tasks or cancer types. Specifically, we design a Concept-guided Information Bottleneck module to enhance task-relevant characteristics by maximizing the mutual information between image features and concept anchors while suppressing superfluous information. Moreover, a Concept-Feature Interference module is proposed to utilize the similarity between calibrated features and concept anchors to further generate discriminative task-specific features. The extensive experiments on public WSI datasets demonstrate that CATE significantly enhances the performance and generalizability of MIL models. Additionally, heatmap and umap visualization results also reveal the effectiveness and interpretability of CATE. The source code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CATE.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROCKET-1: Mastering Open-World Interaction with Visual-Temporal Context Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17856v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in multimodal tasks, but adapting them to embodied decision-making in open-world environments presents challenges. One critical issue is bridging the gap between discrete entities in low-level observations and the abstract concepts required for effective planning. A common solution is building hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language. However, language suffers from the inability to communicate detailed spatial information. We propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from past observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, supported by real-time object tracking from SAM-2. Our method unlocks the potential of VLMs, enabling them to tackle complex tasks that demand spatial reasoning. Experiments in Minecraft show that our approach enables agents to achieve previously unattainable tasks, with a $\mathbf{76}\%$ absolute improvement in open-world interaction performance. Codes and demos are now available on the project page: https://craftjarvis.github.io/ROCKET-1.</p></details> |  |

| **[Advances in Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction and Quantitative Analysis for Biomedical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02843v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) represents an innovative biomedical imaging modality that harnesses the advantages of optical resolution and acoustic penetration depth while ensuring enhanced safety. Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG): point cloud-based iterative algorithm for large-scale 3D photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11781v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale 3D photoacoustic (PA) imaging has become increasingly important for both clinical and pre-clinical applications. Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging Systems: The Bayesian Cramér-Rao Bound Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09557v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution imaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and blood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v3)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GPU-Based Parallel Computing Methods for Medical Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10928v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement in GPU technology, establishing it as a formidable high-performance parallel computing technology with superior floating-point computational capabilities compared to traditional CPUs. This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-informed and wavelength-flexible data-driven photoacoustic oximetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14863v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significance: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) promises to measure spatially-resolved blood oxygen saturation, but suffers from a lack of accurate and robust spectral unmixing methods to deliver on this promise. Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arc-to-line frame registration method for ultrasound and photoacoustic image-guided intraoperative robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12590v1)** | 2023-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To achieve effective robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, the integration of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging system which is the most widely used imaging modelity in prostate imaging is essential. However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Photoacoustic image synthesis with generative adversarial networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15510v3)** | 2022-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has the potential to recover morphological and functional tissue properties with high spatial resolution. However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods.

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Optimizing the initial noisy latent offers a more efficient alternative to modifying model architectures or prompt engineering for improving semantic alignment. A latest approach, InitNo, refines the initial noisy latent by leveraging attention maps; however, these maps capture only limited information, and the effectiveness of InitNo is highly dependent on the initial starting point, as it tends to converge on a local optimum near this point. To this end, this paper proposes leveraging the language comprehension capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to guide the optimization of the initial noisy latent, and introduces the Noise Diffusion process, which updates the noisy latent to generate semantically faithful images while preserving distribution consistency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the condition under which the update improves semantic faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our framework, consistently enhancing semantic alignment across various diffusion models.

Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

Within diffusion frameworks, guidance techniques have proven effective in enhancing output quality during inference; however, applying these methods to video diffusion models introduces additional complexity of handling computations across entire sequences. To address this, we propose a novel framework called MotionPrompt that guides the video generation process via optical flow. Specifically, we train a discriminator to distinguish optical flow between random pairs of frames from real videos and generated ones. Given that prompts can influence the entire video, we optimize learnable token embeddings during reverse sampling steps by using gradients from a trained discriminator applied to random frame pairs. This approach allows our method to generate visually coherent video sequences that closely reflect natural motion dynamics, without compromising the fidelity of the generated content. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various models.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://motionprompt.github.io/</p></details> |

By refining and extending user-provided prompts, TIPO bridges the gap between simple inputs and the detailed prompts required for high-quality image generation. Unlike previous approaches that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO adjusts user input prompts with the distribution of a trained prompt dataset, eliminating the need for complex runtime cost via lightweight model. This pre-sampling approach enables efficient and scalable prompt optimization, grounded in the model's training distribution. Experimental results demonstrate TIPO's effectiveness in improving aesthetic scores, reducing image corruption, and better aligning generated images with dataset distributions. These findings highlight the critical role of prompt engineering in T2I systems and open avenues for broader applications of automatic prompt refinement.</p></details> | 26 pages, 19 figures |

However, they often require a larger number of neural function evaluations (NFEs), limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we tackle this problem with Schrodinger Bridges (SBs), which are stochastic differential equations (SDEs) between distributions with minimal transport cost. We analyze the probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) formulation of SBs, and observe that we can decompose its vector field into a linear combination of source predictor, target predictor, and noise predictor. Inspired by this observation, we propose Latent Schrodinger Bridges (LSBs) that approximate the SB ODE via pre-trained Stable Diffusion, and develop appropriate prompt optimization and change of variables formula to match the training and inference between distributions. We demonstrate that our algorithm successfully conduct competitive I2I translation in unsupervised setting with only a fraction of computation cost required by previous DM-based I2I methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACING: Actor-Critic for Instruction Learning in Black-Box Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12736v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks vastly depends on the quality of the instructions, which often require fine-tuning through extensive human effort. This highlights the need for automated instruction optimization; however, this optimization is particularly challenging when dealing with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients remain inaccessible. We propose ACING, a task-specific prompt optimization approach framed as a stateless continuous-action Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, known as the continuum bandit setting. ACING leverages an actor-critic-based method to optimize prompts, learning from non-differentiable reward signals. We validate ACING by optimizing prompts for ChatGPT on 30 instruction-based tasks. ACING consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving a median score improvement of 10 percentage points. Furthermore, ACING not only recovers but also surpasses human-crafted expert instructions, achieving up to a 39 percentage point improvement against human benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Recent works discovered that the performance of LLMs is heavily dependent on the input prompt. However, prompt engineering is usually done manually in a trial-and-error fashion, which can be labor-intensive and challenging in order to find the optimal prompts. To address these problems and unleash the utmost potential of LLMs, we propose a novel LLMs-agnostic framework for prompt optimization, namely GRL-Prompt, which aims to automatically construct optimal prompts via reinforcement learning (RL) in an end-to-end manner. To provide structured action/state representation for optimizing prompts, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) that better encodes the correlation between the user query and candidate in-context examples. Furthermore, a policy network is formulated to generate the optimal action by selecting a set of in-context examples in a rewardable order to construct the prompt. Additionally, the embedding-based reward shaping is utilized to stabilize the RL training process. The experimental results show that GRL-Prompt outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average increase of 0.10 in ROUGE-1, 0.07 in ROUGE-2, 0.07 in ROUGE-L, and 0.05 in BLEU.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11273v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image priors with 3D representation methods, e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to feed-forward generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. An obstacle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end feed-forward approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the spatial feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts. The code is available in the project page.</p></details> |  |

Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations. We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench. Our study offers valuable insights into the application of EAs in LLM-based RSs. Additionally, we explore key components that may influence the overall performance of the RS, providing meaningful guidance for future research on the development of LLM-based EAs in RSs.</p></details> |  |

Therefore the energy consumption of code must be minimized. Code can be generated by large language models. We look at the influence of prompt modification on the energy consumption of the code generated. We use three different Python code problems of varying difficulty levels. Prompt modification is done by adding the sentence ``Give me an energy-optimized solution for this problem'' or by using two Python coding best practices. The large language models used are CodeLlama-70b, CodeLlama-70b-Instruct, CodeLlama-70b-Python, DeepSeek-Coder-33b-base, and DeepSeek-Coder-33b-instruct. We find a decrease in energy consumption for a specific combination of prompt optimization, LLM, and Python code problem. However, no single optimization prompt consistently decreases energy consumption for the same LLM across the different Python code problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Prompt Formatting Have Any Impact on LLM Performance?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10541v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt optimization is crucial for model performance. Although previous research has explored aspects like rephrasing prompt contexts, using various prompting techniques (like in-context learning and chain-of-thought), and ordering few-shot examples, our understanding of LLM sensitivity to prompt templates remains limited. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of different prompt templates on LLM performance. We formatted the same contexts into various human-readable templates, including plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML, and evaluated their impact across tasks like natural language reasoning, code generation, and translation using OpenAI's GPT models. Experiments show that GPT-3.5-turbo's performance varies by up to 40\% in a code translation task depending on the prompt template, while larger models like GPT-4 are more robust to these variations. Our analysis highlights the need to reconsider the use of fixed prompt templates, as different formats can significantly affect model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Self-alignment seeks to reduce these expenses by enabling models to align themselves. To further lower costs and achieve alignment without any expensive tuning or annotations, we introduce a new tuning-free approach for self-alignment, Dynamic Rewarding with Prompt Optimization (DRPO). Our approach leverages a search-based optimization framework that allows LLMs to iteratively self-improve and craft the optimal alignment instructions, all without additional training or human intervention. The core of DRPO is a dynamic rewarding mechanism, which identifies and rectifies model-specific alignment weaknesses, allowing LLMs to adapt efficiently to diverse alignment challenges. Empirical evaluations on eight recent LLMs, both open- and closed-sourced, demonstrate that DRPO significantly enhances alignment performance, with base models outperforming their SFT/RLHF-tuned counterparts. Moreover, the prompts automatically optimized by DRPO surpass those curated by human experts, further validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings highlight the great potential of current LLMs to achieve adaptive self-alignment through inference-time optimization, complementing tuning-based alignment methods.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Main |

However, the lack of in-depth analysis limits the use of this phenomenon for prompt engineering in practice. In this study, we posit that likelihoods serve as an effective gauge for language model performance. Through experiments on two question-answering datasets with a variety of state-of-the-art language models, we reveal correlations between answer accuracy and the likelihood of the question at both the corpus level and the instance level. In addition, we find that question likelihood can also indicate the position of the task-relevant information in the context. Based on these findings, we propose two methods that use question likelihood as a gauge for selecting and constructing prompts that lead to better performance. We demonstrate their effectiveness with experiments. In addition, our likelihood-based methods are efficient, as they only need to compute the likelihood of the input, requiring much fewer language model passes than heuristic prompt engineering methods that require generating responses. Our analysis deepens our understanding of how input prompts affect model performance and provides a promising direction for efficient prompt optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at NAACL 2025.

Recent works utilize feedbacks generated from erroneous cases to guide the prompt optimization. During inference, they may further retrieve several semantically-related exemplars and concatenate them to the optimized prompts to improve the performance. However, those works only utilize the feedback at the current step, ignoring historical and unseleccted feedbacks which are potentially beneficial. Moreover, the selection of exemplars only considers the general semantic relationship and may not be optimal in terms of task performance and matching with the optimized prompt. In this work, we propose an Exemplar-Guided Reflection with Memory mechanism (ERM) to realize more efficient and accurate prompt optimization. Specifically, we design an exemplar-guided reflection mechanism where the feedback generation is additionally guided by the generated exemplars. We further build two kinds of memory to fully utilize the historical feedback information and support more effective exemplar retrieval. Empirical evaluations show our method surpasses previous state-of-the-arts with less optimization steps, i.e., improving F1 score by 10.1 on LIAR dataset, and reducing half of the optimization steps on ProTeGi.</p></details> |  |
| **[SequentialBreak: Large Language Models Can be Fooled by Embedding Jailbreak Prompts into Sequential Prompt Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06426v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the integration of the Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications increases, so does their susceptibility to misuse, raising significant security concerns. Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to assess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks mainly rely on scenario camouflage, prompt obfuscation, prompt optimization, and prompt iterative optimization to conceal malicious prompts. In particular, sequential prompt chains in a single query can lead LLMs to focus on certain prompts while ignoring others, facilitating context manipulation. This paper introduces SequentialBreak, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits this vulnerability. We discuss several scenarios, not limited to examples like Question Bank, Dialog Completion, and Game Environment, where the harmful prompt is embedded within benign ones that can fool LLMs into generating harmful responses. The distinct narrative structures of these scenarios show that SequentialBreak is flexible enough to adapt to various prompt formats beyond those discussed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SequentialBreak uses only a single query to achieve a substantial gain of attack success rate over existing baselines against both open-source and closed-source models. Through our research, we highlight the urgent need for more robust and resilient safeguards to enhance LLM security and prevent potential misuse.

| **[Robust Prompt Optimization for Defending Language Models Against Jailbreaking Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17263v5)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in AI alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries can modify prompts to induce unwanted behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient and General Prompt Optimization via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v3)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar optimization, EO). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO receiving more research attention recently. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and EO techniques both isolation and combination on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars, consistently improves performance on top of IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with EO strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe a synergy between EO and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing the individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar optimization both as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remain a crucial aspect of APO and deserve greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Expan...</summary><p>Expanded version of the NeurIPS 2024 paper</p></details> |

Recently, Vision-Language~(VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers. Experimental results show that our proposed ChatTracker achieves a performance comparable to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedDTPT: Federated Discrete and Transferable Prompt Tuning for Black-Box Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00985v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP). By fine-tuning LLMs with data from specific scenarios, these foundation models can better adapt to various downstream tasks. However, the fine-tuning process poses privacy leakage risks, particularly in centralized data processing scenarios. To address user privacy concerns, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to mitigate the risks associated with centralized data collection from multiple sources. Nevertheless, the privacy of LLMs themselves is equally critical, as potential malicious attacks challenge their security, an issue that has received limited attention in current research. Consequently, establishing a trusted multi-party model fine-tuning environment is essential. Additionally, the local deployment of large LLMs incurs significant storage costs and high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose for the first time a federated discrete and transferable prompt tuning, namely FedDTPT, for black-box large language models. In the client optimization phase, we adopt a token-level discrete prompt optimization method that leverages a feedback loop based on prediction accuracy to drive gradient-free prompt optimization through the MLM API. For server optimization, we employ an attention mechanism based on semantic similarity to filter all local prompt tokens, along with an embedding distance elbow detection and DBSCAN clustering strategy to enhance the filtering process. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves higher accuracy, reduced communication overhead, and robustness to non-iid data in a black-box setting. Moreover, the optimized prompts are transferable.</p></details> |  |

Building on ProTeGi, MAPO uses positive natural language "gradients" and a momentum-based extension to refine prompts effectively. By tracking gradient history, MAPO avoids local minima and oscillations. It also utilizes beam search and an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for balanced candidate expansion and selection. Benchmark testing shows that MAPO achieves faster convergence time with fewer API calls and higher F1 scores than ProTeGi, proving it as a robust and scalable solution for automated prompt engineering in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

AutoDiff frameworks, like PyTorch, enable efficient end-to-end optimization of differentiable systems. However, general computational workflows can be non-differentiable and involve rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). We investigate end-to-end generative optimization -- using generative models such as LLMs within the optimizer for automatic updating of general computational workflows. We discover that workflow execution traces are akin to back-propagated gradients in AutoDiff and can provide key information to interpret feedback for efficient optimization. Formally, we frame a new mathematical setup, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO). In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. We provide a Python library, Trace, that efficiently converts a workflow optimization problem into an OPTO instance using PyTorch-like syntax. Using Trace, we develop a general LLM-based generative optimizer called OptoPrime. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We envision Trace as an open research platform for devising novel generative optimizers and developing the next generation of interactive learning agents.

| **[Fight Back Against Jailbreaking via Prompt Adversarial Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06255v4)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to jailbreaking attacks. Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly focusing on model fine-tuning or heuristical defense designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through prompt optimization remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both grey-box and black-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0%, while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task and incurring only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security.

Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest.

While current methods adopt the paradigm of training a dedicated network end-to-end using labeled image data, they are limited in terms of generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we first present a simple yet well-crafted framework named {\name}, which combines the perception capability of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a modular framework, providing a strong baseline for social relation recognition. Specifically, we instruct VFMs to translate image content into a textual social story, and then utilize LLMs for text-based reasoning. {\name} introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers, as LLMs can generate language-based explanations for the decisions. The manual prompt design process for LLMs at the reasoning phase is tedious and an automated prompt optimization method is desired. As we essentially convert a visual classification task into a generative task of LLMs, automatic prompt optimization encounters a unique long prompt optimization issue. To address this issue, we further propose the Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a greedy search by utilizing gradient information at the segment level. Experimental results show that GSPO significantly improves performance, and our method also generalizes to different image styles.

However, its performance often degrades clearly along the tuning process when the prompts are continuously updated with the test data flow, and the degradation becomes more severe when the domain of test samples changes continuously. We propose HisTPT, a Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning technique that memorizes the useful knowledge of the learnt test samples and enables robust test-time prompt tuning with the memorized knowledge. HisTPT introduces three types of knowledge banks, namely, local knowledge bank, hard-sample knowledge bank, and global knowledge bank, each of which works with different mechanisms for effective knowledge memorization and test-time prompt optimization. In addition, HisTPT features an adaptive knowledge retrieval mechanism that regularizes the prediction of each test sample by adaptively retrieving the memorized knowledge. Extensive experiments show that HisTPT achieves superior prompt tuning performance consistently while handling different visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection) and test samples from continuously changing domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Camera Ready</p></details> |

Past research has focused on optimizing prompts specific to a task. However, much less attention has been given to optimizing the general instructions included in a prompt, known as a system prompt. To address this gap, we propose SPRIG, an edit-based genetic algorithm that iteratively constructs prompts from prespecified components to maximize the model's performance in general scenarios. We evaluate the performance of system prompts on a collection of 47 different types of tasks to ensure generalizability. Our study finds that a single optimized system prompt performs on par with task prompts optimized for each individual task. Moreover, combining system and task-level optimizations leads to further improvement, which showcases their complementary nature. Experiments also reveal that the optimized system prompts generalize effectively across model families, parameter sizes, and languages. This study provides insights into the role of system-level instructions in maximizing LLM potential.</p></details> |  |

However, the recent advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters makes the naive application of traditional FL methods to LLMs impractical due to high computational and communication costs. Furthermore, end users of LLMs often lack access to full architectures and weights of the models, making it impossible for participants to fine-tune these models directly. This paper introduces a novel FL scheme for LLMs, named LanFL, which is purely prompt-based and treats the underlying LLMs as black boxes. We have developed a differentially private synthetic sample generation mechanism to facilitate knowledge sharing among participants, along with a prompt optimization scheme that enables learning from synthetic samples. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LanFL successfully facilitates learning among participants while preserving the privacy of local datasets across various tasks.</p></details> |  |

We utilize recent public collections of user-LLM interactions to construct a natural benchmark called PUPA, which contains personally identifiable information (PII). To study potential approaches, we devise PAPILLON, a multi-stage LLM pipeline that uses prompt optimization to address a simpler version of our task. Our best pipeline maintains high response quality for 85.5% of user queries while restricting privacy leakage to only 7.5%. We still leave a large margin to the generation quality of proprietary LLMs for future work. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/siyan-sylvia-li/PAPILLON.</p></details> |  |

These agent-based systems represent an emerging shift in personal computing. We contribute to the security foundations of agent-based systems and surface a new class of automatically computed obfuscated adversarial prompt attacks that violate the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to an LLM agent. We show how prompt optimization techniques can find such prompts automatically given the weights of a model. We demonstrate that such attacks transfer to production-level agents. For example, we show an information exfiltration attack on Mistral's LeChat agent that analyzes a user's conversation, picks out personally identifiable information, and formats it into a valid markdown command that results in leaking that data to the attacker's server. This attack shows a nearly 80% success rate in an end-to-end evaluation. We conduct a range of experiments to characterize the efficacy of these attacks and find that they reliably work on emerging agent-based systems like Mistral's LeChat, ChatGLM, and Meta's Llama.

Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for thae creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Main Track</p></details> |

However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize the volume of the Pareto reward surface perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce "Survival of the Safest" (SoS), an innovative multi-objective prompt optimization framework that enhances both performance and security in LLMs simultaneously. SoS utilizes an interleaved multi-objective evolution strategy, integrating semantic, feedback, and crossover mutations to effectively traverse the prompt landscape. Differing from the computationally demanding Pareto front methods, SoS provides a scalable solution that expedites optimization in complex, high-dimensional discrete search spaces while keeping computational demands low. Our approach accommodates flexible weighting of objectives and generates a pool of optimized candidates, empowering users to select prompts that optimally meet their specific performance and security needs. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets affirm SoS's efficacy in delivering high performance and notably enhancing safety and security compared to single-objective methods. This advancement marks a significant stride towards the deployment of LLM systems that are both high-performing and secure across varied industrial applications</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |

Unlike black-box predictive models, ABMs excel at explaining the micro-macro linkages that drive such emergent behaviors. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of LLM agents capable of simulating urban activities with unprecedented realism. However, the extreme high computational cost of LLMs presents significant challenges for scaling up the simulations of LLM agents. To address this problem, we propose OpenCity, a scalable simulation platform optimized for both system and prompt efficiencies. Specifically, we propose a LLM request scheduler to reduce communication overhead by parallelizing requests through IO multiplexing. Besides, we deisgn a "group-and-distill" prompt optimization strategy minimizes redundancy by clustering agents with similar static attributes. Through experiments on six global cities, OpenCity achieves a 600-fold acceleration in simulation time per agent, a 70% reduction in LLM requests, and a 50% reduction in token usage. These improvements enable the simulation of 10,000 agents' daily activities in 1 hour on commodity hardware. Besides, the substantial speedup of OpenCity allows us to establish a urban simulation benchmark for LLM agents for the first time, comparing simulated urban activities with real-world data in 6 major cities around the globe. We believe our OpenCity platform provides a critical infrastructure to harness the power of LLMs for interdisciplinary studies in urban space, fostering the collective efforts of broader research communities.

In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning.

While existing prompt optimization methods improve prompt effectiveness, they often lead to prompt drifting, where newly generated prompts can adversely impact previously successful cases while addressing failures. Furthermore, these methods tend to rely heavily on LLMs' intrinsic capabilities for prompt optimization tasks. In this paper, we introduce StraGo (Strategic-Guided Optimization), a novel approach designed to mitigate prompt drifting by leveraging insights from both successful and failed cases to identify critical factors for achieving optimization objectives. StraGo employs a how-to-do methodology, integrating in-context learning to formulate specific, actionable strategies that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for prompt optimization.

While contemporary frontier LLMs are capable enough to power reasonably good Language agents, the closed-API model makes it hard to improve in cases they perform sub-optimally. To address this, recent works have explored ways to improve their performance using techniques like self-reflection and prompt optimization. Unfortunately, techniques like self-reflection can be used only in an online setup, while contemporary prompt optimization techniques are designed and tested to work on simple tasks. To this end, we introduce MetaReflection, a novel offline reinforcement learning technique that enhances the performance of Language Agents by augmenting a semantic memory based on experiential learnings from past trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of MetaReflection by evaluating across multiple domains, including complex logical reasoning, biomedical semantic similarity, open world question answering, and vulnerability threat detection, in Infrastructure-as-Code, spanning different agent designs. MetaReflection boosts Language agents' performance by 4% to 16.82% over the raw GPT-4 baseline and performs on par with existing state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques while requiring fewer LLM calls.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release our experimental code at: https://aka.ms/metareflection-code</p></details> |

However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4\% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA.</p></details> |  |

Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

These compound systems often lack intermediate labels or gradient flow to optimize each module, making their end-to-end optimization challenging. Here we seek strategies to optimize both the module-level LM weights and the associated prompt templates of such systems to maximize a downstream task metric. We propose for the first time combining the weight and prompt optimization strategies to optimize a modular LM pipeline by alternating between the two to get the same LM to teach itself. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification using mistral-7b, llama-2-7b, and llama-3-8b, these BetterTogether strategies optimizing the weights and prompts of a pipeline together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 60% and 6%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks.

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel algorithm for optimizing LM programs. MIPRO outperforms baseline optimizers on five of seven diverse multi-stage LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 13% accuracy.

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST) that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

However, manual prompt engineering is both labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating the need for automated solutions. We introduce PromptWizard, a novel, fully automated framework for discrete prompt optimization, utilizing a self-evolving, self-adapting mechanism. Through a feedback-driven critique and synthesis process, PromptWizard achieves an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, iteratively refining both prompt instructions and in-context examples to generate human-readable, task-specific prompts. This guided approach systematically improves prompt quality, resulting in superior performance across 45 tasks. PromptWizard excels even with limited training data, smaller LLMs, and various LLM architectures.

However, existing approaches make light of the importance of high-quality prompt initialization and the identification of effective optimization directions, thus resulting in substantial optimization steps to obtain satisfactory performance. In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights.

While existing prompt optimization methods automate this process, they rely solely on learning from incorrect samples, leading to a sub-optimal performance. Additionally, an unexplored challenge in the literature is prompts effective for prior models may not perform well on newer versions or different languages. We propose the Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP) framework to address these gaps, enhancing both prompt optimization and adaptation. LCP employs contrastive learning to generate effective prompts by analyzing patterns in good and bad prompt examples. Our evaluation on the Big-Bench Hard dataset shows that LCP has a win rate of over 76% over existing methods in prompt optimization and demonstrates strong adaptability across different model versions, families, and languages.

However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study is a step in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functional code generation, supporting their integration into real-world software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, CCS 2024</p></details> |

While emerging prompt optimizers can automatically refine many of these aspects, we argue that clearly conveying customized requirements (e.g., how to handle diverse inputs) remains a human-centric challenge. In this work, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a study with 30 novices, we show that requirement-focused training doubles novices' prompting performance, significantly outperforming conventional prompt engineering training and prompt optimization. We also demonstrate that high-quality LLM outputs are directly tied to the quality of input requirements.

Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Automating recovery remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods often rely on human intervention to manually address failures or require exhaustive enumeration of failure cases and the design of specific recovery policies for each scenario, both of which are labor-intensive. Foundational Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which demonstrate remarkable common-sense generalization and reasoning capabilities, have broader, potentially unbounded ODDs. However, limitations in spatial reasoning continue to be a common challenge for many VLMs when applied to robot control and motion-level error recovery. In this paper, we investigate how optimizing visual and text prompts can enhance the spatial reasoning of VLMs, enabling them to function effectively as black-box controllers for both motion-level position correction and task-level recovery from unknown failures. Specifically, the optimizations include identifying key visual elements in visual prompts, highlighting these elements in text prompts for querying, and decomposing the reasoning process for failure detection and control generation. In experiments, prompt optimizations significantly outperform pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models in correcting motion-level position errors and improve accuracy by 65.78% compared to VLMs with unoptimized prompts. Additionally, for task-level failures, optimized prompts enhanced the success rate by 5.8%, 5.8%, and 7.5% in VLMs' abilities to detect failures, analyze issues, and generate recovery plans, respectively, across a wide range of unknown errors in Lego assembly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Twice Before Recognizing: Large Multimodal Models for General Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new strategy called think twice before recognizing to improve fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR). Fine-grained TSR in the wild is difficult due to the complex road conditions, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR when data is lacking. Our strategy achieves effective fine-grained TSR by stimulating the multiple-thinking capability of large multimodal models (LMM). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for the LMM. The context descriptions with center coordinate prompt optimization help the LMM to locate the target traffic sign in the original road images containing multiple traffic signs and filter irrelevant answers through the proposed prior traffic sign hypothesis. The characteristic description is based on few-shot in-context learning of template traffic signs, which decreases the cross-domain difference and enhances the fine-grained recognition capability of the LMM. The differential descriptions of similar traffic signs optimize the multimodal thinking capability of the LMM. The proposed method is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art TSR results on all five datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that conversations generated by GPT-4o mini, when used as simulated human participants, systematically differ from those between actual humans across multiple linguistic features. These features include topic variation, lexical attributes, and both the average behavior and diversity (variance) of the language used. To address these discrepancies, we propose an approach that automatically generates prompts for user simulations by incorporating features derived from real human interactions, such as age, gender, emotional tone, and the topics discussed. We assess our approach using differential language analysis combined with deep linguistic inquiry. Our method of prompt optimization, tailored to target specific linguistic features, shows significant improvements. Specifically, it enhances the human-likeness of LLM chatbot conversations, increasing their linguistic diversity. On average, we observe a 54 percent reduction in the error of average features between human and LLM-generated conversations. This method of constructing chatbot sets with human-like diversity holds great potential for enhancing the evaluation process of user-facing bots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Safety Response Boundary of Large Language Models via Unsafe Decoding Path Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10668v3)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are implicit troublemakers. While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |

Existing multimodal fake news detection (MFND) methods can be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are overly dependent on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in QA is often undermined by the vagueness of user questions. To address this issue, we introduce single-round instance-level prompt optimization, referred to as question rewriter. By enhancing the intelligibility of human questions for black-box LLMs, our question rewriter improves the quality of generated answers. The rewriter is optimized using direct preference optimization based on feedback collected from automatic criteria for evaluating generated answers; therefore, its training does not require costly human annotations. The experiments across multiple black-box LLMs and long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. This paper provides a practical framework for training question rewriters and sets a precedent for future explorations in prompt optimization within LFQA tasks.

However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs. In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization (QPO), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM. We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions. Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts. Experiments on various LLM scales and diverse NLP and math tasks demonstrate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of our method in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

| **[Large Language Models Prompting With Episodic Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07465v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization is essential for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in scenarios of few-shot learning where training examples are incorporated directly into the prompt. Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose FUSE (Flexible Unification of Semantic Embeddings), an inexpensive approach to approximating an adapter layer that maps from one model's textual embedding space to another, even across different tokenizers. We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space.

As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024)</p></details> |

However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |

The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |

In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |

Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization.

| **[LangGPT: Rethinking Structured Reusable Prompt Design Framework for LLMs from the Programming Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16929v2)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have demonstrated commendable performance across diverse domains. Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Prompt Program Search: A Structure-Aware Approach to Efficient Compile-Time Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02319v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many modern LLM applications, such as retrieval augmented generation, prompts have become programs themselves. In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |
| **[LoPT: Low-Rank Prompt Tuning for Parameter Efficient Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19486v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In prompt tuning, a prefix or suffix text is added to the prompt, and the embeddings (soft prompts) or token indices (hard prompts) of the prefix/suffix are optimized to gain more control over language models for specific tasks. This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01606v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first gradient-based framework for prompt optimization in text-to-image diffusion models. We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

| **[Autonomous Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11000v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a crucial yet challenging task for optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on customized tasks. This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET), which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts, resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4% increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a significant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16743v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04155v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO. Code and datasets are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/BPO.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |
| **[APEER: Automatic Prompt Engineering Enhances Large Language Model Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14449v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced Information Retrieval (IR) across various modules, such as reranking. Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompts as Auto-Optimized Training Hyperparameters: Training Best-in-Class IR Models from Scratch with 10 Gold Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11706v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a method for training small-scale (under 100M parameter) neural information retrieval models with as few as 10 gold relevance labels. The method depends on generating synthetic queries for documents using a language model (LM), and the key step is that we automatically optimize the LM prompt that is used to generate these queries based on training quality. In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Batch-Instructed Gradient for Prompt Evolution:Systematic Prompt Optimization for Enhanced Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08713v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images from user-provided prompts. Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[POS: A Prompts Optimization Suite for Augmenting Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00949v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper targets to enhance the diffusion-based text-to-video generation by improving the two input prompts, including the noise and the text. Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |
