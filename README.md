| **[Demystifying the Communication Characteristics for Distributed Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10197v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) models based on the transformer architecture have revolutionized many DL applications such as large language models (LLMs), vision transformers, audio generation, and time series prediction. Much of this progress has been fueled by distributed training, yet distributed communication remains a substantial bottleneck to training progress. This paper examines the communication behavior of transformer models - that is, how different parallelism schemes used in multi-node/multi-GPU DL Training communicate data in the context of transformers. We use GPT-based language models as a case study of the transformer architecture due to their ubiquity. We validate the empirical results obtained from our communication logs using analytical models. At a high level, our analysis reveals a need to optimize small message point-to-point communication further, correlations between sequence length, per-GPU throughput, model size, and optimizations used, and where to potentially guide further optimizations in framework and HPC middleware design and optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLUTUS: A Well Pre-trained Large Unified Transformer can Unveil Financial Time Series Regularities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10111v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time series modeling is crucial for understanding and predicting market behaviors but faces challenges such as non-linearity, non-stationarity, and high noise levels. Traditional models struggle to capture complex patterns due to these issues, compounded by limitations in computational resources and model capacity. Inspired by the success of large language models in NLP, we introduce \textbf{PLUTUS}, a \textbf{P}re-trained \textbf{L}arge \textbf{U}nified \textbf{T}ransformer-based model that \textbf{U}nveils regularities in financial time \textbf{S}eries. PLUTUS uses an invertible embedding module with contrastive learning and autoencoder techniques to create an approximate one-to-one mapping between raw data and patch embeddings. TimeFormer, an attention based architecture, forms the core of PLUTUS, effectively modeling high-noise time series. We incorporate a novel attention mechanisms to capture features across both variable and temporal dimensions. PLUTUS is pre-trained on an unprecedented dataset of 100 billion observations, designed to thrive in noisy financial environments. To our knowledge, PLUTUS is the first open-source, large-scale, pre-trained financial time series model with over one billion parameters. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, demonstrating strong transferability and establishing a robust foundational model for finance. Our research provides technical guidance for pre-training financial time series data, setting a new standard in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Day-ahead Electricity Price: Simple Model Save Millions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14893v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate day-ahead electricity price forecasting is essential for residential welfare, yet current methods often fall short in forecast accuracy. We observe that commonly used time series models struggle to utilize the prior correlation between price and demand-supply, which, we found, can contribute a lot to a reliable electricity price forecaster. Leveraging this prior, we propose a simple piecewise linear model that significantly enhances forecast accuracy by directly deriving prices from readily forecastable demand-supply values. Experiments in the day-ahead electricity markets of Shanxi province and ISO New England reveal that such forecasts could potentially save residents millions of dollars a year compared to existing methods. Our findings underscore the value of suitably integrating time series modeling with economic prior for enhanced electricity price forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Unlocking the Power of LSTM for Long Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10006v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recurrent neural network architectures, such as long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM), have historically held a prominent role in time series forecasting (TSF) tasks. While the recently introduced sLSTM for Natural Language Processing (NLP) introduces exponential gating and memory mixing that are beneficial for long term sequential learning, its potential short memory issue is a barrier to applying sLSTM directly in TSF. To address this, we propose a simple yet efficient algorithm named P-sLSTM, which is built upon sLSTM by incorporating patching and channel independence. These modifications substantially enhance sLSTM's performance in TSF, achieving state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justifications for our design, and conduct extensive comparative and analytical experiments to fully validate the efficiency and superior performance of our model.</p></details> |  |
| **[sTransformer: A Modular Approach for Extracting Inter-Sequential and Temporal Information for Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09723v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, numerous Transformer-based models have been applied to long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. However, recent studies with linear models have questioned their effectiveness, demonstrating that simple linear layers can outperform sophisticated Transformer-based models. In this work, we review and categorize existing Transformer-based models into two main types: (1) modifications to the model structure and (2) modifications to the input data. The former offers scalability but falls short in capturing inter-sequential information, while the latter preprocesses time-series data but is challenging to use as a scalable module. We propose $\textbf{sTransformer}$, which introduces the Sequence and Temporal Convolutional Network (STCN) to fully capture both sequential and temporal information. Additionally, we introduce a Sequence-guided Mask Attention mechanism to capture global feature information. Our approach ensures the capture of inter-sequential information while maintaining module scalability. We compare our model with linear models and existing forecasting models on long-term time-series forecasting, achieving new state-of-the-art results. We also conducted experiments on other time-series tasks, achieving strong performance. These demonstrate that Transformer-based structures remain effective and our model can serve as a viable baseline for time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial-Multivariate Model for Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09703v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When solving forecasting problems including multiple time-series features, existing approaches often fall into two extreme categories, depending on whether to utilize inter-feature information: univariate and complete-multivariate models. Unlike univariate cases which ignore the information, complete-multivariate models compute relationships among a complete set of features. However, despite the potential advantage of leveraging the additional information, complete-multivariate models sometimes underperform univariate ones. Therefore, our research aims to explore a middle ground between these two by introducing what we term Partial-Multivariate models where a neural network captures only partial relationships, that is, dependencies within subsets of all features. To this end, we propose PMformer, a Transformer-based partial-multivariate model, with its training algorithm. We demonstrate that PMformer outperforms various univariate and complete-multivariate models, providing a theoretical rationale and empirical analysis for its superiority. Additionally, by proposing an inference technique for PMformer, the forecasting accuracy is further enhanced. Finally, we highlight other advantages of PMformer: efficiency and robustness under missing features.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Deep Learning-based Machine Condition Diagnosis using Short-time Fourier Transformation Variants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09649v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In motor condition diagnosis, electrical current signature serves as an alternative feature to vibration-based sensor data, which is a more expensive and invasive method. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been emerging in diagnosing motor conditions using only motor phase current signals. This study converts time-series motor current signals to time-frequency 2D plots using Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) methods. The motor current signal dataset consists of 3,750 sample points with five classes - one healthy and four synthetically-applied motor fault conditions, and with five loading conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. Five transformation methods are used on the dataset: non-overlap and overlap STFTs, non-overlap and overlap realigned STFTs, and synchrosqueezed STFT. Then, deep learning (DL) models based on the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture are trained and validated from generated plots of each method. The DL models of overlap-STFT, overlap R-STFT, non-overlap STFT, non-overlap R-STFT, and synchrosqueezed-STFT performed exceptionally with an average accuracy of 97.65, 96.03, 96.08, 96.32, and 88.27%, respectively. Four methods outperformed the previous best ML method with 93.20% accuracy, while all five outperformed previous 2D-plot-based methods with accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80%, respectively, using the same dataset, same DL architecture, and validation steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 6 images, submitted to 2024 International Conference on Diagnostics in Electrical Engineering (Diagnostika)</p></details> |
| **[Multiscale Representation Enhanced Temporal Flow Fusion Model for Long-Term Workload Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19697v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate workload forecasting is critical for efficient resource management in cloud computing systems, enabling effective scheduling and autoscaling. Despite recent advances with transformer-based forecasting models, challenges remain due to the non-stationary, nonlinear characteristics of workload time series and the long-term dependencies. In particular, inconsistent performance between long-term history and near-term forecasts hinders long-range predictions. This paper proposes a novel framework leveraging self-supervised multiscale representation learning to capture both long-term and near-term workload patterns. The long-term history is encoded through multiscale representations while the near-term observations are modeled via temporal flow fusion. These representations of different scales are fused using an attention mechanism and characterized with normalizing flows to handle non-Gaussian/non-linear distributions of time series. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '24), October 21--25, 2024, Boise, ID, USA</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Wavelet Transformations for Deep Learning-based Machine Condition Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09644v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) strategies have recently been utilized to diagnose motor faults by simply analyzing motor phase current signals, offering a less costly and non-intrusive alternative to vibration sensors. This research transforms these time-series current signals into time-frequency 2D representations via Wavelet Transform (WT). The dataset for motor current signals includes 3,750 data points across five categories: one representing normal conditions and four representing artificially induced faults, each under five different load conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. The study employs five WT-based techniques: WT-Amor, WT-Bump, WT-Morse, WSST-Amor, and WSST-Bump. Subsequently, five DL models adopting prior Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture were developed and tested using the transformed 2D plots from each method. The DL models for WT-Amor, WT-Bump, and WT-Morse showed remarkable effectiveness with peak model accuracy of 90.93, 89.20, and 93.73%, respectively, surpassing previous 2D-image-based methods that recorded accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80% respectively using the identical dataset and validation protocol. Notably, the WT-Morse approach slightly exceeded the formerly highest ML technique, achieving a 93.20% accuracy. However, the two WSST methods that utilized synchrosqueezing techniques faced difficulty accurately classifying motor faults. The performance of Wavelet-based deep learning methods offers a compelling alternative for machine condition monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 6 figures, submitted to 2024 International Conference on Diagnostics in Electrical Engineering (Diagnostika)</p></details> |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for Time Series Classification and Robust Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07314v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) has recently attracted significant attention as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Despite their theoretical appeal, KAN require validation on large-scale benchmark datasets. Time series data, which has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, especially univariate time series are naturally suited for validating KAN. Therefore, we conducted a fair comparison among KAN, MLP, and mixed structures. The results indicate that KAN can achieve performance comparable to, or even slightly better than, MLP across 128 time series datasets. We also performed an ablation study on KAN, revealing that the output is primarily determined by the base component instead of b-spline function. Furthermore, we assessed the robustness of these models and found that KAN and the hybrid structure MLP\_KAN exhibit significant robustness advantages, attributed to their lower Lipschitz constants. This suggests that KAN and KAN layers hold strong potential to be robust models or to improve the adversarial robustness of other models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figs |
| **[C-Mamba: Channel Correlation Enhanced State Space Models for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05316v2)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, significant progress has been made in multivariate time series forecasting using Linear-based, Transformer-based, and Convolution-based models. However, these approaches face notable limitations: linear forecasters struggle with representation capacities, attention mechanisms suffer from quadratic complexity, and convolutional models have a restricted receptive field. These constraints impede their effectiveness in modeling complex time series, particularly those with numerous variables. Additionally, many models adopt the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy, treating multivariate time series as uncorrelated univariate series while ignoring their correlations. For models considering inter-channel relationships, whether through the self-attention mechanism, linear combination, or convolution, they all incur high computational costs and focus solely on weighted summation relationships, neglecting potential proportional relationships between channels. In this work, we address these issues by leveraging the newly introduced state space model and propose \textbf{C-Mamba}, a novel approach that captures cross-channel dependencies while maintaining linear complexity without losing the global receptive field. Our model consists of two key components: (i) channel mixup, where two channels are mixed to enhance the training sets; (ii) channel attention enhanced patch-wise Mamba encoder that leverages the ability of the state space models to capture cross-time dependencies and models correlations between channels by mining their weight relationships. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven real-world time series datasets. Moreover, the proposed mixup and attention strategy exhibits strong generalizability across other frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Startup Success Predictions in Venture Capital: A GraphRAG Augmented Multivariate Time Series Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09420v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Venture Capital(VC) industry, predicting the success of startups is challenging due to limited financial data and the need for subjective revenue forecasts. Previous methods based on time series analysis or deep learning often fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company relationships such as competition and collaboration. Regarding the issues, we propose a novel approach using GrahphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous models in startup success predictions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first application work of GraphRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.13936, arXiv:2312.04876, arXiv:2402.11454 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Faster Parallel Triangular Maximally Filtered Graphs and Hierarchical Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09399v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Filtered graphs provide a powerful tool for data clustering. The triangular maximally filtered graph (TMFG) method, when combined with the directed bubble hierarchy tree (DBHT) method, defines a useful algorithm for hierarchical data clustering. This combined TMFG-DBHT algorithm has been shown to produce clusters with good accuracy for time series data, but the previous state-of-the-art parallel algorithm has limited parallelism. This paper presents an improved parallel algorithm for TMFG-DBHT. Our algorithm increases the amount of parallelism by aggregating the bulk of the work of TMFG construction together to reduce the overheads of parallelism. Furthermore, our TMFG algorithm updates information lazily, which reduces the overall work. We find further speedups by computing all-pairs shortest paths approximately instead of exactly in DBHT. We show experimentally that our algorithm gives a 3.7--10.7x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art TMFG-DBHT implementation, while preserving clustering accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ridge detection for nonstationary multicomponent signals with time-varying wave-shape functions and its applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06673v2)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel ridge detection algorithm for time-frequency (TF) analysis, particularly tailored for intricate nonstationary time series encompassing multiple non-sinusoidal oscillatory components. The algorithm is rooted in the distinctive geometric patterns that emerge in the TF domain due to such non-sinusoidal oscillations. We term this method \textit{shape-adaptive mode decomposition-based multiple harmonic ridge detection} (\textsf{SAMD-MHRD}). A swift implementation is available when supplementary information is at hand. We demonstrate the practical utility of \textsf{SAMD-MHRD} through its application to a real-world challenge. We employ it to devise a cutting-edge walking activity detection algorithm, leveraging accelerometer signals from an inertial measurement unit across diverse body locations of a moving subject.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Benchmark Time Series Dataset for Semiconductor Fabrication Manufacturing Constructed using Component-based Discrete-Event Simulation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09307v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in high-computing devices increase the necessity for improved and new understanding and development of smart manufacturing factories. Discrete-event models with simulators have been shown to be critical to architect, designing, building, and operating the manufacturing of semiconductor chips. The diffusion, implantation, and lithography machines have intricate processes due to their feedforward and feedback connectivity. The dataset collected from simulations of the factory models holds the promise of generating valuable machine-learning models. As surrogate data-based models, their executions are highly efficient compared to the physics-based counterpart models. For the development of surrogate models, it is beneficial to have publicly available benchmark simulation models that are grounded in factory models that have concise structures and accurate behaviors. Hence, in this research, a dataset is devised and constructed based on a benchmark model of an Intel semiconductor fabrication factory. The model is formalized using the Parallel Discrete-Event System Specification and executed using the DEVS-Suite simulator. The time series dataset is constructed using discrete-event time trajectories. This dataset is further analyzed and used to develop baseline univariate and multivariate machine learning models. The dataset can also be utilized in the machine learning community for behavioral analysis based on formalized and scalable component-based discrete-event models and simulations.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods are usually customized for different analysis tasks and face challenges in tackling practical problems such as partial labeling and domain shift. To improve the performance and address the practical problems universally, we develop UniTS, a novel framework that incorporates self-supervised representation learning (or pre-training). The components of UniTS are designed using sklearn-like APIs to allow flexible extensions. We demonstrate how users can easily perform an analysis task using the user-friendly GUIs, and show the superior performance of UniTS over the traditional task-specific methods without self-supervised pre-training on five mainstream tasks and two practical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGMOD 24</p></details> |
| **[FedST: Secure Federated Shapelet Transformation for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10631v4)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores how to build a shapelet-based time series classification (TSC) model in the federated learning (FL) scenario, that is, using more data from multiple owners without actually sharing the data. We propose FedST, a novel federated TSC framework extended from a centralized shapelet transformation method. We recognize the federated shapelet search step as the kernel of FedST. Thus, we design a basic protocol for the FedST kernel that we prove to be secure and accurate. However, we identify that the basic protocol suffers from efficiency bottlenecks and the centralized acceleration techniques lose their efficacy due to the security issues. To speed up the federated protocol with security guarantee, we propose several optimizations tailored for the FL setting. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed methods are secure and more efficient. We conduct extensive experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Empirical results show that our FedST solution is effective in terms of TSC accuracy, and the proposed optimizations can achieve three orders of magnitude of speedup.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Shapelet-based Framework for Unsupervised Multivariate Time Series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18888v4)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown great promise in unsupervised representation learning (URL) for multivariate time series, because URL has the capability in learning generalizable representation for many downstream tasks without using inaccessible labels. However, existing approaches usually adopt the models originally designed for other domains (e.g., computer vision) to encode the time series data and {rely on strong assumptions to design learning objectives, which limits their ability to perform well}. To deal with these problems, we propose a novel URL framework for multivariate time series by learning time-series-specific shapelet-based representation through a popular contrasting learning paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores the shapelet-based embedding in the unsupervised general-purpose representation learning. A unified shapelet-based encoder and a novel learning objective with multi-grained contrasting and multi-scale alignment are particularly designed to achieve our goal, and a data augmentation library is employed to improve the generalization. We conduct extensive experiments using tens of real-world datasets to assess the representation quality on many downstream tasks, including classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method against not only URL competitors, but also techniques specially designed for downstream tasks. Our code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/real2fish/CSL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024, 14 pages</p></details> |
| **[Time Series Analysis by State Space Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09120v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis by state-space models is widely used in forecasting and extracting unobservable components like level, slope, and seasonality, along with explanatory variables. However, their reliance on traditional Kalman filtering frequently hampers their effectiveness, primarily due to Gaussian assumptions and the absence of efficient subset selection methods to accommodate the multitude of potential explanatory variables in today's big-data applications. Our research introduces the State Space Learning (SSL), a novel framework and paradigm that leverages the capabilities of statistical learning to construct a comprehensive framework for time series modeling and forecasting. By utilizing a regularized high-dimensional regression framework, our approach jointly extracts typical time series unobservable components, detects and addresses outliers, and selects the influence of exogenous variables within a high-dimensional space in polynomial time and global optimality guarantees. Through a controlled numerical experiment, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of subset selection of explanatory variables accuracy compared to relevant benchmarks. We also present an intuitive forecasting scheme and showcase superior performances relative to traditional time series models using a dataset of 48,000 monthly time series from the M4 competition. We extend the applicability of our approach to reformulate any linear state space formulation featuring time-varying coefficients into high-dimensional regularized regressions, expanding the impact of our research to other engineering applications beyond time series analysis. Finally, our proposed methodology is implemented within the Julia open-source package, ``StateSpaceLearning.jl".</p></details> | 22 pages, 28 figures |
| **[RandomNet: Clustering Time Series Using Untrained Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07956v2)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks are widely used in machine learning and data mining. Typically, these networks need to be trained, implying the adjustment of weights (parameters) within the network based on the input data. In this work, we propose a novel approach, RandomNet, that employs untrained deep neural networks to cluster time series. RandomNet uses different sets of random weights to extract diverse representations of time series and then ensembles the clustering relationships derived from these different representations to build the final clustering results. By extracting diverse representations, our model can effectively handle time series with different characteristics. Since all parameters are randomly generated, no training is required during the process. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of the method. To validate its performance, we conduct extensive experiments on all of the 128 datasets in the well-known UCR time series archive and perform statistical analysis of the results. These datasets have different sizes, sequence lengths, and they are from diverse fields. The experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures |

The balancing strategy aimed at reducing covariate disparities between different treatment groups serves as a universal solution. However, when it comes to the time series data, the effectiveness of balancing strategies remains an open question, with a thorough analysis of the robustness and applicability of balancing strategies still lacking. This paper revisits counterfactual estimation in the temporal setting and provides a brief overview of recent advancements in balancing strategies. More importantly, we conduct a critical empirical examination for the effectiveness of the balancing strategies within the realm of temporal counterfactual estimation in various settings on multiple datasets. Our findings could be of significant interest to researchers and practitioners and call for a reexamination of the balancing strategy in time series settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 Carema Ready Version. 20 Pages, 12 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Automated Contrastive Learning Strategy Search for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12641v2)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Contrastive Learning (CL) has become a predominant representation learning paradigm for time series. Most existing methods manually build specific CL Strategies (CLS) by human heuristics for certain datasets and tasks. However, manually developing CLS usually requires excessive prior knowledge about the data, and massive experiments to determine the detailed CL configurations. In this paper, we present an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) practice at Microsoft, which automatically learns CLS for time series datasets and tasks, namely Automated Contrastive Learning (AutoCL). We first construct a principled search space of size over $3\times10^{12}$, covering data augmentation, embedding transformation, contrastive pair construction, and contrastive losses. Further, we introduce an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, which optimizes CLS from the performance on the validation tasks, to obtain effective CLS within the space. Experimental results on various real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoCL could automatically find the suitable CLS for the given dataset and task. From the candidate CLS found by AutoCL on several public datasets/tasks, we compose a transferable Generally Good Strategy (GGS), which has a strong performance for other datasets. We also provide empirical analysis as a guide for the future design of CLS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024</p></details> |
| **[Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11960v2)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various mechanical failures. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024</p></details> |

Unlike conventional test cases that offer a static snapshot of system profile, the designed TX-123BT system incorporates weather-dependent profiles for renewable generation and transmission thermal limits, mimicking the actual Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system characteristics. Three weather-dependent models are used for the creation of wind and solar power production, and dynamic line rating (DLR) separately. Security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) is conducted on TX-123BT daily profiles and numerical results are compared with the actual ERCOT system for validation. The long-term spatio-temporal profiles can greatly capture the renewable production versatility due to the environmental conditions.

Traditional deep learning models, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), enhance beam tracking accuracy however are limited by poor robustness and generalization. In this letter, we use large language models (LLMs) to improve the robustness of beam prediction. By converting time series data into text-based representations and employing the Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP) technique for contextual enrichment, our approach unleashes the strength of LLMs for time series forecasting. Simulation results demonstrate that our LLM-based method offers superior robustness and generalization compared to LSTM-based models, showcasing the potential of LLMs in wireless communications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Generation of Privacy-preserving Synthetic EHR Time Series via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15290v3)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are rich sources of patient-level data, offering valuable resources for medical data analysis. However, privacy concerns often restrict access to EHRs, hindering downstream analysis. Current EHR de-identification methods are flawed and can lead to potential privacy leakage. Additionally, existing publicly available EHR databases are limited, preventing the advancement of medical research using EHR. This study aims to overcome these challenges by generating realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) time series efficiently. We introduce a new method for generating diverse and realistic synthetic EHR time series data using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). We conducted experiments on six databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV (MIMIC-III/IV), the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU), and non-EHR datasets on Stocks and Energy. We compared our proposed method with eight existing methods. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of data fidelity while requiring less training effort. Additionally, data generated by our method yields a lower discriminative accuracy compared to other baseline methods, indicating the proposed method can generate data with less privacy risk. The proposed diffusion-model-based method can reliably and efficiently generate synthetic EHR time series, which facilitates the downstream medical data analysis. Our numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over all other existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the quadratic complexity of Attention makes the vanilla Attention based models hard to apply to long sequence tasks. Various improved Attention structures are proposed to reduce the computation cost by inducing low rankness and approximating the whole sequence by sub-sequences. The most challenging part of those approaches is maintaining the proper balance between information preservation and computation reduction: the longer sub-sequences used, the better information is preserved, but at the price of introducing more noise and computational costs. In this paper, we propose a smoothed skeleton sketching based Attention structure, coined S$^3$Attention, which significantly improves upon the previous attempts to negotiate this trade-off. S$^3$Attention has two mechanisms to effectively minimize the impact of noise while keeping the linear complexity to the sequence length: a smoothing block to mix information over long sequences and a matrix sketching method that simultaneously selects columns and rows from the input matrix. We verify the effectiveness of S$^3$Attention both theoretically and empirically. Extensive studies over Long Range Arena (LRA) datasets and six time-series forecasting show that S$^3$Attention significantly outperforms both vanilla Attention and other state-of-the-art variants of Attention structures.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DeepClair, a novel framework for portfolio selection. DeepClair leverages a transformer-based time-series forecasting model to predict market trends, facilitating more informed and adaptable portfolio decisions. To integrate the forecasting model into a deep reinforcement learning-driven portfolio selection framework, we introduced a two-step strategy: first, pre-training the time-series model on market data, followed by fine-tuning the portfolio selection architecture using this model. Additionally, we investigated the optimization technique, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance the pre-trained forecasting model for fine-tuning in investment scenarios. This work bridges market forecasting and portfolio selection, facilitating the advancement of investment strategies.</p></details> | CIKM 2024 Accepted |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Learning Based Physics-Informed Temporal Networks for Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08488v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data mining is immensely important in extensive applications, such as traffic, medical, and e-commerce. In this paper, we focus on medical temporal variation modeling, \emph{i.e.,} cuffless blood pressure (BP) monitoring which has great value in cardiovascular healthcare. Although providing a comfortable user experience, such methods are suffering from the demand for a significant amount of realistic data to train an individual model for each subject, especially considering the invasive or obtrusive BP ground-truth measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel physics-informed temporal network~(PITN) with adversarial contrastive learning to enable precise BP estimation with very limited data. Specifically, we first enhance the physics-informed neural network~(PINN) with the temporal block for investigating BP dynamics' multi-periodicity for personal cardiovascular cycle modeling and temporal variation. We then employ adversarial training to generate extra physiological time series data, improving PITN's robustness in the face of sparse subject-specific training data. Furthermore, we utilize contrastive learning to capture the discriminative variations of cardiovascular physiologic phenomena. This approach aggregates physiological signals with similar blood pressure values in latent space while separating clusters of samples with dissimilar blood pressure values. Experiments on three widely-adopted datasets with different modailties (\emph{i.e.,} bioimpedance, PPG, millimeter-wave) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed methods over previous state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at~\url{https://github.com/Zest86/ACL-PITN}.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Typical choices for activation functions are ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid etc., where the choice generally depends on the application domain. In this work, we propose a framework/strategy that unifies several works on activation functions and theoretically explains the performance benefits of these works. We also propose novel techniques that originate from the framework and allow us to obtain ``extensions'' (i.e. special generalizations of a given neural network) of neural networks through operations on activation functions. We theoretically and empirically show that ``extensions'' of neural networks have performance benefits compared to vanilla neural networks with insignificant space and time complexity costs on standard test functions. We also show the benefits of neural network ``extensions'' in the time-series domain on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

The results demonstrate the algorithm we developed can detect anomalies which correspond to powertrain faults by learning patterns in the multivariate time-series data of hybrid-electric vehicle powertrain sensors. Data was collected by engineers at Ford Motor Company from numerous sensors over several drive cycle variations. This study provides evidence of the anomaly detecting capability of our trained autoencoder and investigates the suitability of our autoencoder relative to other unsupervised methods for automatic fault detection in this data set. Preliminary results of testing the autoencoder on the powertrain sensor data indicate the data reconstruction approach availed by the autoencoder is a robust technique for identifying the abnormal sequences in the multivariate series. These results support that irregularities in hybrid-electric vehicles' powertrains are conveyed via sensor signals in the embedded electronic communication system, and therefore can be identified mechanistically with a trained algorithm. Additional unsupervised methods are tested and show the autoencoder performs better at fault detection than outlier detectors and other novel deep learning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>SSCI2...</summary><p>SSCI2022, 7 pages, 3 Tables, 3 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Anytime-valid off-policy inference for contextual bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10768v3)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual bandit algorithms are ubiquitous tools for active sequential experimentation in healthcare and the tech industry. They involve online learning algorithms that adaptively learn policies over time to map observed contexts $X_t$ to actions $A_t$ in an attempt to maximize stochastic rewards $R_t$. This adaptivity raises interesting but hard statistical inference questions, especially counterfactual ones: for example, it is often of interest to estimate the properties of a hypothetical policy that is different from the logging policy that was used to collect the data -- a problem known as ``off-policy evaluation'' (OPE). Using modern martingale techniques, we present a comprehensive framework for OPE inference that relax unnecessary conditions made in some past works, significantly improving on them both theoretically and empirically. Importantly, our methods can be employed while the original experiment is still running (that is, not necessarily post-hoc), when the logging policy may be itself changing (due to learning), and even if the context distributions are a highly dependent time-series (such as if they are drifting over time). More concretely, we derive confidence sequences for various functionals of interest in OPE. These include doubly robust ones for time-varying off-policy mean reward values, but also confidence bands for the entire cumulative distribution function of the off-policy reward distribution. All of our methods (a) are valid at arbitrary stopping times (b) only make nonparametric assumptions, (c) do not require importance weights to be uniformly bounded and if they are, we do not need to know these bounds, and (d) adapt to the empirical variance of our estimators. In summary, our methods enable anytime-valid off-policy inference using adaptively collected contextual bandit data.</p></details> | 43 pages, 6 figures |
| **[An Efficient and Explainable Transformer-Based Few-Shot Learning for Modeling Electricity Consumption Profiles Across Thousands of Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08399v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity Consumption Profiles (ECPs) are crucial for operating and planning power distribution systems, especially with the increasing numbers of various low-carbon technologies such as solar panels and electric vehicles. Traditional ECP modeling methods typically assume the availability of sufficient ECP data. However, in practice, the accessibility of ECP data is limited due to privacy issues or the absence of metering devices. Few-shot learning (FSL) has emerged as a promising solution for ECP modeling in data-scarce scenarios. Nevertheless, standard FSL methods, such as those used for images, are unsuitable for ECP modeling because (1) these methods usually assume several source domains with sufficient data and several target domains. However, in the context of ECP modeling, there may be thousands of source domains with a moderate amount of data and thousands of target domains. (2) Standard FSL methods usually involve cumbersome knowledge transfer mechanisms, such as pre-training and fine-tuning, whereas ECP modeling requires more lightweight methods. (3) Deep learning models often lack explainability, hindering their application in industry. This paper proposes a novel FSL method that exploits Transformers and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for ECP modeling to address the above-described issues. Results show that our method can accurately restore the complex ECP distribution with a minimal amount of ECP data (e.g., only 1.6\% of the complete domain dataset) while it outperforms state-of-the-art time series modeling methods, maintaining the advantages of being both lightweight and interpretable. The project is open-sourced at https://github.com/xiaweijie1996/TransformerEM-GMM.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of High-dimensional Time Series in Spectral Domain using Explainable Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08388v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretable classification of time series presents significant challenges in high dimensions. Traditional feature selection methods in the frequency domain often assume sparsity in spectral density matrices (SDMs) or their inverses, which can be restrictive for real-world applications. In this article, we propose a model-based approach for classifying high-dimensional stationary time series by assuming sparsity in the difference between inverse SDMs. Our approach emphasizes the interpretability of model parameters, making it especially suitable for fields like neuroscience, where understanding differences in brain network connectivity across various states is crucial. The estimators for model parameters demonstrate consistency under appropriate conditions. We further propose using standard deep learning optimizers for parameter estimation, employing techniques such as mini-batching and learning rate scheduling. Additionally, we introduce a method to screen the most discriminatory frequencies for classification, which exhibits the sure screening property under general conditions. The flexibility of the proposed model allows the significance of covariates to vary across frequencies, enabling nuanced inferences and deeper insights into the underlying problem. The novelty of our method lies in the interpretability of the model parameters, addressing critical needs in neuroscience. The proposed approaches have been evaluated on simulated examples and the `Alert-vs-Drowsy' EEG dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Time-Dependent Methods and Seasonal Effects in Code Technical Debt Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08095v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Technical Debt prediction has become a popular research niche in recent software engineering literature. Technical Debt is an important metric in software projects as it measures professionals' effort to clean the code. Therefore, predicting its future behavior becomes a crucial task. However, no well-defined and consistent approach can completely capture the features that impact the evolution of Code Technical Debt. The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of considering time-dependent techniques as well as seasonal effects in temporal data in the prediction performance within the context of Code Technical Debt. The study adopts existing, yet not extensively adopted, time-dependent prediction techniques and compares their prediction performance to commonly used Machine Learning models. Further, the study strengthens the evaluation of time-dependent methods by extending the analysis to capture the impact of seasonality in Code Technical Debt data. We trained 11 prediction models using the commit history of 31 open-source projects developed with Java. We predicted the future observations of the SQALE index to evaluate their predictive performance. Our study confirms the positive impact of considering time-dependent techniques. The adopted multivariate time series analysis model ARIMAX overcame the rest of the adopted models. Incorporating seasonal effects led to an enhancement in the predictive performance of the adopted time-dependent techniques. However, the impact of this effect was found to be relatively modest. The findings of this study corroborate our position in favor of implementing techniques that capture the existing time dependence within historical data of software metrics, specifically in the context of this study, namely, Code Technical Debt. This necessitates the utilization of techniques that can effectively address this evidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universality of Real Minimal Complexity Reservoir](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08071v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir Computing (RC) models, a subclass of recurrent neural networks, are distinguished by their fixed, non-trainable input layer and dynamically coupled reservoir, with only the static readout layer being trained. This design circumvents the issues associated with backpropagating error signals through time, thereby enhancing both stability and training efficiency. RC models have been successfully applied across a broad range of application domains. Crucially, they have been demonstrated to be universal approximators of time-invariant dynamic filters with fading memory, under various settings of approximation norms and input driving sources. Simple Cycle Reservoirs (SCR) represent a specialized class of RC models with a highly constrained reservoir architecture, characterized by uniform ring connectivity and binary input-to-reservoir weights with an aperiodic sign pattern. For linear reservoirs, given the reservoir size, the reservoir construction has only one degree of freedom -- the reservoir cycle weight. Such architectures are particularly amenable to hardware implementations without significant performance degradation in many practical tasks. In this study we endow these observations with solid theoretical foundations by proving that SCRs operating in real domain are universal approximators of time-invariant dynamic filters with fading memory. Our results supplement recent research showing that SCRs in the complex domain can approximate, to arbitrary precision, any unrestricted linear reservoir with a non-linear readout. We furthermore introduce a novel method to drastically reduce the number of SCR units, making such highly constrained architectures natural candidates for low-complexity hardware implementations. Our findings are supported by empirical studies on real-world time series datasets.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Causal Discovery from Time-Series Data with Short-Term Invariance-Based Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08023v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery from time-series data aims to capture both intra-slice (contemporaneous) and inter-slice (time-lagged) causality between variables within the temporal chain, which is crucial for various scientific disciplines. Compared to causal discovery from non-time-series data, causal discovery from time-series data necessitates more serialized samples with a larger amount of observed time steps. To address the challenges, we propose a novel gradient-based causal discovery approach STIC, which focuses on \textbf{S}hort-\textbf{T}erm \textbf{I}nvariance using \textbf{C}onvolutional neural networks to uncover the causal relationships from time-series data. Specifically, STIC leverages both the short-term time and mechanism invariance of causality within each window observation, which possesses the property of independence, to enhance sample efficiency. Furthermore, we construct two causal convolution kernels, which correspond to the short-term time and mechanism invariance respectively, to estimate the window causal graph. To demonstrate the necessity of convolutional neural networks for causal discovery from time-series data, we theoretically derive the equivalence between convolution and the underlying generative principle of time-series data under the assumption that the additive noise model is identifiable. Experimental evaluations conducted on both synthetic and FMRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STIC outperforms baselines significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, particularly when the datasets contain a limited number of observed time steps.

| **[Hedge Fund Portfolio Construction Using PolyModel Theory and iTransformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03320v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When constructing portfolios, a key problem is that a lot of financial time series data are sparse, making it challenging to apply machine learning methods. Polymodel theory can solve this issue and demonstrate superiority in portfolio construction from various aspects. To implement the PolyModel theory for constructing a hedge fund portfolio, we begin by identifying an asset pool, utilizing over 10,000 hedge funds for the past 29 years' data. PolyModel theory also involves choosing a wide-ranging set of risk factors, which includes various financial indices, currencies, and commodity prices. This comprehensive selection mirrors the complexities of the real-world environment. Leveraging on the PolyModel theory, we create quantitative measures such as Long-term Alpha, Long-term Ratio, and SVaR. We also use more classical measures like the Sharpe ratio or Morningstar's MRAR. To enhance the performance of the constructed portfolio, we also employ the latest deep learning techniques (iTransformer) to capture the upward trend, while efficiently controlling the downside, using all the features. The iTransformer model is specifically designed to address the challenges in high-dimensional time series forecasting and could largely improve our strategies. More precisely, our strategies achieve better Sharpe ratio and annualized return. The above process enables us to create multiple portfolio strategies aiming for high returns and low risks when compared to various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[System States Forecasting of Microservices with Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07894v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) era, accurately forecasting system states is crucial. In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

| **[Incremental Structure Discovery of Classification via Sequential Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07875v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a powerful framework for making predictions and understanding uncertainty for classification with kernels and Bayesian non-parametric learning. Building such models typically requires strong prior knowledge to define preselect kernels, which could be ineffective for online applications of classification that sequentially process data because features of data may shift during the process. To alleviate the requirement of prior knowledge used in GPs and learn new features from data that arrive successively, this paper presents a novel method to automatically discover models of classification on complex data with little prior knowledge. Our method adapts a recently proposed technique for GP-based time-series structure discovery, which integrates GPs and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We extend the technique to handle extra latent variables in GP classification, such that our method can effectively and adaptively learn a-priori unknown structures of classification from continuous input. In addition, our method adapts new batch of data with updated structures of models. Our experiments show that our method is able to automatically incorporate various features of kernels on synthesized data and real-world data for classification. In the experiments of real-world data, our method outperforms various classification methods on both online and offline setting achieving a 10\% accuracy improvement on one benchmark.</p></details> |  |

For instance, in medicine, effective analysis of diverse physiological signals is crucial for patient monitoring and clinical decision-making and yet highly challenging. We introduce MedTsLLM, a general multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that effectively integrates time series data and rich contextual information in the form of text to analyze physiological signals, performing three tasks with clinical relevance: semantic segmentation, boundary detection, and anomaly detection in time series. These critical tasks enable deeper analysis of physiological signals and can provide actionable insights for clinicians. We utilize a reprogramming layer to align embeddings of time series patches with a pretrained LLM's embedding space and make effective use of raw time series, in conjunction with textual context. Given the multivariate nature of medical datasets, we develop methods to handle multiple covariates. We additionally tailor the text prompt to include patient-specific information. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including deep learning models, other LLMs, and clinical methods across multiple medical domains, specifically electrocardiograms and respiratory waveforms. MedTsLLM presents a promising step towards harnessing the power of LLMs for medical time series analysis that can elevate data-driven tools for clinicians and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, MLHC 2024</p></details> |

Active management of CLPU is becoming an essential tool for distribution system operators who seek to defer network upgrades and speed up post-outage customer restoration. One key functionality needed for actively managing CLPU is its forecast at various scales. The widespread deployment of smart metering devices is also opening up new opportunities for data-driven load modeling and forecast. In this paper, we propose an approach for customer-side estimation of CLPU using time-stamped local load measurements. The proposed method uses Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling for short-term foregone energy consumption forecast during an outage. Forecasts are made on an hourly basis to estimate the energy to potentially recover after outages lasting up to several hours. Moreover, to account for changing customer behavior and weather, the model order is adjusted dynamically. Simulation results based on actual smart meter measurements are presented for 50 residential customers over the duration of one year. These results are validated using physical modeling of residential loads and are shown to match well the ARIMA-based forecasts. Additionally, accuracy and execution speed has been compared with other state-of-the-art approaches for time-series forecasting including Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES). ARIMA-based forecast is found to offer superior performance both in terms of accuracy and computation speed.</p></details> |  |

The majority of the world's freshwater resources have inadequate monitoring of critical environmental variables needed for management. Yet, the need to have widespread predictions of hydrological variables such as river flow and water quality has become increasingly urgent due to climate and land use change over the past decades, and their associated impacts on water resources. Modern machine learning methods increasingly outperform their process-based and empirical model counterparts for hydrologic time series prediction with their ability to extract information from large, diverse data sets. We review relevant state-of-the art applications of machine learning for streamflow, water quality, and other water resources prediction and discuss opportunities to improve the use of machine learning with emerging methods for incorporating watershed characteristics into deep learning models, transfer learning, and incorporating process knowledge into machine learning models. The analysis here suggests most prior efforts have been focused on deep learning learning frameworks built on many sites for predictions at daily time scales in the United States, but that comparisons between different classes of machine learning methods are few and inadequate. We identify several open questions for time series predictions in unmonitored sites that include incorporating dynamic inputs and site characteristics, mechanistic understanding and spatial context, and explainable AI techniques in modern machine learning frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, Accepted to Environmental Data Science</p></details> |

The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |

Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field.

Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</p></details> |  |

However, their application to time series data, a crucial component in many domains, remains limited. This paper proposes LiPCoT (Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for time series), a novel tokenizer that encodes time series data into a sequence of tokens, enabling self-supervised learning of time series using existing Language model architectures such as BERT. Unlike traditional time series tokenizers that rely heavily on CNN encoder for time series feature generation, LiPCoT employs stochastic modeling through linear predictive coding to create a latent space for time series providing a compact yet rich representation of the inherent stochastic nature of the data. Furthermore, LiPCoT is computationally efficient and can effectively handle time series data with varying sampling rates and lengths, overcoming common limitations of existing time series tokenizers. In this proof-of-concept work, we present the effectiveness of LiPCoT in classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) using an EEG dataset from 46 participants. In particular, we utilize LiPCoT to encode EEG data into a small vocabulary of tokens and then use BERT for self-supervised learning and the downstream task of PD classification. We benchmark our approach against several state-of-the-art CNN-based deep learning architectures for PD detection. Our results reveal that BERT models utilizing self-supervised learning outperformed the best-performing existing method by 7.1% in precision, 2.3% in recall, 5.5% in accuracy, 4% in AUC, and 5% in F1-score highlighting the potential for self-supervised learning even on small datasets. Our work will inform future foundational models for time series, particularly for self-supervised learning.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Most existing performance assessments of LLMs for spatial tasks have primarily focused on ChatGPT, whereas other chatbots received less attention. To narrow this research gap, this study conducts a zero-shot correctness evaluation for a set of 76 spatial tasks across seven task categories assigned to four prominent chatbots, i.e., ChatGPT-4, Gemini, Claude-3, and Copilot. The chatbots generally performed well on tasks related to spatial literacy, GIS theory, and interpretation of programming code and functions, but revealed weaknesses in mapping, code writing, and spatial reasoning. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in correctness of results between the four chatbots. Responses from repeated tasks assigned to each chatbot showed a high level of consistency in responses with matching rates of over 80% for most task categories in the four chatbots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions in GIS</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Pre-Trained Transformers for Heart Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20775v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoder-only transformers are the backbone of the popular generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series of large language models. In this work, we employ this framework to the analysis of clinical heart time-series data, to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, termed PPG-PT and ECG-PT. We place a special emphasis on making both such pre-trained models fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that, in order to make predictions, the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, we show that tokens with the same value, which occur at different distinct points in the electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space. The clusters form according to phase, as the tokens propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in PPG and the P-wave in ECG. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models are straightforward to fine-tune for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation (AF), and beat detection in photoplethysmography. For the example of AF, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved the respective leave-one-subject-out AUCs of 0.99 and 0.93 for ECG and PPG within the MIMIC Perform AF dataset. In addition, the fine-tuned beat detector achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score of 98%, as well as uniquely providing a beat confidence level which acts as a signal quality estimator. Importantly, the fine-tuned models for AF screening are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach for time series generation, emphasizing diverse synthesis scenarios based on historical or correlated time series data streams. Since time series have unique characteristics, such as fixed time order and data scaling, standard Gaussian prior might be ill-suited for general time series generation. In this paper, we exploit the usage of diverse prior distributions for synthesis. Then, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that enables flexible synthesis by leveraging diffusion bridges to learn the transport between chosen prior and data distributions. Our model covers a wide range of scenarios in time series diffusion models, which leverages (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional synthesis, and (ii) data-scale preserving synthesis with a constraint as a prior for conditional generation. Experimentally, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both unconditional and conditional time series generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite reducing overfitting risks, these methods miss potential opportunities in utilizing channel dependence for accurate predictions. We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, i.e., some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. In this paper, we propose a new method named LIFT that first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. LIFT plays as a plugin that can be seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that LIFT improves the state-of-the-art methods by 5.5% in average forecasting performance.

Despite the reported improvements in several papers, the practical application of these models remains limited. Recent studies have cast doubt on these models, attributing their results to flawed evaluation techniques. However, the impact of initialization has largely been overlooked. This paper provides a critical analysis of the initialization effects on TSAD model performance. Our extensive experiments reveal that TSAD models are highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as window size, seed number, and normalization. This sensitivity often leads to significant variability in performance, which can be exploited to artificially inflate the reported efficacy of these models. We demonstrate that even minor changes in initialization parameters can result in performance variations that overshadow the claimed improvements from novel model architectures. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous evaluation protocols and transparent reporting of preprocessing steps to ensure the reliability and fairness of anomaly detection methods. This paper calls for a more cautious interpretation of TSAD advancements and encourages the development of more robust and transparent evaluation practices to advance the field and its practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional kernel-based methods, despite their theoretical soundness and numerical efficiency, frequently struggle with selecting optimal base kernels and parameter tuning, especially with gradient-based methods prone to local optima. KSOS mitigates these issues by leveraging a global optimization framework with kernel-based surrogate functions, thereby achieving more reliable and precise learning of dynamical systems. Through comprehensive numerical experiments on the Logistic Map, Henon Map, and Lorentz System, KSOS is shown to consistently outperform gradient descent in minimizing the relative-$\rho$ metric and improving kernel accuracy. These results highlight KSOS's effectiveness in predicting the behavior of chaotic dynamical systems, demonstrating its capability to adapt kernels to underlying dynamics and enhance the robustness and predictive power of kernel-based approaches, making it a valuable asset for time series analysis in various scientific fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Dynamical Operator: Continuous Spatial-Temporal Model with Gradient-Based and Derivative-Free Optimization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11798v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven modeling techniques have been explored in the spatial-temporal modeling of complex dynamical systems for many engineering applications. However, a systematic approach is still lacking to leverage the information from different types of data, e.g., with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the combined use of short-term trajectories and long-term statistics. In this work, we build on the recent progress of neural operator and present a data-driven modeling framework called neural dynamical operator that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the neural dynamical operator is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations, without demanding abundant training data in different temporal resolutions. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the neural dynamical operator with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data.</p></details> |  |

This overlooks the inherent characteristic of time-series data containing both time and frequency features. In this work, we present Spectral eXplanation (SpectralX), an XAI framework that provides time-frequency explanations for time-series black-box classifiers. This easily adaptable framework enables users to "plug-in" various perturbation-based XAI methods for any pre-trained time-series classification models to assess their impact on the explanation quality without having to modify the framework architecture. Additionally, we introduce Feature Importance Approximations (FIA), a new perturbation-based XAI method. These methods consist of feature insertion, deletion, and combination techniques to enhance computational efficiency and class-specific explanations in time-series classification tasks. We conduct extensive experiments in the generated synthetic dataset and various UCR Time-Series datasets to first compare the explanation performance of FIA and other existing perturbation-based XAI methods in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, and then show the superiority of our FIA in the time-frequency domain with the SpectralX framework. Finally, we conduct a user study to confirm the practicality of our FIA in SpectralX framework for class-specific time-frequency based time-series explanations.

There are very few quantitative evaluation methodologies and even fewer examples of actionable explanation, where the explanation methods are shown to objectively improve specific computational tasks on time series data. In this paper we focus on analyzing InterpretTime, a recent evaluation methodology for attribution methods applied to MTSC. We showcase some significant weaknesses of the original methodology and propose ideas to improve both its accuracy and efficiency. Unlike related work, we go beyond evaluation and also showcase the actionability of the produced explainer ranking, by using the best attribution methods for the task of channel selection in MTSC. We find that perturbation-based methods such as SHAP and Feature Ablation work well across a set of datasets, classifiers and tasks and outperform gradient-based methods. We apply the best ranked explainers to channel selection for MTSC and show significant data size reduction and improved classifier accuracy.</p></details> |  |

This progress has inspired a series of innovative studies that explore the adaptation of PLMs to time series analysis, intending to create a unified foundation model that addresses various time series analytical tasks. However, these efforts predominantly focus on Regularly Sampled Time Series (RSTS), neglecting the unique challenges posed by Irregularly Sampled Time Series (ISTS), which are characterized by non-uniform sampling intervals and prevalent missing data. To bridge this gap, this work explores the potential of PLMs for ISTS analysis. We begin by investigating the effect of various methods for representing ISTS, aiming to maximize the efficacy of PLMs in this under-explored area. Furthermore, we present a unified PLM-based framework, ISTS-PLM, which integrates time-aware and variable-aware PLMs tailored for comprehensive intra and inter-time series modeling and includes a learnable input embedding layer and a task-specific output layer to tackle diverse ISTS analytical tasks. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate that the ISTS-PLM, utilizing a simple yet effective series-based representation for ISTS, consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various analytical tasks, such as classification, interpolation, and extrapolation, as well as few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios, spanning scientific domains like healthcare and biomechanics.</p></details> |  |

Simulated data can be used in downstream tasks by augmenting datasets for signal searches, balancing data sets for machine learning, and validating detection schemes. In this work, we present Conditional Derivative GAN (cDVGAN), a novel conditional model in the Generative Adversarial Network framework for simulating multiple classes of time-domain observations that represent gravitational waves (GWs) and detector glitches. cDVGAN can also generate generalized hybrid samples that span the variation between classes through interpolation in the conditioned class vector. cDVGAN introduces an additional player into the typical 2-player adversarial game of GANs, where an auxiliary discriminator analyzes the first-order derivative time-series. Our results show that this provides synthetic data that better captures the features of the original data. cDVGAN conditions on three classes, two denoised from LIGO blip and tomte glitch events from its 3rd observing run (O3), and the third representing binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Our proposed cDVGAN outperforms 4 different baseline GAN models in replicating the features of the three classes. Specifically, our experiments show that training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with our cDVGAN-generated data improves the detection of samples embedded in detector noise beyond the synthetic data from other state-of-the-art GAN models. Our best synthetic dataset yields as much as a 4.2% increase in area-under-the-curve (AUC) performance compared to synthetic datasets from baseline GANs. Moreover, training the CNN with hybrid samples from our cDVGAN outperforms CNNs trained only on the standard classes, when identifying real samples embedded in LIGO detector background (4% AUC improvement for cDVGAN).</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Notwithstanding the relevance of this topic in numerous application fields, a comprehensive and extensive evaluation of recent state-of-the-art techniques taking into account real-world constraints is still needed. Some efforts have been made to compare existing unsupervised time-series anomaly detection methods rigorously. However, only standard performance metrics, namely precision, recall, and F1-score are usually considered. Essential aspects for assessing their practical relevance are therefore neglected. This paper proposes an in-depth evaluation study of recent unsupervised anomaly detection techniques in time-series. Instead of relying solely on standard performance metrics, additional yet informative metrics and protocols are taken into account. In particular, (i) more elaborate performance metrics specifically tailored for time-series are used; (ii) the model size and the model stability are studied; (iii) an analysis of the tested approaches with respect to the anomaly type is provided; and (iv) a clear and unique protocol is followed for all experiments. Overall, this extensive analysis aims to assess the maturity of state-of-the-art time-series anomaly detection, give insights regarding their applicability under real-world setups and provide to the community a more complete evaluation protocol.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |

The emergence of LTSF-Linear, with its straightforward linear architecture, has notably outperformed transformer-based counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of the transformer's utility in time series forecasting. In response, this paper presents an adaptation of a recent architecture termed extended LSTM (xLSTM) for LTSF. xLSTM incorporates exponential gating and a revised memory structure with higher capacity that has good potential for LTSF. Our adopted architecture for LTSF termed as xLSTMTime surpasses current approaches. We compare xLSTMTime's performance against various state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world da-tasets, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities.

The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Are Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07820v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023.

Current pre-training methods are limited in either unidirectional next-token prediction or randomly masked token prediction. We propose a novel architecture called Bidirectional Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (BiTimelyGPT), which pre-trains on biosignals and longitudinal clinical records by both next-token and previous-token prediction in alternating transformer layers. This pre-training task preserves original distribution and data shapes of the time-series. Additionally, the full-rank forward and backward attention matrices exhibit more expressive representation capabilities. Using biosignals and longitudinal clinical records, BiTimelyGPT demonstrates superior performance in predicting neurological functionality, disease diagnosis, and physiological signs. By visualizing the attention heatmap, we observe that the pre-trained BiTimelyGPT can identify discriminative segments from biosignal time-series sequences, even more so after fine-tuning on the task.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging recent techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 18 figures. v2: updated funding acknowledgements</p></details> |

The traditional two-stage approach, which handles imputation and classification separately, can result in sub-optimal performance as label information is not utilized in the imputation process. On the other hand, a one-stage approach can learn features under missing information, but feature representation is limited as imputed errors are propagated in the classification process. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end neural network that unifies data imputation and representation learning within a single framework, allowing the imputation process to take advantage of label information. Differing from previous methods, our approach places less emphasis on the accuracy of imputation data and instead prioritizes classification performance. A specifically designed multi-scale feature learning module is implemented to extract useful information from the noise-imputation data. The proposed model is evaluated on 68 univariate time series datasets from the UCR archive, as well as a multivariate time series dataset with various missing data ratios and 4 real-world datasets with missing information. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for incomplete time series classification, particularly in scenarios with high levels of missing data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Learning of Nonlinear Independent Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05788v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the causal relations between interested variables plays a pivotal role in representation learning as it provides deep insights into the dataset. Identifiability, as the central theme of this approach, normally hinges on leveraging data from multiple distributions (intervention, distribution shift, time series, etc.). Despite the exciting development in this field, a practical but often overlooked problem is: what if those distribution shifts happen sequentially? In contrast, any intelligence possesses the capacity to abstract and refine learned knowledge sequentially -- lifelong learning. In this paper, with a particular focus on the nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) framework, we move one step forward toward the question of enabling models to learn meaningful (identifiable) representations in a sequential manner, termed continual causal representation learning. We theoretically demonstrate that model identifiability progresses from a subspace level to a component-wise level as the number of distributions increases. Empirically, we show that our method achieves performance comparable to nonlinear ICA methods trained jointly on multiple offline distributions and, surprisingly, the incoming new distribution does not necessarily benefit the identification of all latent variables.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 Figures |
| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

This study aims to investigate the capability of i) Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NG-RC) ii) Reservoir Computing (RC) iii) Long short-term Memory (LSTM) for predicting chaotic system behavior, and to compare their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. These methods are applied to predict time series obtained from four representative chaotic systems including Lorenz, R\"ossler, Chen, Qi systems. In conclusion, we found that NG-RC is more computationally efficient and offers greater potential for predicting chaotic system behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Causal Representation Learning from Multiple Distributions: A General Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05052v3)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many problems, the measured variables (e.g., image pixels) are just mathematical functions of the latent causal variables (e.g., the underlying concepts or objects). For the purpose of making predictions in changing environments or making proper changes to the system, it is helpful to recover the latent causal variables $Z_i$ and their causal relations represented by graph $\mathcal{G}_Z$. This problem has recently been known as causal representation learning. This paper is concerned with a general, completely nonparametric setting of causal representation learning from multiple distributions (arising from heterogeneous data or nonstationary time series), without assuming hard interventions behind distribution changes. We aim to develop general solutions in this fundamental case; as a by product, this helps see the unique benefit offered by other assumptions such as parametric causal models or hard interventions. We show that under the sparsity constraint on the recovered graph over the latent variables and suitable sufficient change conditions on the causal influences, interestingly, one can recover the moralized graph of the underlying directed acyclic graph, and the recovered latent variables and their relations are related to the underlying causal model in a specific, nontrivial way. In some cases, most latent variables can even be recovered up to component-wise transformations. Experimental results verify our theoretical claims.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

Watermarking algorithms are potential solutions by embedding detectable signatures within LLM-generated outputs. However, current watermarking schemes lack robustness to a range of attacks such as text substitution or manipulation, undermining their reliability. This paper proposes a novel topic-based watermarking algorithm for LLMs, designed to enhance the robustness of watermarking in LLMs. Our approach leverages the topics extracted from input prompts or outputs of non-watermarked LLMs in the generation process of watermarked text. We dynamically utilize token lists on identified topics and adjust token sampling weights accordingly. By using these topic-specific token biases, we embed a topic-sensitive watermarking into the generated text. We outline the theoretical framework of our topic-based watermarking algorithm and discuss its potential advantages in various scenarios. Additionally, we explore a comprehensive range of attacks against watermarking algorithms, including discrete alterations, paraphrasing, and tokenizations. We demonstrate that our proposed watermarking scheme classifies various watermarked text topics with 99.99% confidence and outperforms existing algorithms in terms of z-score robustness and the feasibility of modeling text degradation by potential attackers, while considering the trade-offs between the benefits and losses of watermarking LLM-generated text.</p></details> | <details><summary>Resul...</summary><p>Results for proposed scheme, additional/removal of content (figures and equations), 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[Constructing Domain-Specific Evaluation Sets for LLM-as-a-judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08808v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the landscape of machine learning, yet current benchmarks often fall short in capturing the diverse behavior of these models in real-world applications. A benchmark's usefulness is determined by its ability to clearly differentiate between models of varying capabilities (separability) and closely align with human preferences. Existing frameworks like Alpaca-Eval 2.0 LC \cite{dubois2024lengthcontrolledalpacaevalsimpleway} and Arena-Hard v0.1 \cite{li2024crowdsourced} are limited by their focus on general-purpose queries and lack of diversity across domains such as law, medicine, and multilingual contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a novel data pipeline that curates diverse, domain-specific evaluation sets tailored for LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks. Our approach leverages a combination of manual curation, semi-supervised learning to generate clusters, and stratified sampling to ensure balanced representation across a wide range of domains and languages. The resulting evaluation set, which includes 1573 samples across 14 categories, demonstrates high separability (84\%) across ten top-ranked models, and agreement (84\%) with Chatbot Arena and (0.915) Spearman correlation. The agreement values are 9\% better than Arena Hard and 20\% better than AlpacaEval 2.0 LC, while the Spearman coefficient is 0.7 more than the next best benchmark, showcasing a significant improvement in the usefulness of the benchmark. We further provide an open-source evaluation tool that enables fine-grained analysis of model performance across user-defined categories, offering valuable insights for practitioners. This work contributes to the ongoing effort to enhance the transparency, diversity, and effectiveness of LLM evaluation methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, Under review</p></details> |

Due to several limiting factors surrounding LLMs (training cost, API access, data availability, etc.), it may not always be feasible to impose direct safety constraints on a deployed model. Therefore, an efficient and reliable alternative is required. To this end, we present our ongoing efforts to create and deploy a library of detectors: compact and easy-to-build classification models that provide labels for various harms. In addition to the detectors themselves, we discuss a wide range of uses for these detector models - from acting as guardrails to enabling effective AI governance. We also deep dive into inherent challenges in their development and discuss future work aimed at making the detectors more reliable and broadening their scope.</p></details> |  |

However, their agents mostly follow predefined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that remain unchanged across the whole interaction, lacking autonomy and scalability. Additionally, current solutions often overlook the necessity for effective agent cooperation. To address the above limitations, we propose MegaAgent, a practical framework designed for autonomous cooperation in large-scale LLM Agent systems. MegaAgent leverages the autonomy of agents to dynamically generate agents based on task requirements, incorporating features such as automatically dividing tasks, systematic planning and monitoring of agent activities, and managing concurrent operations. In addition, MegaAgent is designed with a hierarchical structure and employs system-level parallelism to enhance performance and boost communication. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MegaAgent through Gobang game development, showing that it outperforms popular LLM-MA systems; and national policy simulation, demonstrating its high autonomy and potential to rapidly scale up to 590 agents while ensuring effective cooperation among them. Our results indicate that MegaAgent is the first autonomous large-scale LLM-MA system with no pre-defined SOPs, high effectiveness and scalability, paving the way for further research in this field. Our code is at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MegaAgent-81F3.</p></details> |  |

When building LLM players, fine-grained evaluations are crucial for addressing weaknesses in game-playing abilities. However, existing studies have often overlooked such assessments. Specifically, we point out two issues with the evaluation methods employed. First, game-playing abilities have typically been assessed through game-level outcomes rather than specific event-level skills; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies. To address these issues, we propose an approach utilizing a variant of the SpyFall game, named SpyGame. We conducted an experiment with four LLMs, analyzing their gameplay behavior in SpyGame both quantitatively and qualitatively. For the quantitative analysis, we introduced eight metrics to resolve the first issue, revealing that these metrics are more effective than existing ones for evaluating the two critical skills: intent identification and camouflage. In the qualitative analysis, we performed thematic analysis to resolve the second issue. This analysis identifies four major categories that affect gameplay of LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate how these categories complement and support the findings from the quantitative analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 10 pages</p></details> |

However, the increasing demand for high-quality translations that are not only adequate but also fluent and elegant. To assess the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands, we introduce a suitable benchmark for translating classical Chinese poetry into English. This task requires not only adequacy in translating culturally and historically significant content but also a strict adherence to linguistic fluency and poetic elegance. Our study reveals that existing LLMs fall short of this task. To address these issues, we propose RAT, a \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented machine \textbf{T}ranslation method that enhances the translation process by incorporating knowledge related to classical poetry. Additionally, we propose an automatic evaluation metric based on GPT-4, which better assesses translation quality in terms of adequacy, fluency, and elegance, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Our dataset and code will be made available.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, existing GZSL is still limited to seen domains. In the current work, we pioneer cross-domain GZSL (CDGZSL) which addresses GZSL towards unseen domains. Different from existing GZSL methods which alleviate DSP by generating features of unseen classes with semantics, CDGZSL needs to construct a common feature space across domains and acquire the corresponding intrinsic semantics shared among domains to transfer from seen to unseen domains. Considering the information asymmetry problem caused by redundant class semantics annotated with large language models (LLMs), we present Meta Domain Alignment Semantic Refinement (MDASR). Technically, MDASR consists of two parts: Inter-class Similarity Alignment (ISA), which eliminates the non-intrinsic semantics not shared across all domains under the guidance of inter-class feature relationships, and Unseen-class Meta Generation (UMG), which preserves intrinsic semantics to maintain connectivity between seen and unseen classes by simulating feature generation. MDASR effectively aligns the redundant semantic space with the common feature space, mitigating the information asymmetry in CDGZSL. The effectiveness of MDASR is demonstrated on the Office-Home and Mini-DomainNet, and we have shared the LLM-based semantics for these datasets as the benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

However, it was demonstrated that traditional RAG applications perform poorly in answering multi-hop questions, which require retrieving and reasoning over multiple elements of supporting evidence. We introduce a new method called Multi-Meta-RAG, which uses database filtering with LLM-extracted metadata to improve the RAG selection of the relevant documents from various sources, relevant to the question. While database filtering is specific to a set of questions from a particular domain and format, we found out that Multi-Meta-RAG greatly improves the results on the MultiHop-RAG benchmark.

However, recent approaches to dense text representations (embeddings) do not efficiently exploit these resources. Dense and robust representations of documents are essential for effectively solving downstream classification and retrieval tasks. This work demonstrates that injecting embedded information from knowledge bases can augment the performance of contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based representations for the task of text classification. Further, by considering automated machine learning (AutoML) with the fused representation space, we demonstrate it is possible to improve classification accuracy even if we use low-dimensional projections of the original representation space obtained via efficient matrix factorization. This result shows that significantly faster classifiers can be achieved with minimal or no loss in predictive performance, as demonstrated using five strong LLM baselines on six diverse real-life datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoNoGo: An Efficient LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Streamlining Automotive Software Release Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09785v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for making software deployment decisions in the automotive industry typically rely on manual analysis of tabular software test data. These methods often lead to higher costs and delays in the software release cycle due to their labor-intensive nature. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution to these challenges. However, their application generally demands multiple rounds of human-driven prompt engineering, which limits their practical deployment, particularly for industrial end-users who need reliable and efficient results. In this paper, we propose GoNoGo, an LLM agent system designed to streamline automotive software deployment while meeting both functional requirements and practical industrial constraints. Unlike previous systems, GoNoGo is specifically tailored to address domain-specific and risk-sensitive systems. We evaluate GoNoGo's performance across different task difficulties using zero-shot and few-shot examples taken from industrial practice. Our results show that GoNoGo achieves a 100% success rate for tasks up to Level 2 difficulty with 3-shot examples, and maintains high performance even for more complex tasks. We find that GoNoGo effectively automates decision-making for simpler tasks, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. In summary, GoNoGo represents an efficient and user-friendly LLM-based solution currently employed in our industrial partner's company to assist with software release decision-making, supporting more informed and timely decisions in the release process for risk-sensitive vehicle systems.</p></details> |  |

One critical factor hindering their widespread adoption is the occurrence of hallucinations, where LLMs invent answers that sound realistic, yet drift away from factual truth. In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting hallucinations in large language models, which tackles a critical issue in the adoption of these models in various real-world scenarios. Through extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs, including Llama-2, we study the hallucination levels of various recent LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to automatically detect them. Notably, we observe up to 87% hallucinations for Llama-2 in a specific experiment, where our method achieves a Balanced Accuracy of 81%, all without relying on external knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Demonstration Selection for Improved Fairness in LLM In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09757v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of using in-context learning (ICL) to steer large language models (LLMs) in processing tabular data, a challenging task given the structured nature of such data. Despite advancements in performance, the fairness implications of these methods are less understood. This study investigates how varying demonstrations within ICL prompts influence the fairness outcomes of LLMs. Our findings reveal that deliberately including minority group samples in prompts significantly boosts fairness without sacrificing predictive accuracy. Further experiments demonstrate that the proportion of minority to majority samples in demonstrations affects the trade-off between fairness and prediction accuracy. Based on these insights, we introduce a mitigation technique that employs clustering and evolutionary strategies to curate a diverse and representative sample set from the training data. This approach aims to enhance both predictive performance and fairness in ICL applications. Experimental results validate that our proposed method dramatically improves fairness across various metrics, showing its efficacy in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Paired Completion: Flexible Quantification of Issue-framing at Scale with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09742v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting and quantifying issue framing in textual discourse - the perspective one takes to a given topic (e.g. climate science vs. denialism, misogyny vs. gender equality) - is highly valuable to a range of end-users from social and political scientists to program evaluators and policy analysts. However, conceptual framing is notoriously challenging for automated natural language processing (NLP) methods since the words and phrases used by either `side' of an issue are often held in common, with only subtle stylistic flourishes separating their use. Here we develop and rigorously evaluate new detection methods for issue framing and narrative analysis within large text datasets. By introducing a novel application of next-token log probabilities derived from generative large language models (LLMs) we show that issue framing can be reliably and efficiently detected in large corpora with only a few examples of either perspective on a given issue, a method we call `paired completion'. Through 192 independent experiments over three novel, synthetic datasets, we evaluate paired completion against prompt-based LLM methods and labelled methods using traditional NLP and recent LLM contextual embeddings. We additionally conduct a cost-based analysis to mark out the feasible set of performant methods at production-level scales, and a model bias analysis. Together, our work demonstrates a feasible path to scalable, accurate and low-bias issue-framing in large corpora.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

The effectiveness of these ICEs is influenced by various factors, such as the domain of the source text, the order in which the ICEs are presented, the number of these examples, and the prompt templates used. Naturally, selecting the most impactful ICEs depends on understanding how these affect the resulting translation quality, which ultimately relies on translation references or human judgment. This paper presents a novel methodology for in-context learning (ICL) that relies on a search algorithm guided by domain-specific quality estimation (QE). Leveraging the XGLM model, our methodology estimates the resulting translation quality without the need for translation references, selecting effective ICEs for MT to maximize translation quality. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over existing ICL methods and higher translation performance compared to fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (PLM), specifically mBART-50.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas (AMTA)</p></details> |

This paper investigates the complexities of multilingual prompt-based code generation. Our evaluations of LLMs, including CodeLLaMa and CodeGemma, reveal significant disparities in code quality for non-English prompts; we also demonstrate the inadequacy of simple approaches like prompt translation, bootstrapped data augmentation, and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose a zero-shot cross-lingual approach using a neural projection technique, integrating a cross-lingual encoder like LASER artetxe2019massively to map multilingual embeddings from it into the LLM's token space. This method requires training only on English data and scales effectively to other languages. Results on a translated and quality-checked MBPP dataset show substantial improvements in code quality. This research promotes a more inclusive code generation landscape by empowering LLMs with multilingual capabilities to support the diverse linguistic spectrum in programming.</p></details> | Under Review |

In this work, we pivot to Reinforcement Learning (RL) -- but with a twist. Diverging from the typical RLHF, which refines LLMs following instruction data training, we use RL to directly generate the foundational instruction dataset that alone suffices for fine-tuning. Our method, TeaMs-RL, uses a suite of textual operations and rules, prioritizing the diversification of training datasets. It facilitates the generation of high-quality data without excessive reliance on external advanced models, paving the way for a single fine-tuning step and negating the need for subsequent RLHF stages. Our findings highlight key advantages of our approach: reduced need for human involvement and fewer model queries (only $5.73\%$ of the strong baseline's total), along with enhanced capabilities of LLMs in crafting and comprehending complex instructions compared to strong baselines, and substantially improved model privacy protection.

However, LLM continues to face a significant challenge in that it is highly susceptible to the influence of prompt words. This inconsistency in response to minor alterations in prompt input may compromise the accuracy and resilience of recommendation models. To address this issue, this paper proposes GANPrompt, a multi-dimensional large language model prompt diversity framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The framework enhances the model's adaptability and stability to diverse prompts by integrating GAN generation techniques with the deep semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs. GANPrompt first trains a generator capable of producing diverse prompts by analysing multidimensional user behavioural data. These diverse prompts are then used to train the LLM to improve its performance in the face of unseen prompts. Furthermore, to ensure a high degree of diversity and relevance of the prompts, this study introduces a mathematical theory-based diversity constraint mechanism that optimises the generated prompts to ensure that they are not only superficially distinct, but also semantically cover a wide range of user intentions. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, especially in improving the adaptability and robustness of recommender systems in complex and dynamic environments. The experimental results demonstrate that GANPrompt yields substantial enhancements in accuracy and robustness relative to existing state-of-the-art methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM-based Readability Measurement for Unit Tests' Context-aware Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21369v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated test techniques usually generate unit tests with higher code coverage than manual tests. However, the readability of automated tests is crucial for code comprehension and maintenance. The readability of unit tests involves many aspects. In this paper, we focus on test inputs. The central limitation of existing studies on input readability is that they focus on test codes alone without taking the tested source codes into consideration, making them either ignore different source codes' different readability requirements or require manual efforts to write readable inputs. However, we observe that the source codes specify the contexts that test inputs must satisfy. Based on such observation, we introduce the \underline{C}ontext \underline{C}onsistency \underline{C}riterion (a.k.a, C3), which is a readability measurement tool that leverages Large Language Models to extract primitive-type (including string-type) parameters' readability contexts from the source codes and checks whether test inputs are consistent with those contexts. We have also proposed EvoSuiteC3. It leverages C3's extracted contexts to help EvoSuite generate readable test inputs. We have evaluated C3's performance on $409$ \java{} classes and compared manual and automated tests' readability under C3 measurement. The results are two-fold. First, The Precision, Recall, and F1-Score of C3's mined readability contexts are \precision{}, \recall{}, and \fone{}, respectively. Second, under C3's measurement, the string-type input readability scores of EvoSuiteC3, ChatUniTest (an LLM-based test generation tool), manual tests, and two traditional tools (EvoSuite and Randoop) are $90\%$, $83\%$, $68\%$, $8\%$, and $8\%$, showing the traditional tools' inability in generating readable string-type inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Make the Most of LLMs' Grammatical Knowledge for Acceptability Judgments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09639v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The grammatical knowledge of language models (LMs) is often measured using a benchmark of linguistic minimal pairs, where LMs are presented with a pair of acceptable and unacceptable sentences and required to judge which is acceptable. The existing dominant approach, however, naively calculates and compares the probabilities of paired sentences using LMs. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have yet to be thoroughly examined in this field. We thus investigate how to make the most of LLMs' grammatical knowledge to comprehensively evaluate it. Through extensive experiments of nine judgment methods in English and Chinese, we demonstrate that a probability readout method, in-template LP, and a prompting-based method, Yes/No probability computing, achieve particularly high performance, surpassing the conventional approach. Our analysis reveals their different strengths, e.g., Yes/No probability computing is robust against token-length bias, suggesting that they harness different aspects of LLMs' grammatical knowledge. Consequently, we recommend using diverse judgment methods to evaluate LLMs comprehensively.</p></details> |  |

However, the literature has yet to conclusively demonstrate that LLMs consistently outperform 1stTRs across all NLP tasks. This study compares three 1stTRs (BERT, RoBERTa, and BART) with two open LLMs (Llama 2 and Bloom) across 11 sentiment analysis datasets. The results indicate that open LLMs may moderately outperform or match 1stTRs in 8 out of 11 datasets but only when fine-tuned. Given this substantial cost for only moderate gains, the practical applicability of these models in cost-sensitive scenarios is questionable. In this context, a confidence-based strategy that seamlessly integrates 1stTRs with open LLMs based on prediction certainty is proposed. High-confidence documents are classified by the more cost-effective 1stTRs, while uncertain cases are handled by LLMs in zero-shot or few-shot modes, at a much lower cost than fine-tuned versions. Experiments in sentiment analysis demonstrate that our solution not only outperforms 1stTRs, zero-shot, and few-shot LLMs but also competes closely with fine-tuned LLMs at a fraction of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Merging LLMs and adapters has shown promising results for various natural language domains and tasks, enabling the use of the learned models and adapters without additional training for a new task. [Objective] This research proposes continual merging and empirically studies the capabilities of merged adapters in Code LLMs, specially for the Automated Program Repair (APR) task. The goal is to gain insights into whether and how merging task-specific adapters can affect the performance of APR. [Method] In our framework, MergeRepair, we plan to merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter for the APR task. Particularly, we will employ two main merging scenarios for all three techniques, (i) merging using equal-weight averaging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance; and (ii) our proposed approach, continual merging, in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters and the order and weight of merged adapters matter. By exploratory study of merging techniques, we will investigate the improvement and generalizability of merged adapters for APR.

To address this issue, we propose the automated generation of variants using large language models. We design, develop and evaluate Gal\'apagos: a tool for generating program variants using LLMs, validating their correctness and equivalence, and using them to assemble N-Version binaries. We evaluate Gal\'apagos by creating N-Version components of real-world C code. Our original results show that Gal\'apagos can produce program variants that are proven to be functionally equivalent, even when the variants are written in a different programming language. Our systematic diversity measurement indicate that functionally equivalent variants produced by Gal\'apagos, are statically different after compilation, and present diverging internal behavior at runtime. We demonstrate that the variants produced by Gal\'apagos can protect C code against real miscompilation bugs which affect the Clang compiler. Overall, our paper shows that producing N-Version software can be drastically automated by advanced usage of practical formal verification and generative language models.</p></details> |  |

However, more research is needed to assess how different prompts, seed data selection strategies, filtering methods, or model settings affect the quality of paraphrased data (and downstream models). In this study, we investigate three text diversity incentive methods well established in crowdsourcing: taboo words, hints by previous outlier solutions, and chaining on previous outlier solutions. Using these incentive methods as part of instructions to LLMs augmenting text datasets, we measure their effects on generated texts lexical diversity and downstream model performance. We compare the effects over 5 different LLMs, 6 datasets and 2 downstream models. We show that diversity is most increased by taboo words, but downstream model performance is highest with hints.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL'2...</summary><p>ACL'24 version, 24 pages</p></details> |

We engage in experiments across eight diverse datasets, focusing on four representative tasks encompassing entity and relation extraction, event extraction, link prediction, and question-answering, thereby thoroughly exploring LLMs' performance in the domain of construction and inference. Empirically, our findings suggest that LLMs, represented by GPT-4, are more suited as inference assistants rather than few-shot information extractors. Specifically, while GPT-4 exhibits good performance in tasks related to KG construction, it excels further in reasoning tasks, surpassing fine-tuned models in certain cases. Moreover, our investigation extends to the potential generalization ability of LLMs for information extraction, leading to the proposition of a Virtual Knowledge Extraction task and the development of the corresponding VINE dataset. Based on these empirical findings, we further propose AutoKG, a multi-agent-based approach employing LLMs and external sources for KG construction and reasoning. We anticipate that this research can provide invaluable insights for future undertakings in the field of knowledge graphs.

This blurring of lines between machine- and human-written text presents new challenges in distinguishing one from the other a task further complicated by the frequent updates and closed nature of leading proprietary LLMs. Traditional logits-based detection methods leverage surrogate models for identifying LLM-generated content when the exact logits are unavailable from black-box LLMs. However, these methods grapple with the misalignment between the distributions of the surrogate and the often undisclosed target models, leading to performance degradation, particularly with the introduction of new, closed-source models. Furthermore, while current methodologies are generally effective when the source model is identified, they falter in scenarios where the model version remains unknown, or the test set comprises outputs from various source models. To address these limitations, we present Distribution-Aligned LLMs Detection (DALD), an innovative framework that redefines the state-of-the-art performance in black-box text detection even without logits from source LLMs. DALD is designed to align the surrogate model's distribution with that of unknown target LLMs, ensuring enhanced detection capability and resilience against rapid model iterations with minimal training investment. By leveraging corpus samples from publicly accessible outputs of advanced models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Claude-3, DALD fine-tunes surrogate models to synchronize with unknown source model distributions effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative AI Voting: Fair Collective Choice is Resilient to LLM Biases and Inconsistencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11871v2)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling up deliberative and voting participation is a longstanding endeavor -- a cornerstone for direct democracy and legitimate collective choice. Recent breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) unravel new capabilities for AI personal assistants to overcome cognitive bandwidth limitations of humans, providing decision support or even direct representation of human voters at large scale. However, the quality of this representation and what underlying biases manifest when delegating collective decision-making to LLMs is an alarming and timely challenge to tackle. By rigorously emulating with high realism more than >50K LLM voting personas in 81 real-world voting elections, we disentangle the nature of different biases in LLMS (GPT 3, GPT 3.5, and Llama2). Complex preferential ballot formats exhibit significant inconsistencies compared to simpler majoritarian elections that show higher consistency. Strikingly though, by demonstrating for the first time in real-world a proportional representation of voters in direct democracy, we are also able to show that fair ballot aggregation methods, such as equal shares, prove to be a win-win: fairer voting outcomes for humans with fairer AI representation. This novel underlying relationship proves paramount for democratic resilience in progressives scenarios with low voters turnout and voter fatigue supported by AI representatives: abstained voters are mitigated by recovering highly representative voting outcomes that are fairer. These interdisciplinary insights provide remarkable foundations for science, policymakers, and citizens to develop safeguards and resilience for AI risks in democratic innovations.</p></details> | 33 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Towards Boosting LLMs-driven Relevance Modeling with Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09439v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries. Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance. However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation. Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective. To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions. The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs. In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively. Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations. Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects. For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling. Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.</p></details> |  |

Extracting and semantically representing tabular data is challenging due to diverse table presentations. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial potential for semantic representation, yet they encounter challenges related to accuracy and context size limitations, which are crucial considerations for the industry applications. We introduce HySem, a pipeline that employs a novel context length optimization technique to generate accurate semantic JSON representations from HTML tables. This approach utilizes a custom fine-tuned model specifically designed for cost- and privacy-sensitive small and medium pharmaceutical enterprises. Running on commodity hardware and leveraging open-source models, our auto-correcting agents rectify both syntax and semantic errors in LLM-generated content. HySem surpasses its peer open-source models in accuracy and provides competitive performance when benchmarked against OpenAI GPT-4o and effectively addresses context length limitations, which is a crucial factor for supporting larger tables.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 tables, 3 figures, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

In this scenario, tokenizing (i.e., indexing) users and items becomes essential for ensuring a seamless alignment of LLMs with recommendations. While several studies have made progress in representing users and items through textual contents or latent representations, challenges remain in efficiently capturing high-order collaborative knowledge into discrete tokens that are compatible with LLMs. Additionally, the majority of existing tokenization approaches often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to new/unseen users or items that were not in the training corpus. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called TokenRec, which introduces not only an effective ID tokenization strategy but also an efficient retrieval paradigm for LLM-based recommendations. Specifically, our tokenization strategy, Masked Vector-Quantized (MQ) Tokenizer, involves quantizing the masked user/item representations learned from collaborative filtering into discrete tokens, thus achieving a smooth incorporation of high-order collaborative knowledge and a generalizable tokenization of users and items for LLM-based RecSys. Meanwhile, our generative retrieval paradigm is designed to efficiently recommend top-$K$ items for users to eliminate the need for the time-consuming auto-regressive decoding and beam search processes used by LLMs, thus significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating that TokenRec outperforms competitive benchmarks, including both traditional recommender systems and emerging LLM-based recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TKDE.

This paper introduces the Interaction-driven Game Engine (IGE) powered by LLM, which allows everyone to develop a custom game using natural language through Human-LLM interaction. To enable an LLM to function as an IGE, we instruct it to perform the following processes in each turn: (1) $P_{script}$ : configure the game script segment based on the user's input; (2) $P_{code}$ : generate the corresponding code snippet based on the game script segment; (3) $P_{utter}$ : interact with the user, including guidance and feedback. We propose a data synthesis pipeline based on the LLM to generate game script-code pairs and interactions from a few manually crafted seed data. We propose a three-stage progressive training strategy to transfer the dialogue-based LLM to our IGE smoothly. We construct an IGE for poker games as a case study and comprehensively evaluate it from two perspectives: interaction quality and code correctness. The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/alterego238/IGE}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing and Evaluating the Reliability of LLMs against Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09326v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly become pivotal in content generation with notable societal impact. These models hold the potential to generate content that could be deemed harmful.Efforts to mitigate this risk include implementing safeguards to ensure LLMs adhere to social ethics.However, despite such measures, the phenomenon of "jailbreaking" -- where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models -- persists as a significant challenge. Recognizing the continuous threat posed by jailbreaking tactics and their repercussions for the trustworthy use of LLMs, a rigorous assessment of the models' robustness against such attacks is essential. This study introduces an comprehensive evaluation framework and conducts an large-scale empirical experiment to address this need. We concentrate on 10 cutting-edge jailbreak strategies across three categories, 1525 questions from 61 specific harmful categories, and 13 popular LLMs. We adopt multi-dimensional metrics such as Attack Success Rate (ASR), Toxicity Score, Fluency, Token Length, and Grammatical Errors to thoroughly assess the LLMs' outputs under jailbreak. By normalizing and aggregating these metrics, we present a detailed reliability score for different LLMs, coupled with strategic recommendations to reduce their susceptibility to such vulnerabilities. Additionally, we explore the relationships among the models, attack strategies, and types of harmful content, as well as the correlations between the evaluation metrics, which proves the validity of our multifaceted evaluation framework. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate a lack of resilience among all tested LLMs against certain strategies, and highlight the need to concentrate on the reliability facets of LLMs. We believe our study can provide valuable insights into enhancing the security evaluation of LLMs against jailbreak within the domain.</p></details> |  |

However, their application to complex, domain-specific tasks, such as cyber-security, often faces substantial challenges. In this study, we introduce SecKnowledge and CyberPal.AI to address these challenges and train security-expert LLMs. SecKnowledge is a domain-knowledge-driven cyber-security instruction dataset, meticulously designed using years of accumulated expert knowledge in the domain through a multi-phase generation process. CyberPal.AI refers to a family of LLMs fine-tuned using SecKnowledge, aimed at building security-specialized LLMs capable of answering and following complex security-related instructions. Additionally, we introduce SecKnowledge-Eval, a comprehensive and diverse cyber-security evaluation benchmark, composed of an extensive set of cyber-security tasks we specifically developed to assess LLMs in the field of cyber-security, along with other publicly available security benchmarks. Our results show a significant average improvement of up to 24% over the baseline models, underscoring the benefits of our expert-driven instruction dataset generation process. These findings contribute to the advancement of AI-based cyber-security applications, paving the way for security-expert LLMs that can enhance threat-hunting and investigation processes.</p></details> |  |

Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, while useful, often fail to capture the semantic richness and contextual relevance of free-form text compared to reference answers. In this study, we introduce a reference-guided verdict method that leverages multiple LLMs-as-judges to provide a more reliable and accurate evaluation of open-ended LLM generations. By integrating diverse LLMs, our approach mitigates individual model biases and significantly improves alignment with human judgments, especially in challenging tasks where traditional metrics and single-model evaluations fall short. Through experiments across multiple question-answering tasks, we show that our method closely aligns with human evaluations, establishing it as a scalable, reproducible, and effective alternative to human evaluation. Our approach not only enhances evaluation reliability but also opens new avenues for refining automated assessment in generative AI.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis reveals significant norm inconsistencies: (1) a discordance between the recommendation to call the police and the actual presence of criminal activity, and (2) biases influenced by the racial demographics of the neighborhoods.

However, existing approaches to RAG fall short by neglecting system state variables, which are crucial for ensuring adaptive control, retrieval halting, and system convergence. In this paper, we introduce the TC-RAG through rigorous proof, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by incorporating a Turing Complete System to manage state variables, thereby enabling more efficient and accurate knowledge retrieval. By leveraging a memory stack system with adaptive retrieval, reasoning, and planning capabilities, TC-RAG not only ensures the controlled halting of retrieval processes but also mitigates the accumulation of erroneous knowledge via Push and Pop actions. In the case study of the medical domain, our extensive experiments on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate the superiority of TC-RAG over existing methods in accuracy by over 7.20\%.

Because Cognitive Architectures are famously developed for the purpose of modeling the internal mechanisms of human cognitive decision-making at a computational level, new investigations consider the goal of informing LLMs with the knowledge necessary for replicating such processes, e.g., guided perception, memory, goal-setting, and action. Previous approaches that use LLMs for grounded decision-making struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require slower, deliberate cognition over fast and intuitive inference -- reporting issues related to the lack of sufficient grounding, as in hallucination. To resolve these challenges, we introduce LLM-ACTR, a novel neuro-symbolic architecture that provides human-aligned and versatile decision-making by integrating the ACT-R Cognitive Architecture with LLMs. Our framework extracts and embeds knowledge of ACT-R's internal decision-making process as latent neural representations, injects this information into trainable LLM adapter layers, and fine-tunes the LLMs for downstream prediction. Our experiments on novel Design for Manufacturing tasks show both improved task performance as well as improved grounded decision-making capability of our approach, compared to LLM-only baselines that leverage chain-of-thought reasoning strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, it is challenging for users to discern whether the responses are generated with certainty or are fabricated to meet user expectations. Estimating the uncertainty of LLMs is particularly challenging due to their vast scale and the lack of white-box access. In this work, we propose a novel Uncertainty Tripartite Testing Paradigm (Unc-TTP) to classify LLM uncertainty, via evaluating the consistency of LLM outputs when incorporating label interference into the sampling-based approach. Based on Unc-TTP outputs, we aggregate instances into certain and uncertain categories. Further, we conduct a detailed analysis of the uncertainty properties of LLMs and show Unc-TTP's superiority over the existing sampling-based methods. In addition, we leverage the obtained uncertainty information to guide in-context example selection, demonstrating that Unc-TTP obviously outperforms retrieval-based and sampling-based approaches in selecting more informative examples. Our work paves a new way to classify the uncertainty of both open- and closed-source LLMs, and introduces a practical approach to exploit this uncertainty to improve LLMs performance.</p></details> | 7 pages, long paper |

This work proposes using data watermarks to enable principled detection with only black-box model access, provided that the rightholder contributed multiple training documents and watermarked them before public release. By applying a randomly sampled data watermark, detection can be framed as hypothesis testing, which provides guarantees on the false detection rate. We study two watermarks: one that inserts random sequences, and another that randomly substitutes characters with Unicode lookalikes. We first show how three aspects of watermark design -- watermark length, number of duplications, and interference -- affect the power of the hypothesis test. Next, we study how a watermark's detection strength changes under model and dataset scaling: while increasing the dataset size decreases the strength of the watermark, watermarks remain strong if the model size also increases. Finally, we view SHA hashes as natural watermarks and show that we can robustly detect hashes from BLOOM-176B's training data, as long as they occurred at least 90 times. Together, our results point towards a promising future for data watermarks in real world use.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2024 |

Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have potential in auditing smart contracts, but the state-of-the-art indicates that even GPT-4 can achieve only 30% precision (when both decision and justification are correct). This is likely because off-the-shelf LLMs were primarily pre-trained on a general text/code corpus and not fine-tuned on the specific domain of Solidity smart contract auditing. In this paper, we propose iAudit, a general framework that combines fine-tuning and LLM-based agents for intuitive smart contract auditing with justifications. Specifically, iAudit is inspired by the observation that expert human auditors first perceive what could be wrong and then perform a detailed analysis of the code to identify the cause. As such, iAudit employs a two-stage fine-tuning approach: it first tunes a Detector model to make decisions and then tunes a Reasoner model to generate causes of vulnerabilities. However, fine-tuning alone faces challenges in accurately identifying the optimal cause of a vulnerability. Therefore, we introduce two LLM-based agents, the Ranker and Critic, to iteratively select and debate the most suitable cause of vulnerability based on the output of the fine-tuned Reasoner model. To evaluate iAudit, we collected a balanced dataset with 1,734 positive and 1,810 negative samples to fine-tune iAudit. We then compared it with traditional fine-tuned models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, and UnixCoder) as well as prompt learning-based LLMs (GPT4, GPT-3.5, and CodeLlama-13b/34b). On a dataset of 263 real smart contract vulnerabilities, iAudit achieves an F1 score of 91.21% and an accuracy of 91.11%. The causes generated by iAudit achieved a consistency of about 38% compared to the ground truth causes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |

Smart contract code summarization can significantly facilitate the maintenance of smart contracts and mitigate their vulnerabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, possess the capability to generate code summarizations from code examples embedded in prompts. However, the performance of LLMs in code summarization remains suboptimal compared to fine-tuning-based models (e.g., CodeT5+, CodeBERT). Therefore, we propose SCLA, a framework leveraging LLMs and semantic augmentation to improve code summarization performance. SCLA constructs the smart contract's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to extract latent semantics, thereby forming a semantically augmented prompt. For evaluation, we utilize a large-scale dataset comprising 40,000 real-world contracts. Experimental results demonstrate that SCLA, with its enhanced prompt, significantly improves the quality of code summarizations. SCLA surpasses other state-of-the-art models (e.g., CodeBERT, CodeT5, and CodeT5+), achieving 37.53% BLEU-4, 52.54% METEOR, 56.97% ROUGE-L, and 63.44% BLEURT, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs often generate code that is syntactically correct and even semantically plausible, but may not execute as expected or fulfill specified requirements. This phenomenon of hallucinations in the code domain has not been systematically explored. To advance the community's understanding and research on this issue, we introduce the concept of code hallucinations and propose a classification method for code hallucination based on execution verification. We categorize code hallucinations into four main types: mapping, naming, resource, and logic hallucinations, with each category further divided into different subcategories to understand and address the unique challenges faced by LLMs in code generation with finer granularity. Additionally, we present a dynamic detection algorithm called CodeHalu designed to detect and quantify code hallucinations. We also introduce the CodeHaluEval benchmark, which includes 8,883 samples from 699 tasks, to systematically and quantitatively evaluate code hallucinations. By evaluating 17 popular LLMs using this benchmark, we reveal significant differences in their accuracy and reliability in code generation, offering detailed insights for further improving the code generation capabilities of LLMs. The CodeHalu benchmark and code are publicly available at https://github.com/yuchen814/CodeHalu.</p></details> |  |

Keyboard-based chart navigation has emerged as a potential solution, yet efficient data exploration remains challenging. We present VizAbility, a novel system that enriches chart content navigation with conversational interaction, enabling users to use natural language for querying visual data trends. VizAbility adapts to the user's navigation context for improved response accuracy and facilitates verbal command-based chart navigation. Furthermore, it can address queries for contextual information, designed to address the needs of visually impaired users. We designed a large language model (LLM)-based pipeline to address these user queries, leveraging chart data & encoding, user context, and external web knowledge. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative studies to evaluate VizAbility's multimodal approach. We discuss further opportunities based on the results, including improved benchmark testing, incorporation of vision models, and integration with visualization workflows.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Can Editing LLMs Inject Harm?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20224v3)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing has been increasingly adopted to correct the false or outdated knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs). Meanwhile, one critical but under-explored question is: can knowledge editing be used to inject harm into LLMs? In this paper, we propose to reformulate knowledge editing as a new type of safety threat for LLMs, namely Editing Attack, and conduct a systematic investigation with a newly constructed dataset EditAttack. Specifically, we focus on two typical safety risks of Editing Attack including Misinformation Injection and Bias Injection. For the risk of misinformation injection, we first categorize it into commonsense misinformation injection and long-tail misinformation injection. Then, we find that editing attacks can inject both types of misinformation into LLMs, and the effectiveness is particularly high for commonsense misinformation injection. For the risk of bias injection, we discover that not only can biased sentences be injected into LLMs with high effectiveness, but also one single biased sentence injection can cause a bias increase in general outputs of LLMs, which are even highly irrelevant to the injected sentence, indicating a catastrophic impact on the overall fairness of LLMs. Then, we further illustrate the high stealthiness of editing attacks, measured by their impact on the general knowledge and reasoning capacities of LLMs, and show the hardness of defending editing attacks with empirical evidence. Our discoveries demonstrate the emerging misuse risks of knowledge editing techniques on compromising the safety alignment of LLMs and the feasibility of disseminating misinformation or bias with LLMs as new channels.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally. 9 pages for main paper, 36 pages including appendix.

In this paper, we investigate the question of whether an LLM can discover its own limitations from the errors it makes. To this end, we propose a Self-Challenge evaluation framework with human-in-the-loop. Starting from seed instances that GPT-4 fails to answer, we prompt GPT-4 to summarize error patterns that can be used to generate new instances and incorporate human feedback on them to refine these patterns for generating more challenging data, iteratively. We end up with 8 diverse patterns, such as text manipulation and questions with assumptions. We then build a benchmark, SC-G4, consisting of 1,835 instances generated by GPT-4 using these patterns, with human-annotated gold responses. The SC-G4 serves as a challenging benchmark that allows for a detailed assessment of LLMs' abilities. Our results show that only 44.96\% of instances in SC-G4 can be answered correctly by GPT-4. Interestingly, our pilot study indicates that these error patterns also challenge other LLMs, such as Claude-3 and Llama-3, and cannot be fully resolved through fine-tuning. Our work takes the first step to demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously identify their inherent flaws and provide insights for future dynamic and automatic evaluation.</p></details> | COLM 2024 |

This work accompanies the first-ever release of a LLM-generated, MBR-decoded and QE-reranked dataset with both sentence-level and multi-sentence examples. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the quality of our dataset in terms of its downstream impact on NMT model performance. We find that training from scratch on our (machine-generated) dataset outperforms training on the (web-crawled) WMT'23 training dataset (which is 300 times larger), and also outperforms training on the top-quality subset of the WMT'23 training dataset. We also find that performing self-distillation by finetuning the LLM which generated this dataset outperforms the LLM's strong few-shot baseline. These findings corroborate the quality of our dataset, and demonstrate the value of high-quality machine-generated data in improving performance of NMT models.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the imperative need for proper authorship attribution is essential to uphold the credibility and accountability of authentic authorship. The rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have blurred the lines between human and machine authorship, posing significant challenges for traditional methods. We presents a comprehensive literature review that examines the latest research on authorship attribution in the era of LLMs. This survey systematically explores the landscape of this field by categorizing four representative problems: (1) Human-written Text Attribution; (2) LLM-generated Text Detection; (3) LLM-generated Text Attribution; and (4) Human-LLM Co-authored Text Attribution. We also discuss the challenges related to ensuring the generalization and explainability of authorship attribution methods. Generalization requires the ability to generalize across various domains, while explainability emphasizes providing transparent and understandable insights into the decisions made by these models. By evaluating the strengths and limitations of existing methods and benchmarks, we identify key open problems and future research directions in this field. This literature review serves a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the state of the art in this rapidly evolving field.

To mitigate the risk of errors and missing edge cases, the concept of defeaters - arguments or evidence that challenge claims in an assurance case - has been introduced. Defeaters can provide timely detection of weaknesses in the arguments, prompting further investigation and timely mitigations. However, capturing defeaters relies on expert judgment, experience, and creativity and must be done iteratively due to evolving requirements and regulations. This paper proposes CoDefeater, an automated process to leverage large language models (LLMs) for finding defeaters. Initial results on two systems show that LLMs can efficiently find known and unforeseen feasible defeaters to support safety analysts in enhancing the completeness and confidence of assurance cases.</p></details> | ASE 2024 NIER |

To extend the reach of medical AI advancements to a broader population, we aim to develop medical LLMs across the six most widely spoken languages, encompassing a global population of 6.1 billion. This effort culminates in the creation of the ApolloCorpora multilingual medical dataset and the XMedBench benchmark. In the multilingual medical benchmark, the released Apollo models, at various relatively-small sizes (i.e., 0.5B, 1.8B, 2B, 6B, and 7B), achieve the best performance among models of equivalent size. Especially, Apollo-7B is the state-of-the-art multilingual medical LLMs up to 70B. Additionally, these lite models could be used to improve the multi-lingual medical capabilities of larger models without fine-tuning in a proxy-tuning fashion. We will open-source training corpora, code, model weights and evaluation benchmark.</p></details> | Preprint |

This promises to eliminate the need for manually labeled training data and task-specific model training. However, it remains an open question whether tools like ChatGPT can deliver on this promise. In this paper, we show that smaller, fine-tuned LLMs (still) consistently and significantly outperform larger, zero-shot prompted models in text classification. We compare three major generative AI models (ChatGPT with GPT-3.5/GPT-4 and Claude Opus) with several fine-tuned LLMs across a diverse set of classification tasks (sentiment, approval/disapproval, emotions, party positions) and text categories (news, tweets, speeches). We find that fine-tuning with application-specific training data achieves superior performance in all cases. To make this approach more accessible to a broader audience, we provide an easy-to-use toolkit alongside this paper. Our toolkit, accompanied by non-technical step-by-step guidance, enables users to select and fine-tune BERT-like LLMs for any classification task with minimal technical and computational effort.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Evaluator: Measuring LLMs' Adherence to Task Evaluation Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08781v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs-as-a-judge is a recently popularized method which replaces human judgements in task evaluation (Zheng et al. 2024) with automatic evaluation using LLMs. Due to widespread use of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT4 and Llama3 are expected to have strong alignment with human preferences when prompted for a quality judgement, such as the coherence of a text. While this seems beneficial, it is not clear whether the assessments by an LLM-as-a-judge constitute only an evaluation based on the instructions in the prompts, or reflect its preference for high-quality data similar to its fine-tune data. To investigate how much influence prompting the LLMs-as-a-judge has on the alignment of AI judgements to human judgements, we analyze prompts with increasing levels of instructions about the target quality of an evaluation, for several LLMs-as-a-judge. Further, we compare to a prompt-free method using model perplexity as a quality measure instead. We aggregate a taxonomy of quality criteria commonly used across state-of-the-art evaluations with LLMs and provide this as a rigorous benchmark of models as judges. Overall, we show that the LLMs-as-a-judge benefit only little from highly detailed instructions in prompts and that perplexity can sometimes align better with human judgements than prompting, especially on textual quality.</p></details> |  |

However, current bias mitigation methods often require intensive human feedback, lack transferability to other topics or yield overconfident and random outputs. We find that involving LLMs in role-playing scenario boosts their ability to recognize and mitigate biases. Based on this, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Multi-role Debates as Feedback (RLDF), a novel approach for bias mitigation replacing human feedback in traditional RLHF. We utilize LLMs in multi-role debates to create a dataset that includes both high-bias and low-bias instances for training the reward model in reinforcement learning. Our approach comprises two modes: (1) self-reflection, where the same LLM participates in multi-role debates, and (2) teacher-student, where a more advanced LLM like GPT-3.5-turbo guides the LLM to perform this task. Experimental results across different LLMs on BBQ and our datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in bias mitigation.

PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) response evaluation, and (2) response generation. In the response evaluation module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. In each step, we use inter-rater agreement using Cohen's Kappa between human annotators and LLMs. For the response generation module, we compare different configurations for the LLM Feedback Loop using the identified LLM evaluator configuration. We use the win rate (the fraction of times a generation framework is selected as the best by an LLM evaluator) to determine the best multi-agent configuration for generation. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we use models from the GPT, Gemma, and Llama families to generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline. We generate two types of PO datasets, one to improve the generation capabilities of individual LLM and the other to improve the multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across datasets when the candidate responses do not include responses from the GPT family. Additionally, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-agent Llama and Gemma, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the use of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for autonomous spacecraft control, using the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games suite (KSPDG) as a testing environment. Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches face limitations in this domain due to insufficient simulation capabilities and data. By leveraging LLMs, specifically fine-tuning models like GPT-3.5 and LLaMA, we demonstrate how these models can effectively control spacecraft using language-based inputs and outputs. Our approach integrates real-time mission telemetry into textual prompts processed by the LLM, which then generate control actions via an agent. The results open a discussion about the potential of LLMs for space operations beyond their nominal use for text-related tasks. Future work aims to expand this methodology to other space control tasks and evaluate the performance of different LLM families.

Systematically Evaluating and Mitigating Output Format Bias of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08656v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic evaluation examining format bias in performance of large language models (LLMs). Our approach distinguishes between two categories of an evaluation metric under format constraints to reliably and accurately assess performance: one measures performance when format constraints are adhered to, while the other evaluates performance regardless of constraint adherence. We then define a metric for measuring the format bias of LLMs and establish effective strategies to reduce it. Subsequently, we present our empirical format bias evaluation spanning four commonly used categories -- multiple-choice question-answer, wrapping, list, and mapping -- covering 15 widely-used formats. Our evaluation on eight generation tasks uncovers significant format bias across state-of-the-art LLMs. We further discover that improving the format-instruction following capabilities of LLMs across formats potentially reduces format bias. Based on our evaluation findings, we study prompting and fine-tuning with synthesized format data techniques to mitigate format bias. Our methods successfully reduce the variance in ChatGPT's performance among wrapping formats from 235.33 to 0.71 (%$^2$).</p></details> |  |
| **[Emphasising Structured Information: Integrating Abstract Meaning Representation into LLMs for Enhanced Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01129v3)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention. Trainable evaluation metrics, typically trained with true positive and randomly selected negative responses, tend to assign higher scores to responses that share greater content similarity with a given context. However, adversarial negative responses, despite possessing high content similarity with the contexts, are semantically different. Consequently, existing evaluation metrics are not robust enough to evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations with human judgments. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still face challenges in effectively handling adversarial negative examples. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for open-domain dialogue evaluation, which combines domain-specific language models (SLMs) enhanced with Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) knowledge with LLMs. The SLMs can explicitly incorporate AMR graph information of the dialogue through a gating mechanism for enhanced dialogue semantic representation learning. Both the evaluation result from the SLMs and the AMR graph information are incorporated into the LLM's prompt for enhanced evaluation performance. Experimental results on open-domain dialogue evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, especially in discriminating adversarial negative responses.

This capability allows LLMs to function as agents that can emulate human beings at a more sophisticated level, beyond the mere replication of basic human behaviours. However, there is a lack of exploring into leveraging LLMs to craft characters from diverse aspects. In this work, we introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which leverages LLMs to simulate real-world characters that can be freely customised according to various user preferences. This adaptable framework is beneficial for the design of customisable characters and role-playing agents aligned with human preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset, which encompasses 68 different customised characters, 1,360 multi-turn role-playing dialogues, and a total of 13,971 interaction dialogues. The characters are created from several real-world elements, such as career, aspiration, trait, and skill. Building upon these foundations, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent. It incorporates diverse real-world scenes and topic-specific character interaction dialogues, thereby simulating characters' life experiences in various scenarios and topic-specific interactions with specific emotions. Experimental results indicate that our proposed framework achieves desirable performance and provides a valuable guideline for the construction of more accurate human simulacra in the future.

The crux of applying autoregressive training in language generation to visual generation is discretization -- representing continuous data like images and videos as discrete tokens. Common methods of discretizing images and videos include modeling raw pixel values, which are prohibitively lengthy, or vector quantization, which requires convoluted pre-hoc training. In this work, we propose to directly model images and videos as compressed files saved on computers via canonical codecs (e.g., JPEG, AVC/H.264). Using the default Llama architecture without any vision-specific modifications, we pretrain JPEG-LM from scratch to generate images (and AVC-LM to generate videos as a proof of concept), by directly outputting compressed file bytes in JPEG and AVC formats. Evaluation of image generation shows that this simple and straightforward approach is more effective than pixel-based modeling and sophisticated vector quantization baselines (on which our method yields a 31% reduction in FID). Our analysis shows that JPEG-LM has an especial advantage over vector quantization models in generating long-tail visual elements. Overall, we show that using canonical codec representations can help lower the barriers between language generation and visual generation, facilitating future research on multi-modal language/image/video LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have employed Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning, using natural language to generate robot policies in both simulation and real-world environments. LLMs like GPT-4 have shown promising results in generalizing to unseen tasks, but their applicability is limited due to hallucinations caused by insufficient grounding in the robot environment. The robustness of LLMs in task planning can be enhanced with environmental state information and feedback. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to task planning that utilizes two separate LLMs for high-level planning and low-level control, improving task-related success rates and goal condition recall. Our algorithm, \textit{BrainBody-LLM}, draws inspiration from the human neural system, emulating its brain-body architecture by dividing planning across two LLMs in a structured, hierarchical manner. BrainBody-LLM implements a closed-loop feedback mechanism, enabling learning from simulator errors to resolve execution errors in complex settings. We demonstrate the successful application of BrainBody-LLM in the VirtualHome simulation environment, achieving a 29\% improvement in task-oriented success rates over competitive baselines with the GPT-4 backend. Additionally, we evaluate our algorithm on seven complex tasks using a realistic physics simulator and the Franka Research 3 robotic arm, comparing it with various state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results show advancements in the reasoning capabilities of recent LLMs, which enable them to learn from raw simulator/controller errors to correct plans, making them highly effective in robotic task planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to Autonomous Robots</p></details> |

Traditionally, students relied heavily on web search for coding assistance, but this has shifted with the adoption of LLMs like ChatGPT. However, the comparative process and outcomes of using web search versus LLMs for coding help remain underexplored. To address this, we conducted a randomized interview study in a database classroom to compare web search and LLMs, including a publicly available LLM (ChatGPT) and an instructor-tuned LLM, for writing SQL queries. Our findings indicate that using an instructor-tuned LLM required significantly more interactions than both ChatGPT and web search, but resulted in a similar number of edits to the final SQL query. No significant differences were found in the quality of the final SQL queries between conditions, although the LLM conditions directionally showed higher query quality. Furthermore, students using instructor-tuned LLM reported a lower mental demand. These results have implications for learning and productivity in programming education.</p></details> |  |

This design enables AI to learn from and operate within complex, real-world environments. Large Language Models (LLMs) deeply explore language instructions, playing a crucial role in devising plans for complex tasks. Consequently, they have progressively shown immense potential in empowering embodied AI, with LLM-based embodied AI emerging as a focal point of research within the community. It is foreseeable that, over the next decade, LLM-based embodied AI robots are expected to proliferate widely, becoming commonplace in homes and industries. However, a critical safety issue that has long been hiding in plain sight is: could LLM-based embodied AI perpetrate harmful behaviors? Our research investigates for the first time how to induce threatening actions in embodied AI, confirming the severe risks posed by these soon-to-be-marketed robots, which starkly contravene Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics and threaten human safety. Specifically, we formulate the concept of embodied AI jailbreaking and expose three critical security vulnerabilities: first, jailbreaking robotics through compromised LLM; second, safety misalignment between action and language spaces; and third, deceptive prompts leading to unaware hazardous behaviors.

While the draft head in speculative decoding mitigates this issue, its full potential remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce KOALA (K-layer Optimized Adversarial Learning Architecture), an orthogonal approach to the draft head. By transforming the conventional single-layer draft head into a multi-layer architecture and incorporating adversarial learning into the traditional supervised training, KOALA significantly improves the accuracy of the draft head in predicting subsequent tokens, thus more closely mirroring the functionality of LLMs. Although this improvement comes at the cost of slightly increased drafting overhead, KOALA substantially unlocks the draft head's potential, greatly enhancing speculative decoding. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of KOALA, including both autoregressive and non-autoregressive draft heads across various tasks, demonstrating a latency speedup ratio improvement of 0.24x-0.41x, which is 10.57%-14.09% faster than the original draft heads.</p></details> |  |

Some approaches train LLMs using their own generated synthetic data, exploring the possibility of active alignment. However, there is still a huge gap between these one-time alignment methods and the continuous automatic alignment of humans. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{I-SHEEP}, an \textbf{I}terative \textbf{S}elf-En\textbf{H}anc\textbf{E}m\textbf{E}nt \textbf{P}aradigm.This human-like paradigm enables LLMs to \textbf{continuously self-align from scratch with nothing}. Compared to the one-time alignment method Dromedary \cite{sun2023principledriven}, which refers to the first iteration in this paper, I-SHEEP can significantly enhance capacities on both Qwen and Llama models. I-SHEEP achieves a maximum relative improvement of 78.2\% in the Alpaca Eval, 24.0\% in the MT Bench, and an absolute increase of 8.88\% in the IFEval accuracy over subsequent iterations in Qwen-1.5 72B model. Additionally, I-SHEEP surpasses the base model in various standard benchmark generation tasks, achieving an average improvement of 24.77\% in code generation tasks, 12.04\% in TrivialQA, and 20.29\% in SQuAD.

While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for attack, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |

It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear. In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM-assisted approaches for HDL generation struggle when handling complex tasks. We introduce a suite of hierarchical prompting techniques which facilitate efficient stepwise design methods, and develop a generalizable automation pipeline for the process. To evaluate these techniques, we present a benchmark set of hardware designs which have solutions with or without architectural hierarchy. Using these benchmarks, we compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs, including our own fine-tuned Code Llama-Verilog model. Our hierarchical methods automatically produce successful designs for complex hardware modules that standard flat prompting methods cannot achieve, allowing smaller open-source LLMs to compete with large proprietary models. Hierarchical prompting reduces HDL generation time and yields savings on LLM costs. Our experiments detail which LLMs are capable of which applications, and how to apply hierarchical methods in various modes. We explore case studies of generating complex cores using automatic scripted hierarchical prompts, including the first-ever LLM-designed processor with no human feedback.

The Case of Language-based Persuasion Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17435v4)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human choice prediction in economic contexts is crucial for applications in marketing, finance, public policy, and more. This task, however, is often constrained by the difficulties in acquiring human choice data. With most experimental economics studies focusing on simple choice settings, the AI community has explored whether LLMs can substitute for humans in these predictions and examined more complex experimental economics settings. However, a key question remains: can LLMs generate training data for human choice prediction? We explore this in language-based persuasion games, a complex economic setting involving natural language in strategic interactions. Our experiments show that models trained on LLM-generated data can effectively predict human behavior in these games and even outperform models trained on actual human data.</p></details> |  |

For instance, in medicine, effective analysis of diverse physiological signals is crucial for patient monitoring and clinical decision-making and yet highly challenging. We introduce MedTsLLM, a general multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that effectively integrates time series data and rich contextual information in the form of text to analyze physiological signals, performing three tasks with clinical relevance: semantic segmentation, boundary detection, and anomaly detection in time series. These critical tasks enable deeper analysis of physiological signals and can provide actionable insights for clinicians. We utilize a reprogramming layer to align embeddings of time series patches with a pretrained LLM's embedding space and make effective use of raw time series, in conjunction with textual context. Given the multivariate nature of medical datasets, we develop methods to handle multiple covariates. We additionally tailor the text prompt to include patient-specific information. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including deep learning models, other LLMs, and clinical methods across multiple medical domains, specifically electrocardiograms and respiratory waveforms. MedTsLLM presents a promising step towards harnessing the power of LLMs for medical time series analysis that can elevate data-driven tools for clinicians and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, MLHC 2024</p></details> |

They can also be used to introduce a diverse group discussion step in chatbot pipelines, enhancing the cultural sensitivity of the chatbot's responses. These applications, however, are predicated on the ability of AI agents to reliably adopt assigned personas and mimic human interactions. To see whether LLM agents satisfy these requirements, we examine AI agent ensembles engaged in cross-national collaboration and debate by analyzing their private responses and chat transcripts. Our findings suggest that multi-agent discussions can support collective AI decisions that more often reflect diverse perspectives, yet this effect is tempered by the agents' susceptibility to conformity due to perceived peer pressure and occasional challenges in maintaining consistent personas and opinions. Instructions that encourage debate in support of one's opinions rather than collaboration increase the rate of inconstancy. Without addressing the factors we identify, the full potential of multi-agent frameworks for producing more culturally diverse AI outputs or more realistic simulations of group decision-making may remain untapped.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We introduce an innovative multi-agent approach for ICD coding which mimics the ICD coding assignment procedure in real-world settings, comprising five distinct agents: the patient, physician, coder, reviewer, and adjuster. Each agent utilizes an LLM-based model tailored to their specific role within the coding process. We also integrate the system with Electronic Health Record (HER)'s SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment and plan) structure to boost the performances. We compare our method with a system of agents designed solely by LLMs and other strong baselines and evaluate it using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset. Our multi-agent coding framework significantly outperforms Zero-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and self-consistency with CoT (CoT-SC) in coding common and rare ICD codes. An ablation study validates the effectiveness of the designated agent roles. it also outperforms the LLM-designed agent system. Moreover, our method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art ICD coding methods that require extensive pre-training or fine-tuning, and outperforms them in rare code accuracy, and explainability. Additionally, we demonstrate the method's practical applicability by presenting its performance in scenarios not limited by the common or rare ICD code constraints.The proposed multi-agent method for ICD coding effectively mimics the real-world coding process and improves performance on both common and rare codes.</p></details> | 12pages |

Our methodology involved using a dataset from a human voting experiment to establish a baseline for human preferences and conducting a corresponding experiment with LLM agents. We observed that the choice of voting methods and the presentation order influenced LLM voting outcomes. We found that varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment with human choices. While the Chain-of-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process. We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and alignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings. Our findings indicate that LLMs may lead to less diverse collective outcomes and biased assumptions when used in voting scenarios, emphasizing the need for cautious integration of LLMs into democratic processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES)</p></details> |

Watermarking methods, particularly logit-based approaches, embed imperceptible identifiers into text to address these challenges. However, the widespread usage of watermarking across diverse LLMs has led to an inevitable issue known as watermark collision during common tasks, such as paraphrasing or translation. In this paper, we introduce watermark collision as a novel and general philosophy for watermark attacks, aimed at enhancing attack performance on top of any other attacking methods. We also provide a comprehensive demonstration that watermark collision poses a threat to all logit-based watermark algorithms, impacting not only specific attack scenarios but also downstream applications.</p></details> | Long Paper, 7 pages |

Inspired by the rise of large language models (LLMs) in various AI applications, there is a surge of work on LLM-based SRS. Despite their attractive performance, existing LLM-based SRS still exhibit some limitations, including neglecting intra-item relations, ignoring long-term collaborative knowledge and using inflexible architecture designs for adaption. To alleviate these issues, we propose an LLM-based SRS named MixRec. Built on top of coarse-grained adaption for capturing inter-item relations, MixRec is further enhanced with (1) context masking that models intra-item relations to help LLM better understand token and item semantics in the context of SRS, (2) collaborative knowledge injection that helps LLM incorporate long-term collaborative knowledge, and (3) a dynamic adaptive mixture-of-experts design that can flexibly choose expert architectures based on Bayesian optimization to better incorporate different sequential information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MixRec can effectively handle sequential recommendation in a dynamic and adaptive manner.</p></details> | 11 pages, 14 figures |

To address these issues, we introduce BioRAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Large Language Models (LLMs) framework. Our approach starts with parsing, indexing, and segmenting an extensive collection of 22 million scientific papers as the basic knowledge, followed by training a specialized embedding model tailored to this domain. Additionally, we enhance the vector retrieval process by incorporating a domain-specific knowledge hierarchy, which aids in modeling the intricate interrelationships among each query and context. For queries requiring the most current information, BioRAG deconstructs the question and employs an iterative retrieval process incorporated with the search engine for step-by-step reasoning. Rigorous experiments have demonstrated that our model outperforms fine-tuned LLM, LLM with search engines, and other scientific RAG frameworks across multiple life science question-answering tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

This task is especially challenging because modern large language models (LLMs) produce disinformation with human-like quality. Additionally, the diversity in prompting methods used to generate disinformation complicates accurate source attribution. These methods introduce domain-specific features that can mask the fundamental characteristics of the models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of model attribution as a domain generalization problem, where each prompting method represents a unique domain. We argue that an effective attribution model must be invariant to these domain-specific features. It should also be proficient in identifying the originating models across all scenarios, reflecting real-world detection challenges. To address this, we introduce a novel approach based on Supervised Contrastive Learning. This method is designed to enhance the model's robustness to variations in prompts and focuses on distinguishing between different source LLMs. We evaluate our model through rigorous experiments involving three common prompting methods: ``open-ended'', ``rewriting'', and ``paraphrasing'', and three advanced LLMs: ``llama 2'', ``chatgpt'', and ``vicuna''. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in model attribution tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse and unseen datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, accepted at DSAA 2024</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Enhanced Static Analysis for Precise Identification of Vulnerable OSS Versions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07321v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source software (OSS) has experienced a surge in popularity, attributed to its collaborative development model and cost-effective nature. However, the adoption of specific software versions in development projects may introduce security risks when these versions bring along vulnerabilities. Current methods of identifying vulnerable versions typically analyze and trace the code involved in vulnerability patches using static analysis with pre-defined rules. They then use syntactic-level code clone detection to identify the vulnerable versions. These methods are hindered by imprecisions due to (1) the inclusion of vulnerability-irrelevant code in the analysis and (2) the inadequacy of syntactic-level code clone detection. This paper presents Vercation, an approach designed to identify vulnerable versions of OSS written in C/C++. Vercation combines program slicing with a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify vulnerability-relevant code from vulnerability patches. It then backtraces historical commits to gather previous modifications of identified vulnerability-relevant code. We propose semantic-level code clone detection to compare the differences between pre-modification and post-modification code, thereby locating the vulnerability-introducing commit (vic) and enabling to identify the vulnerable versions between the patch commit and the vic. We curate a dataset linking 74 OSS vulnerabilities and 1013 versions to evaluate Vercation. On this dataset, our approach achieves the F1 score of 92.4%, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, Vercation detected 134 incorrect vulnerable OSS versions in NVD reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Advanced LLMs to Enhance Smaller LLMs: An Interpretable Knowledge Distillation Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07238v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or LlaMa 3 provide superior performance in complex human-like interactions. But they are costly, or too large for edge devices such as smartphones and harder to self-host, leading to security and privacy concerns. This paper introduces a novel interpretable knowledge distillation approach to enhance the performance of smaller, more economical LLMs that firms can self-host. We study this problem in the context of building a customer service agent aimed at achieving high customer satisfaction through goal-oriented dialogues. Unlike traditional knowledge distillation, where the "student" model learns directly from the "teacher" model's responses via fine-tuning, our interpretable "strategy" teaching approach involves the teacher providing strategies to improve the student's performance in various scenarios. This method alternates between a "scenario generation" step and a "strategies for improvement" step, creating a customized library of scenarios and optimized strategies for automated prompting. The method requires only black-box access to both student and teacher models; hence it can be used without manipulating model parameters. In our customer service application, the method improves performance, and the learned strategies are transferable to other LLMs and scenarios beyond the training set. The method's interpretabilty helps safeguard against potential harms through human audit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03626v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate these problems, we propose {\bf ELLA}, a tool for {\bf E}mpowering {\bf L}LMs for interpretable, accurate, and informative {\bf L}egal {\bf A}dvice. ELLA visually presents the correlation between legal articles and LLM's response by calculating their similarities, providing users with an intuitive legal basis for the responses. Besides, based on the users' queries, ELLA retrieves relevant legal articles and displays them to users. Users can interactively select legal articles for LLM to generate more accurate responses. ELLA also retrieves relevant legal cases for user reference. Our user study shows that presenting the legal basis for the response helps users understand better. The accuracy of LLM's responses also improves when users intervene in selecting legal articles for LLM. Providing relevant legal cases also aids individuals in obtaining comprehensive information.</p></details> |  |

Through controlled experiments, we find that the model's effective generation length is inherently bounded by the sample it has seen during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In other words, their output limitation is due to the scarcity of long-output examples in existing SFT datasets. To address this, we introduce AgentWrite, an agent-based pipeline that decomposes ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks, enabling off-the-shelf LLMs to generate coherent outputs exceeding 20,000 words. Leveraging AgentWrite, we construct LongWriter-6k, a dataset containing 6,000 SFT data with output lengths ranging from 2k to 32k words. By incorporating this dataset into model training, we successfully scale the output length of existing models to over 10,000 words while maintaining output quality. We also develop LongBench-Write, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating ultra-long generation capabilities. Our 9B parameter model, further improved through DPO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even much larger proprietary models. In general, our work demonstrates that existing long context LLM already possesses the potential for a larger output window--all you need is data with extended output during model alignment to unlock this capability.

Systematically analyzing their failures and effectively enhancing their performance remain significant challenges. This paper introduces the Re-TASK framework, a novel theoretical model that Revisits LLM Tasks from cApability, Skill, Knowledge perspectives, guided by the principles of Bloom's Taxonomy and Knowledge Space Theory. The Re-TASK framework provides a systematic methodology to deepen our understanding, evaluation, and enhancement of LLMs for domain-specific tasks. It explores the interplay among an LLM's capabilities, the knowledge it processes, and the skills it applies, elucidating how these elements are interconnected and impact task performance. Our application of the Re-TASK framework reveals that many failures in domain-specific tasks can be attributed to insufficient knowledge or inadequate skill adaptation. With this insight, we propose structured strategies for enhancing LLMs through targeted knowledge injection and skill adaptation. Specifically, we identify key capability items associated with tasks and employ a deliberately designed prompting strategy to enhance task performance, thereby reducing the need for extensive fine-tuning. Alternatively, we fine-tune the LLM using capability-specific instructions, further validating the efficacy of our framework. Experimental results confirm the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating substantial improvements in both the performance and applicability of LLMs.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

To address this issue, we propose SUBLLM, short for Subsampling-Upsampling-Bypass Large Language Model, an innovative architecture that extends the core decoder-only framework by incorporating subsampling, upsampling, and bypass modules. The subsampling modules are responsible for shortening the sequence, while the upsampling modules restore the sequence length, and the bypass modules enhance convergence. In comparison to LLaMA, the proposed SUBLLM exhibits significant enhancements in both training and inference speeds as well as memory usage, while maintaining competitive few-shot performance. During training, SUBLLM increases speeds by 26% and cuts memory by 10GB per GPU. In inference, it boosts speeds by up to 37% and reduces memory by 1GB per GPU. The training and inference speeds can be enhanced by 34% and 52% respectively when the context window is expanded to 8192.

A Case Study on Bar Charts with Varying Layouts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06837v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been adopted for a variety of visualizations tasks, but how far are we from perceptually aware LLMs that can predict human takeaways? Graphical perception literature has shown that human chart takeaways are sensitive to visualization design choices, such as spatial layouts. In this work, we examine the extent to which LLMs exhibit such sensitivity when generating takeaways, using bar charts with varying spatial layouts as a case study. We conducted three experiments and tested four common bar chart layouts: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. In Experiment 1, we identified the optimal configurations to generate meaningful chart takeaways by testing four LLMs, two temperature settings, nine chart specifications, and two prompting strategies. We found that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggled to generate semantically diverse and factually accurate takeaways. In Experiment 2, we used the optimal configurations to generate 30 chart takeaways each for eight visualizations across four layouts and two datasets in both zero-shot and one-shot settings. Compared to human takeaways, we found that the takeaways LLMs generated often did not match the types of comparisons made by humans. In Experiment 3, we examined the effect of chart context and data on LLM takeaways. We found that LLMs, unlike humans, exhibited variation in takeaway comparison types for different bar charts using the same bar layout. Overall, our case study evaluates the ability of LLMs to emulate human interpretations of data and points to challenges and opportunities in using LLMs to predict human chart takeaways.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (Proc.

To improve the reliability of LLMs, recent research has focused on uncertainty quantification to predict whether a response is correct or not. However, most uncertainty quantification methods have been evaluated on questions requiring a single clear answer, ignoring the existence of data uncertainty that arises from irreducible randomness. Instead, these methods only consider model uncertainty, which arises from a lack of knowledge. In this paper, we investigate previous uncertainty quantification methods under the presence of data uncertainty. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) proposing a new Multi-Answer Question Answering dataset, MAQA, consisting of world knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning tasks to evaluate uncertainty quantification regarding data uncertainty, and 2) assessing 5 uncertainty quantification methods of diverse white- and black-box LLMs. Our findings show that entropy and consistency-based methods estimate the model uncertainty well even under data uncertainty, while other methods for white- and black-box LLMs struggle depending on the tasks. Additionally, methods designed for white-box LLMs suffer from overconfidence in reasoning tasks compared to simple knowledge queries. We believe our observations will pave the way for future work on uncertainty quantification in realistic setting.</p></details> |  |

Despite the potential of RTL code generation with natural language, it remains error-prone and limited to relatively small modules because of the substantial semantic gap between natural language expressions and hardware design intent. In response to the limitations, we propose a methodology that reduces the semantic gaps by utilizing C/C++ for generating hardware designs via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools. Basically, we build a set of C-to-HLS optimization strategies catering to various code patterns, such as nested loops and local arrays. Then, we apply these strategies to sequential C/C++ code through in-context learning, which provides the LLMs with exemplary C/C++ to HLS prompts. With this approach, HLS designs can be generated effectively. Since LLMs still face problems in determining the optimized pragma parameters precisely, we have a design space exploration (DSE) tool integrated for pragma parameter tuning. Furthermore, we also employ profiling tools to pinpoint the performance bottlenecks within a program and selectively convert bottleneck components to HLS code for hardware acceleration. By combining the LLM-based profiling, C/C++ to HLS translation, and DSE, we have established HLSPilot, the first LLM-enabled high-level synthesis framework, which can fully automate the high-level application acceleration on hybrid CPU-FPGA architectures. According to our experiments on real-world application benchmarks, HLSPilot achieve comparable performance in general and can even outperform manually crafted counterparts, thereby underscoring the substantial promise of LLM-assisted hardware designs.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) learn extensive knowledge from large corpora with powerful context modeling, which is ideal for mitigating the limitations of previous methods. Directly fine-tuning LLMs offers great capability but comes at the cost of huge time and memory consumption, while utilizing frozen LLMs yields suboptimal results. In this work, we aim to leverage LLMs for KGC effectively and efficiently. We capture the context-aware hidden states of knowledge triples by employing prompts to stimulate the intermediate layers of LLMs. We then train a data-efficient classifier on these hidden states to harness the inherent capabilities of frozen LLMs in KGC. We also generate entity descriptions with subgraph sampling on KGs, reducing the ambiguity of triplets and enriching the knowledge representation.

However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in CoLM 2024</p></details> |

However, the code generated on basis of a so called "prompt" by the programmer does not always meet accepted security standards. On the one hand, this may be due to lack of best-practice examples in the training data. On the other hand, the actual quality of the programmers prompt appears to influence whether generated code contains weaknesses or not. In this paper we analyse 4 major LLMs with respect to the security of generated code. We do this on basis of a case study for the Python and Javascript language, using the MITRE CWE catalogue as the guiding security definition. Our results show that using different prompting techniques, some LLMs initially generate 65% code which is deemed insecure by a trained security engineer. On the other hand almost all analysed LLMs will eventually generate code being close to 100% secure with increasing manual guidance of a skilled engineer.</p></details> |  |

Two sets of experiments were conducted using cosine similarity and next sentence/token prediction as experimental methods. The results in experiment 1 showed that, both models interpret some as pragmatic implicature not all in the absence of context, aligning with human language processing. In experiment 2, in which Question Under Discussion (QUD) was presented as a contextual cue, BERT showed consistent performance regardless of types of QUDs, while GPT-2 encountered processing difficulties since a certain type of QUD required pragmatic inference for implicature. The findings revealed that, in terms of theoretical approaches, BERT inherently incorporates pragmatic implicature not all within the term some, adhering to Default model (Levinson, 2000). In contrast, GPT-2 seems to encounter processing difficulties in inferring pragmatic implicature within context, consistent with Context-driven model (Sperber and Wilson, 2002).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This research was presented at the Association for Computational Linguistics conference, held on August 11-16</p></details> |

Traditional methods, particularly classical machine learning models, struggle with these predictions because they cannot effectively process and interpret extensive textual data contained in earnings reports and often overlook nuances that influence market movements. This paper introduces an advanced approach by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) instruction fine-tuned with a novel combination of instruction-based techniques and quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA) compression. Our methodology integrates 'base factors', such as financial metric growth and earnings transcripts, with 'external factors', including recent market indices performances and analyst grades, to create a rich, supervised dataset. This comprehensive dataset enables our models to achieve superior predictive performance in terms of accuracy, weighted F1, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), especially evident in the comparison with benchmarks such as GPT-4. We specifically highlight the efficacy of the llama-3-8b-Instruct-4bit model, which showcases significant improvements over baseline models. The paper also discusses the potential of expanding the output capabilities to include a 'Hold' option and extending the prediction horizon, aiming to accommodate various investment styles and time frames. This study not only demonstrates the power of integrating cutting-edge AI with fine-tuned financial data but also paves the way for future research in enhancing AI-driven financial analysis tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 6th International Conference on Data-driven Optimization of Complex Systems</p></details> |

Automated resume screening systems often encompass a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs) based agent framework for resume screening, aimed at enhancing efficiency and time management in recruitment processes. Our framework is distinct in its ability to efficiently summarize and grade each resume from a large dataset. Moreover, it utilizes LLM agents for decision-making. To evaluate our framework, we constructed a dataset from actual resumes and simulated a resume screening process. Subsequently, the outcomes of the simulation experiment were compared and subjected to detailed analysis. The results demonstrate that our automated resume screening framework is 11 times faster than traditional manual methods. Furthermore, by fine-tuning the LLMs, we observed a significant improvement in the F1 score, reaching 87.73\%, during the resume sentence classification phase. In the resume summarization and grading phase, our fine-tuned model surpassed the baseline performance of the GPT-3.5 model. Analysis of the decision-making efficacy of the LLM agents in the final offer stage further underscores the potential of LLM agents in transforming resume screening processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by Journal of Information Processing,(2024), 18 pages, 19 figures</p></details> |

Existing approaches often necessitate expensive language model retraining and limited adaptability. Additionally, the current focus on zero-shot performance improvements offers insufficient guidance for task-specific tuning. We propose CROME, an efficient vision-language instruction tuning framework. It features a novel gated cross-modal adapter that effectively combines visual and textual representations prior to input into a frozen LLM. This lightweight adapter, trained with minimal parameters, enables efficient cross-modal understanding. Notably, CROME demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on standard visual question answering and instruction-following benchmarks. Moreover, it yields fine-tuning with exceptional parameter efficiency, competing with task-specific specialist state-of-the-art methods. CROME demonstrates the potential of pre-LM alignment for building scalable, adaptable, and parameter-efficient multimodal models.</p></details> |  |

Our study investigates this issue by developing a framework to systematically study and quantify position bias using metrics such as repetitional consistency, positional consistency, and positional fairness. We conduct experiments with 9 judge models across 22 tasks from the MTBench and DevBench benchmarks and nearly 40 answer-generating models, generating approximately 80,000 evaluation instances. This comprehensive assessment reveals significant variations in bias across judges and tasks. Although GPT-4 often excels in positional consistency and fairness, some more cost-effective models perform comparably or even better in specific tasks, highlighting essential trade-offs between consistency, fairness, and cost. Our results also demonstrate high consistency of judgment across repetitions, confirming that position bias is not due to random variations. This research significantly contributes to the field by introducing new concepts for understanding position bias and providing a multi-dimensional framework for evaluation. These insights guide the selection of optimal judge models, enhance benchmark design, and lay the foundation for future research into effective debiasing strategies, ultimately enhancing the reliability of LLM evaluators.</p></details> | <details><summary>70 pa...</summary><p>70 pages, around 200 figures and subfigures</p></details> |

Utilizing the emotion appraisal theory from psychology, we propose to evaluate the empathy ability of LLMs, \ie, how their feelings change when presented with specific situations. After a careful and comprehensive survey, we collect a dataset containing over 400 situations that have proven effective in eliciting the eight emotions central to our study. Categorizing the situations into 36 factors, we conduct a human evaluation involving more than 1,200 subjects worldwide. With the human evaluation results as references, our evaluation includes seven LLMs, covering both commercial and open-source models, including variations in model sizes, featuring the latest iterations, such as GPT-4, Mixtral-8x22B, and LLaMA-3.1. We find that, despite several misalignments, LLMs can generally respond appropriately to certain situations.

However, how to employ strategies, a set of motivational interviewing (MI) skills, to generate therapeutic-adherent conversations with explainability is underexplored. We propose an approach called strategy-aware dialogue generation with Chain-of-Strategy (CoS) planning, which first predicts MI strategies as reasoning and utilizes these strategies to guide the subsequent dialogue generation. It brings the potential for controllable and explainable generation in psychotherapy by aligning the generated MI dialogues with therapeutic strategies. Extensive experiments including automatic and human evaluations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the MI strategy. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs in producing strategically aligned dialogues and suggest directions for practical applications in psychotherapeutic settings.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-Scale Representation Learning for Image Restoration with State-Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10145v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration endeavors to reconstruct a high-quality, detail-rich image from a degraded counterpart, which is a pivotal process in photography and various computer vision systems. In real-world scenarios, different types of degradation can cause the loss of image details at various scales and degrade image contrast. Existing methods predominantly rely on CNN and Transformer to capture multi-scale representations. However, these methods are often limited by the high computational complexity of Transformers and the constrained receptive field of CNN, which hinder them from achieving superior performance and efficiency in image restoration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Scale State-Space Model-based (MS-Mamba) for efficient image restoration that enhances the capacity for multi-scale representation learning through our proposed global and regional SSM modules. Additionally, an Adaptive Gradient Block (AGB) and a Residual Fourier Block (RFB) are proposed to improve the network's detail extraction capabilities by capturing gradients in various directions and facilitating learning details in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on nine public benchmarks across four classic image restoration tasks, image deraining, dehazing, denoising, and low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational complexity. The source code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Multi-resolution and Multi-scale Attention for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09912v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater imagery is often compromised by factors such as color distortion and low contrast, posing challenges for high-level vision tasks. Recent underwater image restoration (UIR) methods either analyze the input image at full resolution, resulting in spatial richness but contextual weakness, or progressively from high to low resolution, yielding reliable semantic information but reduced spatial accuracy. Here, we propose a lightweight multi-stage network called Lit-Net that focuses on multi-resolution and multi-scale image analysis for restoring underwater images while retaining original resolution during the first stage, refining features in the second, and focusing on reconstruction in the final stage. Our novel encoder block utilizes parallel $1\times1$ convolution layers to capture local information and speed up operations. Further, we incorporate a modified weighted color channel-specific $l_1$ loss ($cl_1$) function to recover color and detail information. Extensive experimentations on publicly available datasets suggest our model's superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvement in qualitative and quantitative measures, such as $29.477$ dB PSNR ($1.92\%$ improvement) and $0.851$ SSIM ($2.87\%$ improvement) on the EUVP dataset. The contributions of Lit-Net offer a more robust approach to underwater image enhancement and super-resolution, which is of considerable importance for underwater autonomous vehicles and surveillance.

| **[Re-boosting Self-Collaboration Parallel Prompt GAN for Unsupervised Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09241v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised restoration approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a promising solution without requiring paired datasets. Yet, these GAN-based approaches struggle to surpass the performance of conventional unsupervised GAN-based frameworks without significantly modifying model structures or increasing the computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for existing restoration models. This strategy utilizes information from the previous stage as feedback to guide subsequent stages, achieving significant performance improvement without increasing the framework's inference complexity. The SC strategy comprises a prompt learning (PL) module and a restorer ($Res$). It iteratively replaces the previous less powerful fixed restorer $\overline{Res}$ in the PL module with a more powerful $Res$. The enhanced PL module generates better pseudo-degraded/clean image pairs, leading to a more powerful $Res$ for the next iteration. Our SC can significantly improve the $Res$'s performance by over 1.5 dB without adding extra parameters or computational complexity during inference. Meanwhile, existing self-ensemble (SE) and our SC strategies enhance the performance of pre-trained restorers from different perspectives. As SE increases computational complexity during inference, we propose a re-boosting module to the SC (Reb-SC) to improve the SC strategy further by incorporating SE into SC without increasing inference time. This approach further enhances the restorer's performance by approximately 0.3 dB. Extensive experimental results on restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art unsupervised restoration methods.

| **[Multi-task Image Restoration Guided By Robust DINO Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01677v3)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task image restoration has gained significant interest due to its inherent versatility and efficiency compared to its single-task counterpart. However, performance decline is observed with an increase in the number of tasks, primarily attributed to the restoration model's challenge in handling different tasks with distinct natures at the same time. Thus, a perspective emerged aiming to explore the degradation-insensitive semantic commonalities among different degradation tasks. In this paper, we observe that the features of DINOv2 can effectively model semantic information and are independent of degradation factors. Motivated by this observation, we propose \mbox{\textbf{DINO-IR}}, a multi-task image restoration approach leveraging robust features extracted from DINOv2 to solve multi-task image restoration simultaneously. We first propose a pixel-semantic fusion (PSF) module to dynamically fuse DINOV2's shallow features containing pixel-level information and deep features containing degradation-independent semantic information. To guide the restoration model with the features of DINOv2, we develop a DINO-Restore adaption and fusion module to adjust the channel of fused features from PSF and then integrate them with the features from the restoration model. By formulating these modules into a unified deep model, we propose a DINO perception contrastive loss to constrain the model training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DINO-IR performs favorably against existing multi-task image restoration approaches in various tasks by a large margin. The source codes and trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Variational Translator for Bridging Image Restoration and High-Level Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08149v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research tries to extend image restoration capabilities from human perception to machine perception, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks in degraded environments. These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAIR: Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08091v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration involves recovering a high-quality clean image from its degraded version, which is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of learning models capable of addressing various degradations simultaneously, i.e., the All-in-One image restoration models. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters facing images with different degradation types, which causes the model to be forced to trade off between degradation types, therefore impair the total performance. To solve this problem, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based plug-in-and-play method that dynamically generated parameters for the corresponding networks based on the contents of input images. HAIR consists of 2 main components: Classifier (Cl) and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). To be more specific, the Classifier is a simple image classification network which is used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image; And the HSNs can be seen as a simple Fully-connected Neural Network that receive the GIV and output parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments shows that incorporating HAIR into the architectures can significantly improve the performance of different models on image restoration tasks at a low cost, \textbf{although HAIR only generate parameters and haven't change these models' logical structures at all.} With incorporating HAIR into the popular architecture Restormer, our method obtains superior or at least comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on a range of image restoration tasks. \href{https://github.com/toummHus/HAIR}{\textcolor{blue}{$\underline{\textbf{Code and pre-trained checkpoints are available here.}}$}}</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Existing all-in-one UHD image restoration methods usually boost the model's performance by introducing prompt or customized dynamized networks for different degradation types. For the inference stage, it might be friendly, but in the training stage, since the model encounters multiple degraded images of different quality in an epoch, these cluttered learning objectives might be information pollution for the model. To address this problem, we propose a new training paradigm for general image restoration models, which we name \textbf{Review Learning}, which enables image restoration models to be capable enough to handle multiple types of degradation without prior knowledge and prompts. This approach begins with sequential training of an image restoration model on several degraded datasets, combined with a review mechanism that enhances the image restoration model's memory for several previous classes of degraded datasets. In addition, we design a lightweight all-purpose image restoration network that can efficiently reason about degraded images with 4K ($3840 \times 2160$) resolution on a single consumer-grade GPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet based inpainting detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06429v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement in image editing tools, manipulating digital images has become alarmingly easy. Inpainting, which is used to remove objects or fill in parts of an image, serves as a powerful tool for both image restoration and forgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting image inpainting forgeries by combining DT-CWT with Hierarchical Feature segmentation and with noise inconsistency analysis. The DT-CWT offers several advantages for this task, including inherent shift-invariance, which makes it robust to minor manipulations during the inpainting process, and directional selectivity, which helps capture subtle artifacts introduced by inpainting in specific frequency bands and orientations. By first applying color image segmentation and then analyzing for each segment, noise inconsistency obtained via DT-CW we can identify patterns indicative of inpainting forgeries. The proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark dataset created for this purpose and is compared with existing forgery detection techniques. Our approach demonstrates superior results compared with SOTA in detecting inpainted images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Optimal Transport: A Practical Algorithm for Photo-realistic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02342v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an image restoration algorithm that can control the perceptual quality and/or the mean square error (MSE) of any pre-trained model, trading one over the other at test time. Our algorithm is few-shot: Given about a dozen images restored by the model, it can significantly improve the perceptual quality and/or the MSE of the model for newly restored images without further training. Our approach is motivated by a recent theoretical result that links between the minimum MSE (MMSE) predictor and the predictor that minimizes the MSE under a perfect perceptual quality constraint. Specifically, it has been shown that the latter can be obtained by optimally transporting the output of the former, such that its distribution matches the source data. Thus, to improve the perceptual quality of a predictor that was originally trained to minimize MSE, we approximate the optimal transport by a linear transformation in the latent space of a variational auto-encoder, which we compute in closed-form using empirical means and covariances. Going beyond the theory, we find that applying the same procedure on models that were initially trained to achieve high perceptual quality, typically improves their perceptual quality even further. And by interpolating the results with the original output of the model, we can improve their MSE on the expense of perceptual quality. We illustrate our method on a variety of degradations applied to general content images of arbitrary dimensions.</p></details> |  |

It is demonstrated that our algorithms converge to the unique least-norm solution of the matrix equation when it is consistent and their convergence rate is faster than that of the randomized block Kaczmarz method (ME-RBK). Moreover, the block Kaczmarz method (ME-BK) for solving the matrix equation $AXB=C$ is investigated and it is found that the ME-BK method converges to the solution $A^{+}CB^{+}+X^{0}-A^{+}AX^{0}BB^{+}$ when it is consistent. The numerical tests verify the theoretical results and the methods presented in this paper are applied to the color image restoration problem to obtain satisfactory restored images.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a Physical Prior Guided Cooperative Learning (P2GCL) framework to jointly enhance atmospheric turbulence strength estimation and infrared image restoration. P2GCL involves a cyclic collaboration between two models, i.e., a TMNet measures turbulence strength and outputs the refractive index structure constant (Cn2) as a physical prior, a TRNet conducts infrared image sequence restoration based on Cn2 and feeds the restored images back to the TMNet to boost the measurement accuracy. A novel Cn2-guided frequency loss function and a physical constraint loss are introduced to align the training process with physical theories. Experiments demonstrate P2GCL achieves the best performance for both turbulence strength estimation (improving Cn2 MAE by 0.0156, enhancing R2 by 0.1065) and image restoration (enhancing PSNR by 0.2775 dB), validating the significant impact of physical prior guided cooperative learning.</p></details> | 21 |

However, we find that previous approaches rely on the digital representation from single color model with a specific mapping function, a.k.a., color space, during the colorization pipeline. In this paper, we first investigate the modeling of different color spaces, and find each of them exhibiting distinctive characteristics with unique distribution of colors. The complementarity among multiple color spaces leads to benefits for the image colorization task. We present MultiColor, a new learning-based approach to automatically colorize grayscale images that combines clues from multiple color spaces. Specifically, we employ a set of dedicated colorization modules for individual color space. Within each module, a transformer decoder is first employed to refine color query embeddings and then a color mapper produces color channel prediction using the embeddings and semantic features. With these predicted color channels representing various color spaces, a complementary network is designed to exploit the complementarity and generate pleasing and reasonable colorized images. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Existing diffusion-based image restoration algorithms exploit pre-trained diffusion models to leverage data priors, yet they still preserve elements inherited from the unconditional generation paradigm. These strategies initiate the denoising process with pure white noise and incorporate random noise at each generative step, leading to over-smoothed results. In this paper, we present a refined paradigm for diffusion-based image restoration. Specifically, we opt for a sample consistent with the measurement identity at each generative step, exploiting the sampling selection as an avenue for output stability and enhancement. The number of candidate samples used for selection is adaptively determined based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the timestep. Additionally, we start the restoration process with an initialization combined with the measurement signal, providing supplementary information to better align the generative process. Extensive experimental results and analyses validate that our proposed method significantly enhances image restoration performance while consuming negligible additional computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM Multimedia 2024 Oral</p></details> |

MCGF establishes a joint optimization between image restoration and geo-localization using denoising diffusion models. For image restoration, MCGF incorporates a shared encoder and a lightweight restoration module to help the backbone eliminate weather-specific information. For geo-localization, MCGF uses EVA-02 as a backbone for feature extraction, with cross-entropy loss for training and cosine distance for testing.

Historically, most methodologies have predominantly utilized spatial domain recovery, offering limited consideration to the potentialities of the frequency domain. Additionally, there has been a lack of a unified perspective towards low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, complicating and impeding the optimization of image processing. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology that leverages the frequency domain to improve and unify the handling of exposure correction tasks. Our method introduces Holistic Frequency Attention and Dynamic Frequency Feed-Forward Network, which replace conventional correlation computation in the spatial-domain. They form a foundational building block that facilitates a U-shaped Holistic Dynamic Frequency Transformer as a filter to extract global information and dynamically select important frequency bands for image restoration. Complementing this, we employ a Laplacian pyramid to decompose images into distinct frequency bands, followed by multiple restorers, each tuned to recover specific frequency-band information. The pyramid fusion allows a more detailed and nuanced image restoration process. Ultimately, our structure unifies the three tasks of low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, enabling comprehensive treatment of all classical exposure errors. Benchmarking on mainstream datasets for these tasks, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, paving the way for more sophisticated and unified solutions in exposure correction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contribution-based Low-Rank Adaptation with Pre-training Model for Real Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01099v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pre-trained model and efficient parameter tuning have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and high-level computer vision with the aid of masked modeling and prompt tuning. In low-level computer vision, however, there have been limited investigations on pre-trained models and even efficient fine-tuning strategy has not yet been explored despite its importance and benefit in various real-world tasks such as alleviating memory inflation issue when integrating new tasks on AI edge devices. Here, we propose a novel efficient parameter tuning approach dubbed contribution-based low-rank adaptation (CoLoRA) for multiple image restorations along with effective pre-training method with random order degradations (PROD). Unlike prior arts that tune all network parameters, our CoLoRA effectively fine-tunes small amount of parameters by leveraging LoRA (low-rank adaptation) for each new vision task with our contribution-based method to adaptively determine layer by layer capacity for that task to yield comparable performance to full tuning. Furthermore, our PROD strategy allows to extend the capability of pre-trained models with improved performance as well as robustness to bridge synthetic pre-training and real-world fine-tuning. Our CoLoRA with PROD has demonstrated its superior performance in various image restoration tasks across diverse degradation types on both synthetic and real-world datasets for known and novel tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 15 figures, for homepage see this url : https://janeyeon.github.io/colora/</p></details> |

This is worsened by lack of ground truth data of clean scenes without water. Diffusion priors have emerged as strong image restoration priors. However, they are often trained with a dataset of the desired restored output, which is not available in our case. We also observe that using only color data is insufficient, and therefore augment the prior with a depth channel. We train an unconditional diffusion model prior on the joint space of color and depth, using standard RGBD datasets of natural outdoor scenes in air. Using this prior together with a novel guidance method based on the underwater image formation model, we generate posterior samples of clean images, removing the water effects. Even though our prior did not see any underwater images during training, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image restoration on very challenging scenes. Our code, models and data are available on the project website.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

| **[A Prior Embedding-Driven Architecture for Long Distance Blind Iris Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00210v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind iris images, which result from unknown degradation during the process of iris recognition at long distances, often lead to decreased iris recognition rates. Currently, little existing literature offers a solution to this problem. In response, we propose a prior embedding-driven architecture for long distance blind iris recognition. We first proposed a blind iris image restoration network called Iris-PPRGAN. To effectively restore the texture of the blind iris, Iris-PPRGAN includes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used as a Prior Decoder, and a DNN used as the encoder. To extract iris features more efficiently, we then proposed a robust iris classifier by modifying the bottleneck module of InsightFace, which called Insight-Iris. A low-quality blind iris image is first restored by Iris-PPRGAN, then the restored iris image undergoes recognition via Insight-Iris. Experimental results on the public CASIA-Iris-distance dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly superior results to state-of-the-art blind iris restoration methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, Specifically, the recognition rate for long-distance blind iris images reaches 90% after processing with our methods, representing an improvement of approximately ten percentage points compared to images without restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restore-RWKV: Efficient and Effective Medical Image Restoration with RWKV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11087v2)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have revolutionized medical image restoration, but the quadratic complexity still poses limitations for their application to high-resolution medical images. The recent advent of RWKV in the NLP field has attracted much attention as it can process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Restore-RWKV achieves superior performance across various medical image restoration tasks, including MRI image super-resolution, CT image denoising, PET image synthesis, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

| **[UniProcessor: A Text-induced Unified Low-level Image Processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20928v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image processing, including image restoration, image enhancement, etc., involves generating a high-quality clean image from a degraded input. Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance for various image processing tasks in terms of single-task conditions. However, they require to train separate models for different degradations and levels, which limits the generalization abilities of these models and restricts their applications in real-world. In this paper, we propose a text-induced unified image processor for low-level vision tasks, termed UniProcessor, which can effectively process various degradation types and levels, and support multimodal control. Specifically, our UniProcessor encodes degradation-specific information with the subject prompt and process degradations with the manipulation prompt. These context control features are injected into the UniProcessor backbone via cross-attention to control the processing procedure. For automatic subject-prompt generation, we further build a vision-language model for general-purpose low-level degradation perception via instruction tuning techniques. Our UniProcessor covers 30 degradation types, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our UniProcessor can well process these degradations without additional training or tuning and outperforms other competing methods. Moreover, with the help of degradation-aware context control, our UniProcessor first shows the ability to individually handle a single distortion in an image with multiple degradations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation and develop empirically effective algorithms for solving noiseless and noisy image inpainting tasks. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments across diverse mask settings.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Multi-Expert Adaptive Selection: Task-Balancing for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19139v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of a single image restoration framework to achieve multi-task image restoration has garnered significant attention from researchers. However, several practical challenges remain, including meeting the specific and simultaneous demands of different tasks, balancing relationships between tasks, and effectively utilizing task correlations in model design. To address these challenges, this paper explores a multi-expert adaptive selection mechanism. We begin by designing a feature representation method that accounts for both the pixel channel level and the global level, encompassing low-frequency and high-frequency components of the image. Based on this method, we construct a multi-expert selection and ensemble scheme. This scheme adaptively selects the most suitable expert from the expert library according to the content of the input image and the prompts of the current task. It not only meets the individualized needs of different tasks but also achieves balance and optimization across tasks. By sharing experts, our design promotes interconnections between different tasks, thereby enhancing overall performance and resource utilization. Additionally, the multi-expert mechanism effectively eliminates irrelevant experts, reducing interference from them and further improving the effectiveness and accuracy of image restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is both effective and superior to existing approaches, highlighting its potential for practical applications in multi-task image restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dilated Strip Attention Network for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18613v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a long-standing task that seeks to recover the latent sharp image from its deteriorated counterpart. Due to the robust capacity of self-attention to capture long-range dependencies, transformer-based methods or some attention-based convolutional neural networks have demonstrated promising results on many image restoration tasks in recent years. However, existing attention modules encounters limited receptive fields or abundant parameters. In order to integrate contextual information more effectively and efficiently, in this paper, we propose a dilated strip attention network (DSAN) for image restoration. Specifically, to gather more contextual information for each pixel from its neighboring pixels in the same row or column, a dilated strip attention (DSA) mechanism is elaborately proposed. By employing the DSA operation horizontally and vertically, each location can harvest the contextual information from a much wider region. In addition, we utilize multi-scale receptive fields across different feature groups in DSA to improve representation learning. Extensive experiments show that our DSAN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on several image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RestoreAgent: Autonomous Image Restoration Agent via Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18035v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural images captured by mobile devices often suffer from multiple types of degradation, such as noise, blur, and low light. Traditional image restoration methods require manual selection of specific tasks, algorithms, and execution sequences, which is time-consuming and may yield suboptimal results. All-in-one models, though capable of handling multiple tasks, typically support only a limited range and often produce overly smooth, low-fidelity outcomes due to their broad data distribution fitting. To address these challenges, we first define a new pipeline for restoring images with multiple degradations, and then introduce RestoreAgent, an intelligent image restoration system leveraging multimodal large language models. RestoreAgent autonomously assesses the type and extent of degradation in input images and performs restoration through (1) determining the appropriate restoration tasks, (2) optimizing the task sequence, (3) selecting the most suitable models, and (4) executing the restoration. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of RestoreAgent in handling complex degradation, surpassing human experts. Furthermore, the system modular design facilitates the fast integration of new tasks and models, enhancing its flexibility and scalability for various applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restoring Images in Adverse Weather Conditions via Histogram Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10172v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based image restoration methods in adverse weather have achieved significant progress. Most of them use self-attention along the channel dimension or within spatially fixed-range blocks to reduce computational load. However, such a compromise results in limitations in capturing long-range spatial features. Inspired by the observation that the weather-induced degradation factors mainly cause similar occlusion and brightness, in this work, we propose an efficient Histogram Transformer (Histoformer) for restoring images affected by adverse weather. It is powered by a mechanism dubbed histogram self-attention, which sorts and segments spatial features into intensity-based bins. Self-attention is then applied across bins or within each bin to selectively focus on spatial features of dynamic range and process similar degraded pixels of the long range together. To boost histogram self-attention, we present a dynamic-range convolution enabling conventional convolution to conduct operation over similar pixels rather than neighbor pixels. We also observe that the common pixel-wise losses neglect linear association and correlation between output and ground-truth. Thus, we propose to leverage the Pearson correlation coefficient as a loss function to enforce the recovered pixels following the identical order as ground-truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our proposed method. We have released the codes in Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 10MB</p></details> |

Nevertheless, state-of-the-art inpainting methods are mainly designed for nature images and cannot correctly recover text within scene text images, and training existing models on the scene text images cannot fix the issues. In this work, we identify the visual-text inpainting task to achieve high-quality scene text image restoration and text completion: Given a scene text image with unknown missing regions and the corresponding text with unknown missing characters, we aim to complete the missing information in both images and text by leveraging their complementary information. Intuitively, the input text, even if damaged, contains language priors of the contents within the images and can guide the image inpainting. Meanwhile, the scene text image includes the appearance cues of the characters that could benefit text recovery. To this end, we design the cross-modal predictive interaction (CLII) model containing two branches, i.e., ImgBranch and TxtBranch, for scene text inpainting and text completion, respectively while leveraging their complementary effectively. Moreover, we propose to embed our model into the SOTA scene text spotting method and significantly enhance its robustness against missing pixels, which demonstrates the practicality of the newly developed task. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we construct three real datasets based on existing text-related datasets, containing 1838 images and covering three scenarios with curved, incidental, and styled texts, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms baselines significantly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Prior-Based Amortized Variational Inference for Noisy Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16125v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on inverse problems have proposed posterior samplers that leverage the pre-trained diffusion models as powerful priors. These attempts have paved the way for using diffusion models in a wide range of inverse problems. However, the existing methods entail computationally demanding iterative sampling procedures and optimize a separate solution for each measurement, which leads to limited scalability and lack of generalization capability across unseen samples. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion prior-based Amortized Variational Inference (DAVI) that solves inverse problems with a diffusion prior from an amortized variational inference perspective. Specifically, instead of separate measurement-wise optimization, our amortized inference learns a function that directly maps measurements to the implicit posterior distributions of corresponding clean data, enabling a single-step posterior sampling even for unseen measurements. Extensive experiments on image restoration tasks, e.g., Gaussian deblur, 4$\times$ super-resolution, and box inpainting with two benchmark datasets, demonstrate our approach's superior performance over strong baselines.

| **[HPPP: Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point Algorithms and Applications to Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13120v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preconditioned Proximal Point (PPP) algorithms provide a unified framework for splitting methods in image restoration. Recent advancements with RED (Regularization by Denoising) and PnP (Plug-and-Play) priors have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this domain, emphasizing the need for a meaningful particular solution. However, degenerate PPP algorithms typically exhibit weak convergence in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, leading to uncertain solutions. To address this issue, we propose the Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence properties of Halpern iteration to achieve a particular solution. Based on the implicit regularization defined by gradient RED, we further introduce the Gradient REgularization by Denoising via HPPP called GraRED-HP3 algorithm. The HPPP algorithm is shown to have the regularity converging to a particular solution by a toy example. Additionally, experiments in image deblurring and inpainting validate the effectiveness of GraRED-HP3, showing it surpasses classical methods such as Chambolle-Pock (CP), PPP, RED, and RED-PRO.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffLoss: unleashing diffusion model as constraint for training image restoration network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19030v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to enhance low quality images, producing high quality images that exhibit natural visual characteristics and fine semantic attributes. Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful technique for image generation, and it has been explicitly employed as a backbone in image restoration tasks, yielding excellent results. However, it suffers from the drawbacks of slow inference speed and large model parameters due to its intrinsic characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective that implicitly leverages the diffusion model to assist the training of image restoration network, called DiffLoss, which drives the restoration results to be optimized for naturalness and semantic-aware visual effect. To achieve this, we utilize the mode coverage capability of the diffusion model to approximate the distribution of natural images and explore its ability to capture image semantic attributes. On the one hand, we extract intermediate noise to leverage its modeling capability of the distribution of natural images, which serves as a naturalness-oriented optimization space. On the other hand, we utilize the bottleneck features of diffusion model to harness its semantic attributes serving as a constraint on semantic level. By combining these two designs, the overall loss function is able to improve the perceptual quality of image restoration, resulting in visually pleasing and semantically enhanced outcomes. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on various common image restoration tasks and benchmarks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the visual quality and semantic perception of the restoration network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning CT Image Restoration using System Blur and Noise Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14983v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The restoration of images affected by blur and noise has been widely studied and has broad potential for applications including in medical imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT). Although the blur and noise in CT images can be attributed to a variety of system factors, these image properties can often be modeled and predicted accurately and used in classical restoration approaches for deconvolution and denoising. In classical approaches, simultaneous deconvolution and denoising can be challenging and often represent competing goals. Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated the potential to enhance image quality beyond classic limits; however, most deep learning models attempt a blind restoration problem and base their restoration on image inputs alone without direct knowledge of the image noise and blur properties. In this work, we present a method that leverages both degraded image inputs and a characterization of the system blur and noise to combine modeling and deep learning approaches. Different methods to integrate these auxiliary inputs are presented. Namely, an input-variant and a weight-variant approach wherein the auxiliary inputs are incorporated as a parameter vector before and after the convolutional block, respectively, allowing easy integration into any CNN architecture. The proposed model shows superior performance compared to baseline models lacking auxiliary inputs. Evaluations are based on the average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), selected examples of good and poor performance for varying approaches, and an input space analysis to assess the effect of different noise and blur on performance. Results demonstrate the efficacy of providing a deep learning model with auxiliary inputs, representing system blur and noise characteristics, to enhance the performance of the model in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual High-Order Total Variation Model for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14868v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images are typically characterized by color cast, haze, blurring, and uneven illumination due to the selective absorption and scattering when light propagates through the water, which limits their practical applications. Underwater image enhancement and restoration (UIER) is one crucial mode to improve the visual quality of underwater images. However, most existing UIER methods concentrate on enhancing contrast and dehazing, rarely pay attention to the local illumination differences within the image caused by illumination variations, thus introducing some undesirable artifacts and unnatural color. To address this issue, an effective variational framework is proposed based on an extended underwater image formation model (UIFM). Technically, dual high-order regularizations are successfully integrated into the variational model to acquire smoothed local ambient illuminance and structure-revealed reflectance in a unified manner. In our proposed framework, the weight factors-based color compensation is combined with the color balance to compensate for the attenuated color channels and remove the color cast. In particular, the local ambient illuminance with strong robustness is acquired by performing the local patch brightest pixel estimation and an improved gamma correction. Additionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm relying on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to accelerate the solution of the proposed variational model. Considerable experiments on three real-world underwater image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with regard to visual quality and quantitative assessments. Moreover, the proposed method can also be extended to outdoor image dehazing, low-light image enhancement, and some high-level vision tasks.

We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining.

Specifically, we first dig into the sub-latent space of each input to analyze the key components and reweight their contributions in a gated manner. The intrinsic awareness is further integrated with contextualized attention in an X-shaped scheme, maximizing local-global intertwining. Extensive comparison on benchmarking all-in-one restoration setting validates our efficiency and effectiveness, i.e., our network sets new SOTA records while reducing model complexity by approximately -82% in trainable parameters and -85\% in FLOPs.

Specifically, VAEs often suffer from blurry generated samples due to the lack of a tailored training on the samples generated in the generative direction. On the other hand, EBMs can generate high-quality samples but require expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. To address these issues, we introduce a conditional EBM for calibrating the generative direction of VAE during training, without requiring it for the generation at test time. In particular, we train EC-VAE upon both the input data and the calibrated samples with adaptive weight to enhance efficacy while avoiding MCMC sampling at test time. Furthermore, we extend the calibration idea of EC-VAE to variational learning and normalizing flows, and apply EC-VAE to an additional application of zero-shot image restoration via neural transport prior and range-null theory. We evaluate the proposed method with two applications, including image generation and zero-shot image restoration, and the experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance over single-step non-adversarial generation.

Despite the notable achievement, existing methods predominantly focus on handling specific degradation types and thus require specialized models, impeding real-world applications in dynamic degradation scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Large Model Driven Image Restoration framework (LMDIR), a novel multiple-in-one image restoration paradigm that leverages the generic priors from large multi-modal language models (MMLMs) and the pretrained diffusion models. In detail, LMDIR integrates three key prior knowledges: 1) global degradation knowledge from MMLMs, 2) scene-aware contextual descriptions generated by MMLMs, and 3) fine-grained high-quality reference images synthesized by diffusion models guided by MMLM descriptions. Standing on above priors, our architecture comprises a query-based prompt encoder, degradation-aware transformer block injecting global degradation knowledge, content-aware transformer block incorporating scene description, and reference-based transformer block incorporating fine-grained image priors. This design facilitates single-stage training paradigm to address various degradations while supporting both automatic and user-guided restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our designed method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on multiple evaluation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRIDS: Grouped Multiple-Degradation Restoration with Image Degradation Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12273v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional single-task image restoration methods excel in handling specific degradation types but struggle with multiple degradations. To address this limitation, we propose Grouped Restoration with Image Degradation Similarity (GRIDS), a novel approach that harmonizes the competing objectives inherent in multiple-degradation restoration. We first introduce a quantitative method for assessing relationships between image degradations using statistical modeling of deep degradation representations. This analysis facilitates the strategic grouping of similar tasks, enhancing both the efficiency and effectiveness of the restoration process. Based on the degradation similarity, GRIDS divides restoration tasks into one of the optimal groups, where tasks within the same group are highly correlated. For instance, GRIDS effectively groups 11 degradation types into 4 cohesive groups. Trained models within each group show significant improvements, with an average improvement of 0.09dB over single-task upper bound models and 2.24dB over the mix-training baseline model. GRIDS incorporates an adaptive model selection mechanism for inference, automatically selecting the appropriate grouped-training model based on the input degradation. This mechanism is particularly useful for real-world scenarios with unknown degradations as it does not rely on explicit degradation classification modules. Furthermore, our method can predict model generalization ability without the need for network inference, providing valuable insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

An intuitive manifestation is that networks which excel in certain tasks often fail to deliver satisfactory results in others. To illustrate this point, we select five representative networks and conduct a comparative study on five classic image restoration tasks. First, we provide a detailed explanation of the characteristics of different image restoration tasks and backbone networks. Following this, we present the benchmark results and analyze the reasons behind the performance disparity of different models across various tasks. Drawing from this comparative study, we propose that a general image restoration backbone network needs to meet the functional requirements of diverse tasks.

| **[Haze-Aware Attention Network for Single-Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11505v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-image dehazing is a pivotal challenge in computer vision that seeks to remove haze from images and restore clean background details. Recognizing the limitations of traditional physical model-based methods and the inefficiencies of current attention-based solutions, we propose a new dehazing network combining an innovative Haze-Aware Attention Module (HAAM) with a Multiscale Frequency Enhancement Module (MFEM). The HAAM is inspired by the atmospheric scattering model, thus skillfully integrating physical principles into high-dimensional features for targeted dehazing. It picks up on latent features during the image restoration process, which gives a significant boost to the metrics, while the MFEM efficiently enhances high-frequency details, thus sidestepping wavelet or Fourier transform complexities. It employs multiscale fields to extract and emphasize key frequency components with minimal parameter overhead. Integrated into a simple U-Net framework, our Haze-Aware Attention Network (HAA-Net) for single-image dehazing significantly outperforms existing attention-based and transformer models in efficiency and effectiveness. Tested across various public datasets, the HAA-Net sets new performance benchmarks. Our work not only advances the field of image dehazing but also offers insights into the design of attention mechanisms for broader applications in computer vision.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[SPIRE: Semantic Prompt-Driven Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11595v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven diffusion models have become increasingly popular for various image editing tasks, including inpainting, stylization, and object replacement. However, it still remains an open research problem to adopt this language-vision paradigm for more fine-level image processing tasks, such as denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and compression artifact removal. In this paper, we develop SPIRE, a Semantic and restoration Prompt-driven Image Restoration framework that leverages natural language as a user-friendly interface to control the image restoration process. We consider the capacity of prompt information in two dimensions. First, we use content-related prompts to enhance the semantic alignment, effectively alleviating identity ambiguity in the restoration outcomes. Second, our approach is the first framework that supports fine-level instruction through language-based quantitative specification of the restoration strength, without the need for explicit task-specific design. In addition, we introduce a novel fusion mechanism that augments the existing ControlNet architecture by learning to rescale the generative prior, thereby achieving better restoration fidelity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior restoration performance of SPIRE compared to the state of the arts, alongside offering the flexibility of text-based control over the restoration effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024; Webpage: https://chenyangqiqi.github.io/tip</p></details> |
| **[In-Loop Filtering via Trained Look-Up Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10926v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology for removing the artifacts in image/video coding standards. Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

This intends to handle two pivotal challenges in the existing CIR methods: (i) lacking adaptability and universality for different image codecs, e.g., JPEG and WebP; (ii) poor texture generation capability, particularly at low bitrates. Specifically, our MoE-DiffIR develops the powerful mixture-of-experts (MoE) prompt module, where some basic prompts cooperate to excavate the task-customized diffusion priors from Stable Diffusion (SD) for each compression task. Moreover, the degradation-aware routing mechanism is proposed to enable the flexible assignment of basic prompts. To activate and reuse the cross-modality generation prior of SD, we design the visual-to-text adapter for MoE-DiffIR, which aims to adapt the embedding of low-quality images from the visual domain to the textual domain as the textual guidance for SD, enabling more consistent and reasonable texture generation. We also construct one comprehensive benchmark dataset for universal CIR, covering 21 types of degradations from 7 popular traditional and learned codecs. Extensive experiments on universal CIR have demonstrated the excellent robustness and texture restoration capability of our proposed MoE-DiffIR.

Among them, the blind spot network based methods are the most typical type and have attracted the attentions of a large number of researchers. Although the introduction of blind spot operations can prevent identity mapping from noise to noise, it imposes stringent requirements on the receptive fields in the network design, thereby limiting overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a single mask scheme for self-supervised denoising training, which eliminates the need for blind spot operation and thereby removes constraints on the network structure design. Furthermore, to achieve denoising across entire image during inference, we propose a multi-mask scheme. Our method, featuring the asymmetric mask scheme in training and inference, achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing real noisy image datasets. All the source code will be made available to the public.</p></details> |  |

Common models involve several stages of data resampling, in which the resolution of feature maps is first reduced to aggregate information and then increased to generate a high-resolution output. Previous works have shown that resampling operations are subject to artifacts such as aliasing. During downsampling, aliases have been shown to compromise the prediction stability of image classifiers. During upsampling, they have been leveraged to detect generated content. Yet, the effect of aliases during upsampling has not yet been discussed w.r.t. the stability and robustness of pixel-wise predictions. While falling under the same term (aliasing), the challenges for correct upsampling in neural networks differ significantly from those during downsampling: when downsampling, some high frequencies can not be correctly represented and have to be removed to avoid aliases. However, when upsampling for pixel-wise predictions, we actually require the model to restore such high frequencies that can not be encoded in lower resolutions. The application of findings from signal processing is therefore a necessary but not a sufficient condition to achieve the desirable output. In contrast, we find that the availability of large spatial context during upsampling allows to provide stable, high-quality pixel-wise predictions, even when fully learning all filter weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Motion-Guided Latent Diffusion for Temporally Consistent Real-world Video Super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00853v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world low-resolution (LR) videos have diverse and complex degradations, imposing great challenges on video super-resolution (VSR) algorithms to reproduce their high-resolution (HR) counterparts with high quality. Recently, the diffusion models have shown compelling performance in generating realistic details for image restoration tasks. However, the diffusion process has randomness, making it hard to control the contents of restored images. This issue becomes more serious when applying diffusion models to VSR tasks because temporal consistency is crucial to the perceptual quality of videos. In this paper, we propose an effective real-world VSR algorithm by leveraging the strength of pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure the content consistency among adjacent frames, we exploit the temporal dynamics in LR videos to guide the diffusion process by optimizing the latent sampling path with a motion-guided loss, ensuring that the generated HR video maintains a coherent and continuous visual flow. To further mitigate the discontinuity of generated details, we insert temporal module to the decoder and fine-tune it with an innovative sequence-oriented loss. The proposed motion-guided latent diffusion (MGLD) based VSR algorithm achieves significantly better perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Region Attention Transformer for Medical Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09268v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in medical image restoration, attributed to the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism in the spatial dimension. However, the majority of existing Transformers conduct attention within fixed and coarsely partitioned regions (\text{e.g.} the entire image or fixed patches), resulting in interference from irrelevant regions and fragmentation of continuous image content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Region Attention Transformer (RAT) that utilizes a region-based multi-head self-attention mechanism (R-MSA). The R-MSA dynamically partitions the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions using the robust Segment Anything Model (SAM) and then performs self-attention within these regions. This region partitioning is more flexible and interpretable, ensuring that only pixels from similar semantic regions complement each other, thereby eliminating interference from irrelevant regions. Moreover, we introduce a focal region loss to guide our model to adaptively focus on recovering high-difficulty regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RAT in various medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, and pathological image super-resolution.

Extending a powerful meta-learning framework, MetaWeather formulates the task of weather-degraded image restoration as a few-shot adaptation problem that predicts the degradation pattern of a query image, and learns to adapt to unseen weather conditions through a novel spatial-channel matching algorithm. Experimental results on the BID Task II.A, SPA-Data, and RealSnow datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can adapt to unseen weather conditions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-weather image restoration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

Many existing methods primarily focus on the spatial domain, neglecting the understanding of frequency variations and ignoring the impact of implicit noise in skip connections. In this paper, we introduce a multi-scale frequency selection network (MSFSNet) that seamlessly integrates spatial and frequency domain knowledge, selectively recovering richer and more accurate information. Specifically, we initially capture spatial features and input them into dynamic filter selection modules (DFS) at different scales to integrate frequency knowledge. DFS utilizes learnable filters to generate high and low-frequency information and employs a frequency cross-attention mechanism (FCAM) to determine the most information to recover. To learn a multi-scale and accurate set of hybrid features, we develop a skip feature fusion block (SFF) that leverages contextual features to discriminatively determine which information should be propagated in skip-connections. It is worth noting that our DFS and SFF are generic plug-in modules that can be directly employed in existing networks without any adjustments, leading to performance improvements. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that our MSFSNet achieves performance that is either superior or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.20106</p></details> |

Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking. In this paper, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from technical details to applications. We highlight the major advancements in deep learning-based single-image shadow removal methods, thoroughly review previous research across various categories, and provide insights into the historical progression of these developments. Additionally, we summarize performance comparisons both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond the technical aspects of shadow removal methods, we also explore potential future directions for this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>url: ...</summary><p>url: https://github.com/GuoLanqing/Awesome-Shadow-Removal</p></details> |

To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, based on our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method, known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants.

Nevertheless, this solution poses several key challenges: i) increasing the carrier frequency and bandwidth leads to greater channel frequency selectivity in time and frequency domains, and ii) the greater the number of antennas the greater the the pilot overhead for channel estimation and the more prohibitively complex it becomes to determine the optimal precoding matrix. This paper presents two deep-learning frameworks to solve these issues. Firstly, we propose a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that is based on image super-resolution and captures the correlations between the transmitting and receiving antennas and the frequency domains to combat frequency selectivity. Secondly, we devise a deep learning-based framework to combat the time selectivity of the channel that treats channel aging as a distortion that can be mitigated through deep learning-based image restoration techniques. Simulation results show that combining both frameworks leads to a significant improvement in performance compared to existing techniques with little increase in complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In particular, the pre-trained text-to-image stable diffusion models provide a potential solution to the challenging realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) and image stylization problems with their strong generative priors. However, the existing methods along this line often fail to keep faithful pixel-wise image structures. If extra skip connections between the encoder and the decoder of a VAE are used to reproduce details, additional training in image space will be required, limiting the application to tasks in latent space such as image stylization. In this work, we propose a pixel-aware stable diffusion (PASD) network to achieve robust Real-ISR and personalized image stylization. Specifically, a pixel-aware cross attention module is introduced to enable diffusion models perceiving image local structures in pixel-wise level, while a degradation removal module is used to extract degradation insensitive features to guide the diffusion process together with image high level information. An adjustable noise schedule is introduced to further improve the image restoration results. By simply replacing the base diffusion model with a stylized one, PASD can generate diverse stylized images without collecting pairwise training data, and by shifting the base model with an aesthetic one, PASD can bring old photos back to life. Extensive experiments in a variety of image enhancement and stylization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PASD approach.

In this research, we introduce a multi-scale generative model that enhances conditional image restoration through a novel exploitation of the Brownian Bridge process within wavelet domain. By initiating the Brownian Bridge diffusion process specifically at the lowest-frequency subband and applying generative adversarial networks at subsequent multi-scale high-frequency subbands in the wavelet domain, our method provides significant acceleration during training and sampling while sustaining a high image generation quality and diversity on par with SOTA diffusion models. Experimental results on various computational microscopy and imaging tasks confirm our method's robust performance and its considerable reduction in its sampling steps and time. This pioneering technique offers an efficient image restoration framework that harmonizes efficiency with quality, signifying a major stride in incorporating cutting-edge generative models into computational microscopy workflows.</p></details> |  |

Adversarial attacks such as the seminal projected gradient descent (PGD) offer an effective means to evaluate a model's robustness and dedicated solutions have been proposed for attacks on semantic segmentation or optical flow estimation. While they attempt to increase the attack's efficiency, a further objective is to balance its effect, so that it acts on the entire image domain instead of isolated point-wise predictions. This often comes at the cost of optimization stability and thus efficiency. Here, we propose CosPGD, an attack that encourages more balanced errors over the entire image domain while increasing the attack's overall efficiency. To this end, CosPGD leverages a simple alignment score computed from any pixel-wise prediction and its target to scale the loss in a smooth and fully differentiable way. It leads to efficient evaluations of a model's robustness for semantic segmentation as well as regression models (such as optical flow, disparity estimation, or image restoration), and it allows it to outperform the previous SotA attack on semantic segmentation.

Moreover, existing methods often suffer from over-smoothing and lack of realism in the restored results. To address these issues, we propose Diff-Restorer, a universal image restoration method based on the diffusion model, aiming to leverage the prior knowledge of Stable Diffusion to remove degradation while generating high perceptual quality restoration results. Specifically, we utilize the pre-trained visual language model to extract visual prompts from degraded images, including semantic and degradation embeddings. The semantic embeddings serve as content prompts to guide the diffusion model for generation. In contrast, the degradation embeddings modulate the Image-guided Control Module to generate spatial priors for controlling the spatial structure of the diffusion process, ensuring faithfulness to the original image. Additionally, we design a Degradation-aware Decoder to perform structural correction and convert the latent code to the pixel domain. We conducted comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis on restoration tasks with different degradations, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of the generated images is still a significant challenge due to the severity of image degradation and the uncontrollability of the diffusion model. In this work, we delve into the potential of utilizing pre-trained stable diffusion for image restoration and propose MRIR, a diffusion-based restoration method with multimodal insights. Specifically, we explore the problem from two perspectives: textual level and visual level. For the textual level, we harness the power of the pre-trained multimodal large language model to infer meaningful semantic information from low-quality images. Furthermore, we employ the CLIP image encoder with a designed Refine Layer to capture image details as a supplement. For the visual level, we mainly focus on the pixel level control. Thus, we utilize a Pixel-level Processor and ControlNet to control spatial structures. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned control information into the denoising U-Net using multi-level attention mechanisms and realize controllable image restoration with multimodal insights. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate our method's superiority over other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on a pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the self-attention layer with the proposed cross-previous-frame attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between neighboring frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy for better temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in producing temporally consistent videos with better fidelity.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Improving Diffusion Inverse Problem Solving with Decoupled Noise Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01521v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems. For example, we achieve a PSNR of 30.72dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for phase retrieval, which is an improvement of 9.12dB compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Inversion using Latent Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01027v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for solving inverse problems due to their exceptional ability to model complex prior distributions. However, existing methods predominantly assume known forward operators (i.e., non-blind), limiting their applicability in practical settings where acquiring such operators is costly. Additionally, many current approaches rely on pixel-space diffusion models, leaving the potential of more powerful latent diffusion models (LDMs) underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LatentDEM, an innovative technique that addresses more challenging blind inverse problems using latent diffusion priors. At the core of our method is solving blind inverse problems within an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework: (1) the E-step recovers clean images from corrupted observations using LDM priors and a known forward model, and (2) the M-step estimates the forward operator based on the recovered images. Additionally, we propose two novel optimization techniques tailored for LDM priors and EM frameworks, yielding more accurate and efficient blind inversion results. As a general framework, LatentDEM supports both linear and non-linear inverse problems. Beyond common 2D image restoration tasks, it enables new capabilities in non-linear 3D inverse rendering problems. We validate LatentDEM's performance on representative 2D blind deblurring and 3D sparse-view reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its superior efficacy over prior arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Frequency-Aware Dynamic Transformers for All-In-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01636v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to tackle the all-in-one image restoration task, which seeks to handle multiple types of degradation with a single model. The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Recognizing that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new all-in-one image restoration approach from a frequency perspective, leveraging advanced vision transformers. Our method consists of two main components: a frequency-aware Degradation prior learning transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing inputs into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods on four representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing and deblurring. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling spatially variant degradations and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Instruct-IPT: All-in-One Image Processing Transformer via Weight Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00676v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the unaffordable size and intensive computation costs of low-level vision models, All-in-One models that are designed to address a handful of low-level vision tasks simultaneously have been popular. However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. Rather than popular feature adaptation methods, we propose weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we figure out task-sensitive weights via a toy experiment and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. Further, we propose to maneuver Instruct-IPT with text instructions for better user interfaces. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well. The code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-IPT.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we focus on the task of all-in-one medical image restoration, aiming to address multiple distinct MedIR tasks with a single universal model. Nonetheless, due to significant differences between different MedIR tasks, training a universal model often encounters task interference issues, where different tasks with shared parameters may conflict with each other in the gradient update direction. This task interference leads to deviation of the model update direction from the optimal path, thereby affecting the model's performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a task-adaptive routing strategy, allowing conflicting tasks to select different network paths in spatial and channel dimensions, thereby mitigating task interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed \textbf{A}ll-in-one \textbf{M}edical \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration (\textbf{AMIR}) network achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis, both in single-task and all-in-one settings.

| **[Denoising as Adaptation: Noise-Space Domain Adaptation for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18516v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although deep learning-based image restoration methods have made significant progress, they still struggle with limited generalization to real-world scenarios due to the substantial domain gap caused by training on synthetic data. Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise-space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how the multi-step denoising process is influenced by auxiliary conditional inputs, we obtain meaningful gradients from noise prediction to gradually align the restored results of both synthetic and real-world data to a common clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during training, we present useful techniques such as channel shuffling and residual-swapping contrastive learning. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The joint training process of IRConStyle, an Image Restoration framework consisting of ConStyle and a general restoration network, is divided into two stages: first, pre-training ConStyle alone, and then freezing its weights to guide the training of the general restoration network. Three improvements are proposed in the pre-training stage to train ConStyle: unsupervised pre-training, adding a pretext task (i.e. classification), and adopting knowledge distillation. Without bells and whistles, we can get ConStyle v2, a strong prompter for all-in-one Image Restoration, in less than two GPU days and doesn't require any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on Restormer (transformer-based), NAFNet (CNN-based), MAXIM-1S (MLP-based), and a vanilla CNN network demonstrate that ConStyle v2 can enhance any U-Net style Image Restoration models to all-in-one Image Restoration models. Furthermore, models guided by the well-trained ConStyle v2 exhibit superior performance in some specific degradation compared to ConStyle.</p></details> |  |
| **[MFDNet: Multi-Frequency Deflare Network for Efficient Nighttime Flare Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18079v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When light is scattered or reflected accidentally in the lens, flare artifacts may appear in the captured photos, affecting the photos' visual quality. The main challenge in flare removal is to eliminate various flare artifacts while preserving the original content of the image. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight Multi-Frequency Deflare Network (MFDNet) based on the Laplacian Pyramid. Our network decomposes the flare-corrupted image into low and high-frequency bands, effectively separating the illumination and content information in the image. The low-frequency part typically contains illumination information, while the high-frequency part contains detailed content information. So our MFDNet consists of two main modules: the Low-Frequency Flare Perception Module (LFFPM) to remove flare in the low-frequency part and the Hierarchical Fusion Reconstruction Module (HFRM) to reconstruct the flare-free image. Specifically, to perceive flare from a global perspective while retaining detailed information for image restoration, LFFPM utilizes Transformer to extract global information while utilizing a convolutional neural network to capture detailed local features. Then HFRM gradually fuses the outputs of LFFPM with the high-frequency component of the image through feature aggregation. Moreover, our MFDNet can reduce the computational cost by processing in multiple frequency bands instead of directly removing the flare on the input image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in removing nighttime flare on real-world and synthetic images from the Flare7K dataset. Furthermore, the computational complexity of our model is remarkably low.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Visual Computer journal</p></details> |
| **[Graph Image Prior for Unsupervised Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15770v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can be a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> |  |
| **[DaLPSR: Leverage Degradation-Aligned Language Prompt for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16477v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level, especially in real-world cases based on reference-free metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIR: A Lightweight Baseline for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01368v3)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been significant advancements in Image Restoration based on CNN and transformer. However, the inherent characteristics of the Image Restoration task are often overlooked in many works. They, instead, tend to focus on the basic block design and stack numerous such blocks to the model, leading to parameters redundant and computations unnecessary. Thus, the efficiency of the image restoration is hindered. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Baseline network for Image Restoration called LIR to efficiently restore the image and remove degradations. First of all, through an ingenious structural design, LIR removes the degradations existing in the local and global residual connections that are ignored by modern networks. Then, a Lightweight Adaptive Attention (LAA) Block is introduced which is mainly composed of proposed Adaptive Filters and Attention Blocks. The proposed Adaptive Filter is used to adaptively extract high-frequency information and enhance object contours in various IR tasks, and Attention Block involves a novel Patch Attention module to approximate the self-attention part of the transformer. On the deraining task, our LIR achieves the state-of-the-art Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). For denoising, dehazing, and deblurring tasks, LIR also achieves a comparable performance to state-of-the-art models with a parameter size of about 30\%. In addition, it is worth noting that our LIR produces better visual results that are more in line with the human aesthetic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultra-High-Definition Restoration: New Benchmarks and A Dual Interaction Prior-Driven Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13607v2)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration has acquired remarkable attention due to its practical demand. In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, UHD image desonwing, and UHD image deraining.

| **[Image Restoration Using Deep Regulated Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08853v2)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the depth of convolutional neural networks has attracted substantial attention in the deep learning research, the width of these networks has recently received greater interest. The width of networks, defined as the size of the receptive fields and the density of the channels, has demonstrated crucial importance in low-level vision tasks such as image denoising and restoration. However, the limited generalization ability, due to the increased width of networks, creates a bottleneck in designing wider networks. In this paper, we propose the Deep Regulated Convolutional Network (RC-Net), a deep network composed of regulated sub-network blocks cascaded by skip-connections, to overcome this bottleneck. Specifically, the Regulated Convolution block (RC-block), featured by a combination of large and small convolution filters, balances the effectiveness of prominent feature extraction and the generalization ability of the network. RC-Nets have several compelling advantages: they embrace diversified features through large-small filter combinations, alleviate the hazy boundary and blurred details in image denoising and super-resolution problems, and stabilize the learning process. Our proposed RC-Nets outperform state-of-the-art approaches with significant performance gains in various image restoration tasks while demonstrating promising generalization ability.

However, these methods often struggle with overfitting and lack interpretability. In this paper, we explore an alternative clustering approach based on deep unfolding. By unfolding iterative optimization methods into neural networks, this approach offers enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to data-driven deep learning methods, and greater adaptability and generalization than model-based approaches. Hence, unfolding has become widely used in inverse imaging problems, such as image restoration, reconstruction, and super-resolution, but has not been sufficiently explored yet in the context of clustering. In this work, we introduce an innovative clustering architecture for hyperspectral images (HSI) by unfolding an iterative solver based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for sparse subspace clustering. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply unfolding ADMM for computing the self-representation matrix in subspace clustering. Moreover, our approach captures well the structural characteristics of HSI data by employing the K nearest neighbors algorithm as part of a structure preservation module. Experimental evaluation of three established HSI datasets shows clearly the potential of the unfolding approach in HSI clustering and even demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based framework called GridFormer which serves as a backbone for image restoration under adverse weather conditions. GridFormer is designed in a grid structure using a residual dense transformer block, and it introduces two core designs. First, it uses an enhanced attention mechanism in the transformer layer. The mechanism includes stages of the sampler and compact self-attention to improve efficiency, and a local enhancement stage to strengthen local information. Second, we introduce a residual dense transformer block (RDTB) as the final GridFormer layer. This design further improves the network's ability to learn effective features from both preceding and current local features. The GridFormer framework achieves state-of-the-art results on five diverse image restoration tasks in adverse weather conditions, including image deraining, dehazing, deraining \& dehazing, desnowing, and multi-weather restoration.

| **[Diffusion Model-based FOD Restoration from High Distortion in dMRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13209v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fiber orientation distributions (FODs) is a popular model to represent the diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. However, imaging artifacts such as susceptibility-induced distortion in dMRI can cause signal loss and lead to the corrupted reconstruction of FODs, which prohibits successful fiber tracking and connectivity analysis in affected brain regions such as the brain stem. Generative models, such as the diffusion models, have been successfully applied in various image restoration tasks. However, their application on FOD images poses unique challenges since FODs are 4-dimensional data represented by spherical harmonics (SPHARM) with the 4-th dimension exhibiting order-related dependency. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model for FOD restoration that can recover the signal loss caused by distortion artifacts. We use volume-order encoding to enhance the ability of the diffusion model to generate individual FOD volumes at all SPHARM orders. Moreover, we add cross-attention features extracted across all SPHARM orders in generating every individual FOD volume to capture the order-related dependency across FOD volumes. We also condition the diffusion model with low-distortion FODs surrounding high-distortion areas to maintain the geometric coherence of the generated FODs. We trained and tested our model using data from the UK Biobank (n = 1315). On a test set with ground truth (n = 43), we demonstrate the high accuracy of the generated FODs in terms of root mean square errors of FOD volumes and angular errors of FOD peaks. We also apply our method to a test set with large distortion in the brain stem area (n = 1172) and demonstrate the efficacy of our method in restoring the FOD integrity and, hence, greatly improving tractography performance in affected brain regions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Restorer: Solving Multiple Image Restoration Tasks with One Set of Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12587v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although there are many excellent solutions in image restoration, the fact that they are specifically designed for a single image restoration task may prevent them from being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in other types of image restoration tasks. While some approaches require considering multiple image restoration tasks, they are still not sufficient for the requirements of the real world and may suffer from the task confusion issue. In this work, we focus on designing a unified and effective solution for multiple image restoration tasks including deraining, desnowing, defogging, deblurring, denoising, and low-light enhancement. Based on the above purpose, we propose a Transformer network Restorer with U-Net architecture. In order to effectively deal with degraded information in multiple image restoration tasks, we need a more comprehensive attention mechanism. Thus, we design all-axis attention (AAA) through stereo embedding and 3D convolution, which can simultaneously model the long-range dependencies in both spatial and channel dimensions, capturing potential correlations among all axis. Moreover, we propose a Restorer based on textual prompts. Compared to previous methods that employ learnable queries, textual prompts bring explicit task priors to solve the task confusion issue arising from learnable queries and introduce interactivity. Based on these designs, Restorer demonstrates SOTA or comparable performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to universal image restoration frameworks and methods specifically designed for these individual tasks. Meanwhile, Restorer is faster during inference. The above results along with the real-world test results show that Restorer has the potential to serve as a backbone for multiple real-world image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real- ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real- ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source codes will be released at https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel transformer-based method for GFIQA, which is aided by two unique mechanisms. First, a Dual-Set Degradation Representation Learning (DSL) mechanism uses facial images with both synthetic and real degradations to decouple degradation from content, ensuring generalizability to real-world scenarios. This self-supervised method learns degradation features on a global scale, providing a robust alternative to conventional methods that use local patch information in degradation learning. Second, our transformer leverages facial landmarks to emphasize visually salient parts of a face image in evaluating its perceptual quality. We also introduce a balanced and diverse Comprehensive Generic Face IQA (CGFIQA-40k) dataset of 40K images carefully designed to overcome the biases, in particular the imbalances in skin tone and gender representation, in existing datasets. Extensive analysis and evaluation demonstrate the robustness of our method, marking a significant improvement over prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024, Project Page: https://dsl-fiqa.github.io/</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a Meta-learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based SISR approach to learn kernel priors from organized randomness. In concrete, a lightweight network is adopted as kernel generator, and is optimized via learning from the MCMC simulation on random Gaussian distributions. This procedure provides an approximation for the rational blur kernel, and introduces a network-level Langevin dynamics into SISR optimization processes, which contributes to preventing bad local optimal solutions for kernel estimation. Meanwhile, a meta-learning-based alternating optimization procedure is proposed to optimize the kernel generator and image restorer, respectively. In contrast to the conventional alternating minimization strategy, a meta-learning-based framework is applied to learn an adaptive optimization strategy, which is less-greedy and results in better convergence performance. These two procedures are iteratively processed in a plug-and-play fashion, for the first time, realizing a learning-based but plug-and-play blind SISR solution in unsupervised inference. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance and generalization ability of the proposed approach when comparing with state-of-the-arts on synthesis and real-world datasets.

This hierarchical DIR framework dynamically adjusts to the characteristics of the input document, facilitating effective domain adaptation. We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively using a new real-world dataset, LayeredDocDB, developed for this study.

The integration of sinogram and image enhancement modules aims to enhance image clarity and preserve fine details, offering a promising solution for both low dose and clinical dose CBCT reconstruction. The averaged mean squared error (MSE) over the validation dataset has decreased significantly, in the case of low dose by one-fifth and clinical dose by one-tenth. Our solution is one of the top 5 approaches in this challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[DemosaicFormer: Coarse-to-Fine Demosaicing Network for HybridEVS Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07951v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid Event-Based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) is a novel sensor integrating traditional frame-based and event-based sensors, offering substantial benefits for applications requiring low-light, high dynamic range, and low-latency environments, such as smartphones and wearable devices. Despite its potential, the lack of Image signal processing (ISP) pipeline specifically designed for HybridEVS poses a significant challenge. To address this challenge, in this study, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework named DemosaicFormer which comprises coarse demosaicing and pixel correction. Coarse demosaicing network is designed to produce a preliminary high-quality estimate of the RGB image from the HybridEVS raw data while the pixel correction network enhances the performance of image restoration and mitigates the impact of defective pixels. Our key innovation is the design of a Multi-Scale Gating Module (MSGM) applying the integration of cross-scale features, which allows feature information to flow between different scales. Additionally, the adoption of progressive training and data augmentation strategies further improves model's robustness and effectiveness. Experimental results show superior performance against the existing methods both qualitatively and visually, and our DemosaicFormer achieves the best performance in terms of all the evaluation metrics in the MIPI 2024 challenge on Demosaic for Hybridevs Camera.

| **[Beware of Aliases -- Signal Preservation is Crucial for Robust Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07435v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration networks are usually comprised of an encoder and a decoder, responsible for aggregating image content from noisy, distorted data and to restore clean, undistorted images, respectively. Data aggregation as well as high-resolution image generation both usually come at the risk of involving aliases, i.e.~standard architectures put their ability to reconstruct the model input in jeopardy to reach high PSNR values on validation data. The price to be paid is low model robustness. In this work, we show that simply providing alias-free paths in state-of-the-art reconstruction transformers supports improved model robustness at low costs on the restoration performance. We do so by proposing BOA-Restormer, a transformer-based image restoration model that executes downsampling and upsampling operations partly in the frequency domain to ensure alias-free paths along the entire model while potentially preserving all relevant high-frequency information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tags:...</summary><p>Tags: Adversarial attack, image restoration, image deblurring, frequency sampling</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Denoising Capability of Diffusion Prior for Solving Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06959v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent emergence of diffusion models has significantly advanced the precision of learnable priors, presenting innovative avenues for addressing inverse problems. Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

| **[The Perception-Robustness Tradeoff in Deterministic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09253v4)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the behavior of deterministic methods for solving inverse problems in imaging. These methods are commonly designed to achieve two goals: (1) attaining high perceptual quality, and (2) generating reconstructions that are consistent with the measurements. We provide a rigorous proof that the better a predictor satisfies these two requirements, the larger its Lipschitz constant must be, regardless of the nature of the degradation involved. In particular, to approach perfect perceptual quality and perfect consistency, the Lipschitz constant of the model must grow to infinity. This implies that such methods are necessarily more susceptible to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our theory on single image super-resolution algorithms, addressing both noisy and noiseless settings. We also show how this undesired behavior can be leveraged to explore the posterior distribution, thereby allowing the deterministic model to imitate stochastic methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Eye Surgeon: Finding Image Priors through Sparse Generators at Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05288v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Optimal Eye Surgeon (OES), a framework for pruning and training deep image generator networks. Typically, untrained deep convolutional networks, which include image sampling operations, serve as effective image priors (Ulyanov et al., 2018). However, they tend to overfit to noise in image restoration tasks due to being overparameterized. OES addresses this by adaptively pruning networks at random initialization to a level of underparameterization. This process effectively captures low-frequency image components even without training, by just masking. When trained to fit noisy images, these pruned subnetworks, which we term Sparse-DIP, resist overfitting to noise. This benefit arises from underparameterization and the regularization effect of masking, constraining them in the manifold of image priors. We demonstrate that subnetworks pruned through OES surpass other leading pruning methods, such as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which is known to be suboptimal for image recovery tasks (Wu et al., 2023). Our extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of OES-masks and the characteristics of sparse-subnetworks for image generation.

However, they require large amounts of computational power for training and inference. In this paper, we propose lightweight diffusion models for image inpainting that can be trained on a single image, or a few images. We show that our approach competes with large state-of-the-art models in specific cases. We also show that training a model on a single image is particularly relevant for image acquisition modality that differ from the RGB images of standard learning databases. We show results in three different contexts: texture images, line drawing images, and materials BRDF, for which we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of realism, with a computational load that is greatly reduced compared to concurrent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

This work study this challenging problem and reveal its essence as unidentified distribution shifts between the test and training data. Recently, test-time adaptation has emerged as a fundamental method to address this inherent disparities. Inspired by it, we propose a test-time degradation adaptation framework for open-set image restoration, which consists of three components, \textit{i.e.}, i) a pre-trained and degradation-agnostic diffusion model for generating clean images, ii) a test-time degradation adapter adapts the unknown degradations based on the input image during the testing phase, and iii) the adapter-guided image restoration guides the model through the adapter to produce the corresponding clean image. Through experiments on multiple degradations, we show that our method achieves comparable even better performance than those task-specific methods.

We first propose an extrapolated DYS method to effectively solve a class of structural nonconvex optimization problems that involve minimizing the sum of three possible nonconvex functions. Our approach provides an algorithmic framework that encompasses both extrapolated forward-backward splitting and extrapolated Douglas-Rachford splitting methods. To establish the convergence of the proposed method, we rigorously analyze its behavior based on the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property, subject to some tight parameter conditions. Moreover, we introduce two extrapolated PnP-DYS methods with convergence guarantee, where the traditional regularization prior is replaced by a gradient step-based denoiser. This denoiser is designed using a differentiable neural network and can be reformulated as the proximal operator of a specific nonconvex functional. We conduct extensive experiments on image deblurring and image super-resolution problems, where our results showcase the advantage of the extrapolation strategy and the superior performance of the learning-based model that incorporates the PnP denoiser in terms of achieving high-quality recovery images.</p></details> | 37 Pages |

In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 6 tables |
| **[Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application. In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms. Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlation Matching Transformation Transformers for UHD Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00629v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes UHDformer, a general Transformer for Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration. UHDformer contains two learning spaces: (a) learning in high-resolution space and (b) learning in low-resolution space. The former learns multi-level high-resolution features and fuses low-high features and reconstructs the residual images, while the latter explores more representative features learning from the high-resolution ones to facilitate better restoration. To better improve feature representation in low-resolution space, we propose to build feature transformation from the high-resolution space to the low-resolution one. To that end, we propose two new modules: Dual-path Correlation Matching Transformation module (DualCMT) and Adaptive Channel Modulator (ACM). The DualCMT selects top C/r (r is greater or equal to 1 which controls the squeezing level) correlation channels from the max-pooling/mean-pooling high-resolution features to replace low-resolution ones in Transformers, which can effectively squeeze useless content to improve the feature representation in low-resolution space to facilitate better recovery. The ACM is exploited to adaptively modulate multi-level high-resolution features, enabling to provide more useful features to low-resolution space for better learning. Experimental results show that our UHDformer reduces about ninety-seven percent model sizes compared with most state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving performance under different training sets on 3 UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the efficacy of learning large models capable of addressing various degradations simultaneously. Nonetheless, these approaches introduce considerable computational overhead and complex learning paradigms, limiting their practical utility. In response, we propose \textit{DaAIR}, an efficient All-in-One image restorer employing a Degradation-aware Learner (DaLe) in the low-rank regime to collaboratively mine shared aspects and subtle nuances across diverse degradations, generating a degradation-aware embedding. By dynamically allocating model capacity to input degradations, we realize an efficient restorer integrating holistic and specific learning within a unified model. Furthermore, DaAIR introduces a cost-efficient parameter update mechanism that enhances degradation awareness while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive comparisons across five image degradations demonstrate that our DaAIR outperforms both state-of-the-art All-in-One models and degradation-specific counterparts, affirming our efficacy and practicality.

| **[Restoration by Generation with Constrained Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17161v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent generative power of denoising diffusion models makes them well-suited for image restoration tasks where the objective is to find the optimal high-quality image within the generative space that closely resembles the input image. We propose a method to adapt a pretrained diffusion model for image restoration by simply adding noise to the input image to be restored and then denoise. Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space, we can then leverage the sampling strategy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration, where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space. This approach allows us to produce results that accurately preserve high-frequency details, which previous works are unable to do.

| **[MeshFormer: High-Quality Mesh Generation with 3D-Guided Reconstruction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10198v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-world 3D reconstruction models have recently garnered significant attention. However, without sufficient 3D inductive bias, existing methods typically entail expensive training costs and struggle to extract high-quality 3D meshes. In this work, we introduce MeshFormer, a sparse-view reconstruction model that explicitly leverages 3D native structure, input guidance, and training supervision. Specifically, instead of using a triplane representation, we store features in 3D sparse voxels and combine transformers with 3D convolutions to leverage an explicit 3D structure and projective bias. In addition to sparse-view RGB input, we require the network to take input and generate corresponding normal maps. The input normal maps can be predicted by 2D diffusion models, significantly aiding in the guidance and refinement of the geometry's learning. Moreover, by combining Signed Distance Function (SDF) supervision with surface rendering, we directly learn to generate high-quality meshes without the need for complex multi-stage training processes. By incorporating these explicit 3D biases, MeshFormer can be trained efficiently and deliver high-quality textured meshes with fine-grained geometric details. It can also be integrated with 2D diffusion models to enable fast single-image-to-3D and text-to-3D tasks. Project page: https://meshformer3d.github.io</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[SpaRP: Fast 3D Object Reconstruction and Pose Estimation from Sparse Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10195v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-world 3D generation has recently attracted considerable attention. While many single-image-to-3D methods have yielded visually appealing outcomes, they often lack sufficient controllability and tend to produce hallucinated regions that may not align with users' expectations. In this paper, we explore an important scenario in which the input consists of one or a few unposed 2D images of a single object, with little or no overlap. We propose a novel method, SpaRP, to reconstruct a 3D textured mesh and estimate the relative camera poses for these sparse-view images. SpaRP distills knowledge from 2D diffusion models and finetunes them to implicitly deduce the 3D spatial relationships between the sparse views. The diffusion model is trained to jointly predict surrogate representations for camera poses and multi-view images of the object under known poses, integrating all information from the input sparse views. These predictions are then leveraged to accomplish 3D reconstruction and pose estimation, and the reconstructed 3D model can be used to further refine the camera poses of input views. Through extensive experiments on three datasets, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of 3D reconstruction quality and pose prediction accuracy but also exhibits strong efficiency. It requires only about 20 seconds to produce a textured mesh and camera poses for the input views. Project page: https://chaoxu.xyz/sparp.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

However, privileged information is rarely available in practice. To this end, we propose a text classification framework that harnesses text-to-image diffusion models to generate artificial privileged information. The generated images and the original text samples are further used to train multimodal teacher models based on state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures. Finally, the knowledge from multimodal teachers is distilled into a text-based (unimodal) student. Hence, by employing a generative model to produce synthetic data as privileged information, we guide the training of the student model. Our framework, called Learning Using Generated Privileged Information (LUGPI), yields noticeable performance gains on four text classification data sets, demonstrating its potential in text classification without any additional cost during inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

A vital issue that must be addressed is the generation of energy from non-renewable and often polluted sources. For this reason, the development of renewable energy sources is of great importance. Unfortunately, too rapid spread of renewables can disrupt stability of the power system and lead to energy blackouts. One should not simply support it, without ensuring sustainability and understanding of the diffusion process. In this research, we propose a new agent-based model of diffusion of photovoltaic panels.

In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus.

This development, while impressive, also raises significant privacy and security concerns. In response to this, we propose a novel Latent REconstruction error guided feature REfinement method (LaRE^2) for detecting the diffusion-generated images. We come up with the Latent Reconstruction Error (LaRE), the first reconstruction-error based feature in the latent space for generated image detection. LaRE surpasses existing methods in terms of feature extraction efficiency while preserving crucial cues required to differentiate between the real and the fake. To exploit LaRE, we propose an Error-Guided feature REfinement module (EGRE), which can refine the image feature guided by LaRE to enhance the discriminativeness of the feature. Our EGRE utilizes an align-then-refine mechanism, which effectively refines the image feature for generated-image detection from both spatial and channel perspectives. Extensive experiments on the large-scale GenImage benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our LaRE^2, which surpasses the best SoTA method by up to 11.9%/12.1% average ACC/AP across 8 different image generators. LaRE also surpasses existing methods in terms of feature extraction cost, delivering an impressive speed enhancement of 8 times.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

Training machine learning models for these systems requires a large corpus of annotated datasets, which is challenging to obtain in the surgical domain due to patient privacy concerns and the significant labeling effort required from doctors. Previous methods have explored unpaired image translation using generative models to create realistic surgical images from simulations. However, these approaches have struggled to produce high-quality, diverse surgical images. In this work, we introduce \emph{SurgicaL-CD}, a consistency-distilled diffusion method to generate realistic surgical images with only a few sampling steps without paired data.

The scarcity of publicly available datasets with comprehensive annotations for intricate table structures hinders the development and evaluation of models designed for such scenarios. This research paper introduces a novel approach for generating annotated images for table structure by leveraging conditioned mask images of rows and columns through the application of latent diffusion models. The proposed method aims to enhance the quality of synthetic data used for training object detection models. Specifically, the study employs a conditioning mechanism to guide the generation of complex document table images, ensuring a realistic representation of table layouts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the generated data, we employ the popular YOLOv5 object detection model for training. The generated table images serve as valuable training samples, enriching the dataset with diverse table structures. The model is subsequently tested on the challenging pubtables-1m testset, a benchmark for table structure recognition in complex document layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that the introduced approach significantly improves the quality of synthetic data for training, leading to YOLOv5 models with enhanced performance. The mean Average Precision (mAP) values obtained on the pubtables-1m testset showcase results closely aligned with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, low FID results obtained on the synthetic data further validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in generating annotated images for table structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICDAR 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we focus on the problem of compositional representation learning for music data, specifically targeting the fully-unsupervised setting. We propose a simple and extensible framework that leverages an explicit compositional inductive bias, defined by a flexible auto-encoding objective that can leverage any of the current state-of-art generative models. We demonstrate that our framework, used with diffusion models, naturally addresses the task of unsupervised audio source separation, showing that our model is able to perform high-quality separation. Our findings reveal that our proposal achieves comparable or superior performance with respect to other blind source separation methods and, furthermore, it even surpasses current state-of-art supervised baselines on signal-to-interference ratio metrics. Additionally, by learning an a-posteriori masking diffusion model in the space of composable representations, we achieve a system capable of seamlessly performing unsupervised source separation, unconditional generation, and variation generation. Finally, as our proposal works in the latent space of pre-trained neural audio codecs, it also provides a lower computational cost with respect to other neural baselines.</p></details> | ISMIR 2024 |
| **[Propagating the prior from shallow to deep with a pre-trained velocity-model Generative Transformer network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09767v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building subsurface velocity models is essential to our goals in utilizing seismic data for Earth discovery and exploration, as well as monitoring. With the dawn of machine learning, these velocity models (or, more precisely, their distribution) can be stored accurately and efficiently in a generative model. These stored velocity model distributions can be utilized to regularize or quantify uncertainties in inverse problems, like full waveform inversion. However, most generators, like normalizing flows or diffusion models, treat the image (velocity model) uniformly, disregarding spatial dependencies and resolution changes with respect to the observation locations. To address this weakness, we introduce VelocityGPT, a novel implementation that utilizes Transformer decoders trained autoregressively to generate a velocity model from shallow subsurface to deep. Owing to the fact that seismic data are often recorded on the Earth's surface, a top-down generator can utilize the inverted information in the shallow as guidance (prior) to generating the deep. To facilitate the implementation, we use an additional network to compress the velocity model. We also inject prior information, like well or structure (represented by a migration image) to generate the velocity model. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VelocityGPT as a promising approach in generative model applications for seismic velocity model building.</p></details> |  |

While recent large-scale diffusion models have shown strong generative and inpainting capabilities, we find that current models do not sufficiently "understand" the scene shown in a single picture to generate consistent lighting effects (shadows, bright reflections, etc.) while preserving the identity and details of the composited object. We propose using a personalized large diffusion model as guidance to a physically based inverse rendering process. Our method recovers scene lighting and tone-mapping parameters, allowing the photorealistic composition of arbitrary virtual objects in single frames or videos of indoor or outdoor scenes. Our physically based pipeline further enables automatic materials and tone-mapping refinement.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024, Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/DiPIR/</p></details> |

Based on the fact that natural images exhibit high self-similarities, i.e., a local patch can have many similar patches to it in the whole image, in this work we propose a simple yet effective self-similarity loss (SSL) to improve the performance of generative Real-ISR models, enhancing the hallucination of structural and textural details while reducing the unpleasant visual artifacts. Specifically, we compute a self-similarity graph (SSG) of the ground-truth image, and enforce the SSG of Real-ISR output to be close to it. To reduce the training cost and focus on edge areas, we generate an edge mask from the ground-truth image, and compute the SSG only on the masked pixels. The proposed SSL serves as a general plug-and-play penalty, which could be easily applied to the off-the-shelf Real-ISR models. Our experiments demonstrate that, by coupling with SSL, the performance of many state-of-the-art Real-ISR models, including those GAN and DM based ones, can be largely improved, reproducing more perceptually realistic image details and eliminating many false reconstructions and visual artifacts.

Recent foundation models, such as transformers and diffusion models, despite their efficacy in various domains, are limited in use on edge devices due to their computational complexity and slow inference times. We introduce ExpoMamba, a novel architecture that integrates components of the frequency state space within a modified U-Net, offering a blend of efficiency and effectiveness. This model is specifically optimized to address mixed exposure challenges, a common issue in low-light image enhancement, while ensuring computational efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that ExpoMamba enhances low-light images up to 2-3x faster than traditional models with an inference time of 36.6 ms and achieves a PSNR improvement of approximately 15-20% over competing models, making it highly suitable for real-time image processing applications.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses these issues by distilling a constructive PCG algorithm into a controllable PCGML model. We first generate a large amount of content with a constructive algorithm and label it using a Large Language Model (LLM). We use these synthetic labels to condition two PCGML models for content-specific generation, a diffusion model and the five-dollar model. This neural network distillation process ensures that the generation aligns with the original algorithm while introducing controllability through plain text. We define this text-conditioned PCGML as a Text-to-game-Map (T2M) task, offering an alternative to prevalent text-to-image multi-modal tasks. We compare our distilled models with the baseline constructive algorithm. Our analysis of the variety, accuracy, and quality of our generation demonstrates the efficacy of distilling constructive methods into controllable text-conditioned PCGML models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Feedback Helps CLIP See Better](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20171v3)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), which excels at abstracting open-world representations across domains and modalities, has become a foundation for a variety of vision and multimodal tasks. However, recent studies reveal that CLIP has severe visual shortcomings, such as which can hardly distinguish orientation, quantity, color, structure, etc. These visual shortcomings also limit the perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) built on CLIP. The main reason could be that the image-text pairs used to train CLIP are inherently biased, due to the lack of the distinctiveness of the text and the diversity of images. In this work, we present a simple post-training approach for CLIP models, which largely overcomes its visual shortcomings via a self-supervised diffusion process. We introduce DIVA, which uses the DIffusion model as a Visual Assistant for CLIP. Specifically, DIVA leverages generative feedback from text-to-image diffusion models to optimize CLIP representations, with only images (without corresponding text). We demonstrate that DIVA improves CLIP's performance on the challenging MMVP-VLM benchmark which assesses fine-grained visual abilities to a large extent (e.g., 3-7%), and enhances the performance of MLLMs and vision models on multimodal understanding and segmentation tasks. Extensive evaluation on 29 image classification and retrieval benchmarks confirms that our framework preserves CLIP's strong zero-shot capabilities.

This severely hinders their ability to make precise decisions, particularly during decentralized execution. To alleviate this problem and inspired by image outpainting, we propose State Inference with Diffusion Models (SIDIFF), which uses diffusion models to reconstruct the original global state based solely on local observations. SIDIFF consists of a state generator and a state extractor, which allow agents to choose suitable actions by considering both the reconstructed global state and local observations. In addition, SIDIFF can be effortlessly incorporated into current multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to improve their performance. Finally, we evaluated SIDIFF on different experimental platforms, including Multi-Agent Battle City (MABC), a novel and flexible multi-agent reinforcement learning environment we developed. SIDIFF achieved desirable results and outperformed other popular algorithms.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

Previous works often adopt generative adversarial networks or regression models, which are plagued by generation quality and average facial shape problem. Although diffusion models show impressive generative ability, their exploration in talking head generation remains unsatisfactory. This is because they either solely use the diffusion model to obtain an intermediate representation and then employ another pre-trained renderer, or they overlook the feature decoupling of complex facial details, such as expressions, head poses and appearance textures. Therefore, we propose a Facial Decoupled Diffusion model for Talking head generation called FD2Talk, which fully leverages the advantages of diffusion models and decouples the complex facial details through multi-stages. Specifically, we separate facial details into motion and appearance. In the initial phase, we design the Diffusion Transformer to accurately predict motion coefficients from raw audio. These motions are highly decoupled from appearance, making them easier for the network to learn compared to high-dimensional RGB images. Subsequently, in the second phase, we encode the reference image to capture appearance textures. The predicted facial and head motions and encoded appearance then serve as the conditions for the Diffusion UNet, guiding the frame generation. Benefiting from decoupling facial details and fully leveraging diffusion models, extensive experiments substantiate that our approach excels in enhancing image quality and generating more accurate and diverse results compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2024</p></details> |
| **[DiffLoRA: Generating Personalized Low-Rank Adaptation Weights with Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06740v2)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized text-to-image generation has gained significant attention for its capability to generate high-fidelity portraits of specific identities conditioned on user-defined prompts. Existing methods typically involve test-time fine-tuning or instead incorporating an additional pre-trained branch. However, these approaches struggle to simultaneously address the demands of efficiency, identity fidelity, and preserving the model's original generative capabilities. In this paper, we propose DiffLoRA, a novel approach that leverages diffusion models as a hypernetwork to predict personalized low-rank adaptation (LoRA) weights based on the reference images. By integrating these LoRA weights into the text-to-image model, DiffLoRA achieves personalization during inference without further training. Additionally, we propose an identity-oriented LoRA weight construction pipeline to facilitate the training of DiffLoRA. By utilizing the dataset produced by this pipeline, our DiffLoRA consistently generates high-performance and accurate LoRA weights. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving both time efficiency and maintaining identity fidelity throughout the personalization process.</p></details> | 9 pages,8 figures |
| **[Unpaired Volumetric Harmonization of Brain MRI with Conditional Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09315v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-site structural MRI is increasingly used in neuroimaging studies to diversify subject cohorts. However, combining MR images acquired from various sites/centers may introduce site-related non-biological variations. Retrospective image harmonization helps address this issue, but current methods usually perform harmonization on pre-extracted hand-crafted radiomic features, limiting downstream applicability. Several image-level approaches focus on 2D slices, disregarding inherent volumetric information, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To this end, we propose a novel 3D MRI Harmonization framework through Conditional Latent Diffusion (HCLD) by explicitly considering image style and brain anatomy. It comprises a generalizable 3D autoencoder that encodes and decodes MRIs through a 4D latent space, and a conditional latent diffusion model that learns the latent distribution and generates harmonized MRIs with anatomical information from source MRIs while conditioned on target image style. This enables efficient volume-level MRI harmonization through latent style translation, without requiring paired images from target and source domains during training. The HCLD is trained and evaluated on 4,158 T1-weighted brain MRIs from three datasets in three tasks, assessing its ability to remove site-related variations while retaining essential biological features. Qualitative and quantitative experiments suggest the effectiveness of HCLD over several state-of-the-arts</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving EEG Classification Through Randomly Reassembling Original and Generated Data with Transformer-based Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20253v2)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has been widely used in various medical and engineering applications, where it is important for understanding brain function, diagnosing diseases, and assessing mental health conditions. However, the scarcity of EEG data severely restricts the performance of EEG classification networks, and generative model-based data augmentation methods have emerged as potential solutions to overcome this challenge. There are two problems with existing methods: (1) The quality of the generated EEG signals is not high; (2) The enhancement of EEG classification networks is not effective. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a generated data-based augmentation method to address the above two problems. For the characteristics of EEG signals, we propose a constant-factor scaling method to preprocess the signals, which reduces the loss of information. We incorporated Multi-Scale Convolution and Dynamic Fourier Spectrum Information modules into the model, improving the stability of the training process and the quality of the generated data. The proposed augmentation method randomly reassemble the generated data with original data in the time-domain to obtain vicinal data, which improves the model performance by minimizing the empirical risk and the vicinal risk. We verify the proposed augmentation method on four EEG datasets for four tasks and observe significant accuracy performance improvements: 14.00% on the Bonn dataset; 6.38% on the SleepEDF-20 dataset; 9.42% on the FACED dataset; 2.5% on the Shu dataset. We will make the code of our method publicly accessible soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepControlNet: ControlNet Reparameterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09240v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the wide application of diffusion model, the high cost of inference resources has became an important bottleneck for its universal application. Controllable generation, such as ControlNet, is one of the key research directions of diffusion model, and the research related to inference acceleration and model compression is more important. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a modal reparameterization method, RepControlNet, to realize the controllable generation of diffusion models without increasing computation. In the training process, RepControlNet uses the adapter to modulate the modal information into the feature space, copy the CNN and MLP learnable layers of the original diffusion model as the modal network, and initialize these weights based on the original weights and coefficients. The training process only optimizes the parameters of the modal network. In the inference process, the weights of the neutralization original diffusion model in the modal network are reparameterized, which can be compared with or even surpass the methods such as ControlNet, which use additional parameters and computational quantities, without increasing the number of parameters. We have carried out a large number of experiments on both SD1.5 and SDXL, and the experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed RepControlNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[DP-IQA: Utilizing Diffusion Prior for Blind Image Quality Assessment in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19996v4)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind image quality assessment (IQA) in the wild, which assesses the quality of images with complex authentic distortions and no reference images, presents significant challenges. Given the difficulty in collecting large-scale training data, leveraging limited data to develop a model with strong generalization remains an open problem. Motivated by the robust image perception capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, we propose a novel IQA method, diffusion priors-based IQA (DP-IQA), to utilize the T2I model's prior for improved performance and generalization ability. Specifically, we utilize pre-trained Stable Diffusion as the backbone, extracting multi-level features from the denoising U-Net guided by prompt embeddings through a tunable text adapter. Simultaneously, an image adapter compensates for information loss introduced by the lossy pre-trained encoder. Unlike T2I models that require full image distribution modeling, our approach targets image quality assessment, which inherently requires fewer parameters. To improve applicability, we distill the knowledge into a lightweight CNN-based student model, significantly reducing parameters while maintaining or even enhancing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that DP-IQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on various in-the-wild datasets, highlighting the superior generalization capability of T2I priors in blind IQA tasks. To our knowledge, DP-IQA is the first method to apply pre-trained diffusion priors in blind IQA. Codes and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/RomGai/DP-IQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are CLIP features all you need for Universal Synthetic Image Origin Attribution?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09153v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The steady improvement of Diffusion Models for visual synthesis has given rise to many new and interesting use cases of synthetic images but also has raised concerns about their potential abuse, which poses significant societal threats. To address this, fake images need to be detected and attributed to their source model, and given the frequent release of new generators, realistic applications need to consider an Open-Set scenario where some models are unseen at training time. Existing forensic techniques are either limited to Closed-Set settings or to GAN-generated images, relying on fragile frequency-based "fingerprint" features. By contrast, we propose a simple yet effective framework that incorporates features from large pre-trained foundation models to perform Open-Set origin attribution of synthetic images produced by various generative models, including Diffusion Models. We show that our method leads to remarkable attribution performance, even in the low-data regime, exceeding the performance of existing methods and generalizes better on images obtained from a diverse set of architectures.

| **[Realistic Extreme Image Rescaling via Generative Latent Space Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09151v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image rescaling aims to learn the optimal downscaled low-resolution (LR) image that can be accurately reconstructed to its original high-resolution (HR) counterpart. This process is crucial for efficient image processing and storage, especially in the era of ultra-high definition media. However, extreme downscaling factors pose significant challenges due to the highly ill-posed nature of the inverse upscaling process, causing existing methods to struggle in generating semantically plausible structures and perceptually rich textures. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Latent Space Based Image Rescaling (LSBIR) for extreme image rescaling tasks. LSBIR effectively leverages powerful natural image priors learned by a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to generate realistic HR images. The rescaling is performed in the latent space of a pre-trained image encoder and decoder, which offers better perceptual reconstruction quality due to its stronger sparsity and richer semantics. LSBIR adopts a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a pseudo-invertible encoder-decoder models the bidirectional mapping between the latent features of the HR image and the target-sized LR image. In the second stage, the reconstructed features from the first stage are refined by a pre-trained diffusion model to generate more faithful and visually pleasing details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LSBIR over previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The code will be available at: https://github.com/wwangcece/LSBIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkyDiffusion: Street-to-Satellite Image Synthesis with Diffusion Models and BEV Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01812v2)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Street-to-satellite image synthesis focuses on generating realistic satellite images from corresponding ground street-view images while maintaining a consistent content layout, similar to looking down from the sky. The significant differences in perspectives create a substantial domain gap between the views, making this cross-view generation task particularly challenging. In this paper, we introduce SkyDiffusion, a novel cross-view generation method for synthesizing satellite images from street-view images, leveraging diffusion models and Bird's Eye View (BEV) paradigm. First, we design a Curved-BEV method to transform street-view images to the satellite view, reformulating the challenging cross-domain image synthesis task into a conditional generation problem. Curved-BEV also includes a "Multi-to-One" mapping strategy for leveraging multiple street-view images within the same satellite coverage area, effectively solving the occlusion issues in dense urban scenes. Next, we design a BEV-controlled diffusion model to generate satellite images consistent with the street-view content, which also incorporates a light manipulation module to make the lighting conditions of the synthesized satellite images more flexible. Experimental results demonstrate that SkyDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both suburban (CVUSA & CVACT) and urban (VIGOR-Chicago) cross-view datasets, with an average SSIM increase of 13.96% and a FID reduction of 20.54%, achieving realistic and content-consistent satellite image generation.

Despite the plausible generated appearance, existing methods cannot achieve fine-grained disentanglement or high-fidelity modeling between inner body and outfit. In this paper, we propose Barbie, a novel framework for generating 3D avatars that can be dressed in diverse and high-quality Barbie-like garments and accessories. Instead of relying on a holistic model, Barbie achieves fine-grained disentanglement on avatars by semantic-aligned separated models for human body and outfits. These disentangled 3D representations are then optimized by different expert models to guarantee the domain-specific fidelity. To balance geometry diversity and reasonableness, we propose a series of losses for template-preserving and human-prior evolving. The final avatar is enhanced by unified texture refinement for superior texture consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Barbie outperforms existing methods in both dressed human and outfit generation, supporting flexible apparel combination and animation. The code will be released for research purposes. Our project page is: https://2017211801.github.io/barbie.github.io/.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fragment-Masked Molecular Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09106v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, aimed at refining molecular structures to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, ultimately accelerating the overall drug development process. Many target-based molecular optimization methods have been proposed, significantly advancing drug discovery. These methods primarily on understanding the specific drug target structures or their hypothesized roles in combating diseases. However, challenges such as a limited number of available targets and a difficulty capturing clear structures hinder innovative drug development. In contrast, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) does not depend on clear target structures and can identify hits with novel and unbiased polypharmacology signatures. As a result, PDD-based molecular optimization can reduce potential safety risks while optimizing phenotypic activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical success. Therefore, we propose a fragment-masked molecular optimization method based on PDD (FMOP). FMOP employs a regression-free diffusion model to conditionally optimize the molecular masked regions without training, effectively generating new molecules with similar scaffolds. On the large-scale drug response dataset GDSCv2, we optimize the potential molecules across all 945 cell lines. The overall experiments demonstrate that the in-silico optimization success rate reaches 94.4%, with an average efficacy increase of 5.3%. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation and visualization experiments, confirming that FMOP is an effective and robust molecular optimization method.

However, due to the naturally significant sequence length of audio, the efficiency of audio generation remains an essential issue to be addressed, especially for AR models that are incorporated in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we analyze the token length of audio tokenization and propose a novel \textbf{S}cale-level \textbf{A}udio \textbf{T}okenizer (SAT), with improved residual quantization. Based on SAT, a scale-level \textbf{A}coustic \textbf{A}uto\textbf{R}egressive (AAR) modeling framework is further proposed, which shifts the next-token AR prediction to next-scale AR prediction, significantly reducing the training cost and inference time.

CFG is the dominant method of conditional sampling for text-to-image diffusion models, yet unlike other aspects of diffusion, it remains on shaky theoretical footing. In this paper, we disprove common misconceptions, by showing that CFG interacts differently with DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and DDIM (Song et al., 2021), and neither sampler with CFG generates the gamma-powered distribution $p(x|c)^\gamma p(x)^{1-\gamma}$. Then, we clarify the behavior of CFG by showing that it is a kind of predictor-corrector method (Song et al., 2020) that alternates between denoising and sharpening, which we call predictor-corrector guidance (PCG). We prove that in the SDE limit, CFG is actually equivalent to combining a DDIM predictor for the conditional distribution together with a Langevin dynamics corrector for a gamma-powered distribution (with a carefully chosen gamma). Our work thus provides a lens to theoretically understand CFG by embedding it in a broader design space of principled sampling methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AB an...</summary><p>AB and PN contributed equally</p></details> |

While this technique has facilitated notable speed improvements by enabling parallel sequence verification, its efficiency remains inherently limited by the reliance on incremental token generation in existing draft models. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an adaptation of speculative decoding which uses discrete diffusion models to generate draft sequences. This allows parallelization of both the drafting and verification steps, providing significant speed-ups to the inference process. Our proposed approach, Speculative Diffusion Decoding (SpecDiff), is validated on standard language generation benchmarks and empirically demonstrated to provide a up to 8.7x speed-up over standard generation processes and up to 2.5x speed-up over existing speculative decoding approaches.</p></details> |  |

To further improve T2I models' capability in numerical and spatial reasoning, the layout is employed as an intermedium to bridge large language models and layout-based diffusion models. However, these methods still struggle with generating images from textural prompts with multiple objects and complicated spatial relationships. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a divide-and-conquer approach which decouples the T2I generation task into simple subtasks. Our approach divides the layout prediction stage into numerical & spatial reasoning and bounding box prediction. Then, the layout-to-image generation stage is conducted in an iterative manner to reconstruct objects from easy ones to difficult ones. We conduct experiments on the HRS and NSR-1K benchmarks and our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art models with notable margins. In addition, visual results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the controllability and consistency in generating multiple objects from complex textural prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[PFDiff: Training-free Acceleration of Diffusion Models through the Gradient Guidance of Past and Future](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08822v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have shown remarkable potential in image generation, but their sampling efficiency is hindered by the need for numerous denoising steps. Most existing solutions accelerate the sampling process by proposing fast ODE solvers. However, the inevitable discretization errors of the ODE solvers are significantly magnified when the number of function evaluations (NFE) is fewer. In this work, we propose PFDiff, a novel training-free and orthogonal timestep-skipping strategy, which enables existing fast ODE solvers to operate with fewer NFE. Based on two key observations: a significant similarity in the model's outputs at time step size that is not excessively large during the denoising process of existing ODE solvers, and a high resemblance between the denoising process and SGD. PFDiff, by employing gradient replacement from past time steps and foresight updates inspired by Nesterov momentum, rapidly updates intermediate states, thereby reducing unnecessary NFE while correcting for discretization errors inherent in first-order ODE solvers. Experimental results demonstrate that PFDiff exhibits flexible applicability across various pre-trained DPMs, particularly excelling in conditional DPMs and surpassing previous state-of-the-art training-free methods. For instance, using DDIM as a baseline, we achieved 16.46 FID (4 NFE) compared to 138.81 FID with DDIM on ImageNet 64x64 with classifier guidance, and 13.06 FID (10 NFE) on Stable Diffusion with 7.5 guidance scale.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous works, our method leads to proper diffusion models, which is crucial for downstream tasks. As part of our method, we propose and motivate an improved posterior sampling scheme for unconditional diffusion models. We present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have achieved remarkable performance by utilizing autoregressive models or diffusion models. However, most still suffer from modality inconsistencies, specifically the misalignment between audio and mesh modalities, which causes inconsistencies in motion diversity and lip-sync accuracy. To address this issue, this paper introduces GLDiTalker, a novel speech-driven 3D facial animation model that employs a Graph Latent Diffusion Transformer. The core idea behind GLDiTalker is that the audio-mesh modality misalignment can be resolved by diffusing the signal in a latent quantilized spatial-temporal space. To achieve this, GLDiTalker builds upon a quantilized space-time diffusion training pipeline, which consists of a Graph Enhanced Quantilized Space Learning Stage and a Space-Time Powered Latent Diffusion Stage. The first stage ensures lip-sync accuracy, while the second stage enhances motion diversity. Together, these stages enable GLDiTalker to generate temporally and spatially stable, realistic models. Extensive evaluations on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

| **[As Generative Models Improve, People Adapt Their Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14333v2)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an online experiment with N = 1893 participants, we collected and analyzed over 18,000 prompts and over 300,000 images to explore how the importance of prompting will change as the capabilities of generative AI models continue to improve. Each participant in our experiment was randomly and blindly assigned to use one of three text-to-image diffusion models: DALL-E 2, its more advanced successor DALL-E 3, or a version of DALL-E 3 with automatic prompt revision. Participants were then asked to write prompts to reproduce a target image as closely as possible in 10 consecutive tries. We find that task performance was higher for participants using DALL-E 3 than for those using DALL-E 2. This performance gap corresponds to a noticeable difference in the similarity of participants' images to their target images, and was caused in equal measure by: (1) the increased technical capabilities of DALL-E 3, and (2) endogenous changes in participants' prompting in response to these increased capabilities. More specifically, despite being blind to the model they were assigned, participants assigned to DALL-E 3 wrote longer prompts that were more semantically similar to each other and contained a greater number of descriptive words. Furthermore, while participants assigned to DALL-E 3 with prompt revision still outperformed those assigned to DALL-E 2, automatic prompt revision reduced the benefits of using DALL-E 3 by 58\%. Taken together, our results suggest that as models continue to progress, people will continue to adapt their prompts to take advantage of new models' capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[An End-to-End Model for Photo-Sharing Multi-modal Dialogue Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08650v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo-Sharing Multi-modal dialogue generation requires a dialogue agent not only to generate text responses but also to share photos at the proper moment. Using image text caption as the bridge, a pipeline model integrates an image caption model, a text generation model, and an image generation model to handle this complex multi-modal task. However, representing the images with text captions may loss important visual details and information and cause error propagation in the complex dialogue system. Besides, the pipeline model isolates the three models separately because discrete image text captions hinder end-to-end gradient propagation. We propose the first end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation, which integrates an image perceptron and an image generator with a large language model. The large language model employs the Q-Former to perceive visual images in the input end. For image generation in the output end, we propose a dynamic vocabulary transformation matrix and use straight-through and gumbel-softmax techniques to align the large language model and stable diffusion model and achieve end-to-end gradient propagation. We perform experiments on PhotoChat and DialogCC datasets to evaluate our end-to-end model. Compared with pipeline models, the end-to-end model gains state-of-the-art performances on various metrics of text and image generation. More analysis experiments also verify the effectiveness of the end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation.</p></details> | Work in progress |

In this work, we model the neonatal development of the infant brain in this age range. As a basis, we use MR images of preterm- and term-birth neonates from the developing human connectome project (dHCP). We propose a neural network, specifically an implicit neural representation (INR), to predict 2D- and 3D images of varying time points. In order to model a subject-specific development process, it is necessary to disentangle the age from the subjects' identity in the latent space of the INR. We propose two methods, Subject Specific Latent Vectors (SSL) and Stochastic Global Latent Augmentation (SGLA), enabling this disentanglement. We perform an analysis of the results and compare our proposed model to an age-conditioned denoising diffusion model as a baseline. We also show that our method can be applied in a memory-efficient way, which is especially important for 3D data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Accepted for PRIME MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

Since the diffusion model has become the mainstay of generative models because of its high-quality generative effects, we focus on distillation methods based on the diffusion model. Considering that the track can only generate a fixed number of images in 10 minutes using a generative model for CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, we need to use a generative model that can generate images at high speed. In this study, we proposed a novel generative dataset distillation method based on Stable Diffusion. Specifically, we use the SDXL-Turbo model which can generate images at high speed and quality. Compared to other diffusion models that can only generate images per class (IPC) = 1, our method can achieve an IPC = 10 for Tiny-ImageNet and an IPC = 20 for CIFAR-100, respectively. Additionally, to generate high-quality distilled datasets for CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we use the class information as text prompts and post data augmentation for the SDXL-Turbo model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieved third place in the generative track of the ECCV 2024 DD Challenge.

| **[Fair Sampling in Diffusion Models through Switching Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03140v4)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown their effectiveness in generation tasks by well-approximating the underlying probability distribution. However, diffusion models are known to suffer from an amplified inherent bias from the training data in terms of fairness. While the sampling process of diffusion models can be controlled by conditional guidance, previous works have attempted to find empirical guidance to achieve quantitative fairness. To address this limitation, we propose a fairness-aware sampling method called \textit{attribute switching} mechanism for diffusion models. Without additional training, the proposed sampling can obfuscate sensitive attributes in generated data without relying on classifiers. We mathematically prove and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two key aspects: (i) the generation of fair data and (ii) the preservation of the utility of the generated data.</p></details> | AAAI 2024 |
| **[RadioDiff: An Effective Generative Diffusion Model for Sampling-Free Dynamic Radio Map Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08593v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio map (RM) is a promising technology that can obtain pathloss based on only location, which is significant for 6G network applications to reduce the communication costs for pathloss estimation. However, the construction of RM in traditional is either computationally intensive or depends on costly sampling-based pathloss measurements. Although the neural network (NN)-based method can efficiently construct the RM without sampling, its performance is still suboptimal. This is primarily due to the misalignment between the generative characteristics of the RM construction problem and the discrimination modeling exploited by existing NN-based methods. Thus, to enhance RM construction performance, in this paper, the sampling-free RM construction is modeled as a conditional generative problem, where a denoised diffusion-based method, named RadioDiff, is proposed to achieve high-quality RM construction. In addition, to enhance the diffusion model's capability of extracting features from dynamic environments, an attention U-Net with an adaptive fast Fourier transform module is employed as the backbone network to improve the dynamic environmental features extracting capability. Meanwhile, the decoupled diffusion model is utilized to further enhance the construction performance of RMs. Moreover, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of why the RM construction is a generative problem is provided for the first time, from both perspectives of data features and NN training methods. Experimental results show that the proposed RadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in all three metrics of accuracy, structural similarity, and peak signal-to-noise ratio.

| **[Reliable Generation of Privacy-preserving Synthetic EHR Time Series via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15290v3)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are rich sources of patient-level data, offering valuable resources for medical data analysis. However, privacy concerns often restrict access to EHRs, hindering downstream analysis. Current EHR de-identification methods are flawed and can lead to potential privacy leakage. Additionally, existing publicly available EHR databases are limited, preventing the advancement of medical research using EHR. This study aims to overcome these challenges by generating realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) time series efficiently. We introduce a new method for generating diverse and realistic synthetic EHR time series data using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). We conducted experiments on six databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV (MIMIC-III/IV), the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU), and non-EHR datasets on Stocks and Energy. We compared our proposed method with eight existing methods. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of data fidelity while requiring less training effort. Additionally, data generated by our method yields a lower discriminative accuracy compared to other baseline methods, indicating the proposed method can generate data with less privacy risk. The proposed diffusion-model-based method can reliably and efficiently generate synthetic EHR time series, which facilitates the downstream medical data analysis. Our numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over all other existing methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Linear combinations of latents in diffusion models: interpolation and beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08558v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models are crucial for applications like data synthesis and augmentation. Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalizing Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on Gaussian latent variables for generation. As any generated object is directly associated with a particular latent variable, we can manipulate the variables to exert control over the generation process. However, standard approaches for combining latent variables, such as spherical interpolation, only apply or work well in special cases. Moreover, current methods for obtaining low-dimensional representations of the data, important for e.g. surrogate models for search and creative applications, are network and data modality specific. In this work we show that the standard methods to combine variables do not yield intermediates following the distribution the models are trained to expect. We propose Combination of Gaussian variables (COG), a novel interpolation method that addresses this, is easy to implement yet matches or improves upon current methods. COG addresses linear combinations in general and, as we demonstrate, also supports other operations including e.g. defining subspaces of the latent space, simplifying the creation of expressive low-dimensional spaces of high-dimensional objects using generative models based on Gaussian latents.</p></details> |  |

This difficulty arises from the complex task of learning the physical structure and pose of hands from training images, which involves extensive deformations and occlusions. For correct hand generation, our paper introduces a lightweight post-processing solution called $\textbf{HandRefiner}$. HandRefiner employs a conditional inpainting approach to rectify malformed hands while leaving other parts of the image untouched. We leverage the hand mesh reconstruction model that consistently adheres to the correct number of fingers and hand shape, while also being capable of fitting the desired hand pose in the generated image. Given a generated failed image due to malformed hands, we utilize ControlNet modules to re-inject such correct hand information. Additionally, we uncover a phase transition phenomenon within ControlNet as we vary the control strength. It enables us to take advantage of more readily available synthetic data without suffering from the domain gap between realistic and synthetic hands. Experiments demonstrate that HandRefiner can significantly improve the generation quality quantitatively and qualitatively.

To address this, researchers have proposed machine learning approaches for inverse design that can predict higher-resolution solutions from lower cost/resolution ones. Due to the recent success of diffusion models over traditional generative models, we extend the use of diffusion models for multi-resolution tasks by proposing the conditional cascaded diffusion model (cCDM). Compared to GANs, cCDM is more stable to train, and each diffusion model within the cCDM can be trained independently, thus each model's parameters can be tuned separately to maximize the performance of the pipeline. Our study compares cCDM against a cGAN model with transfer learning. Our results demonstrate that the cCDM excels in capturing finer details, preserving volume fraction constraints, and minimizing compliance errors in multi-resolution tasks when a sufficient amount of high-resolution training data (more than 102 designs) is available. Furthermore, we explore the impact of training data size on the performance of both models. While both models show decreased performance with reduced high-resolution training data, the cCDM loses its superiority to the cGAN model with transfer learning when training data is limited (less than 102), and we show the break-even point for this transition. Also, we highlight that while the diffusion model may achieve better pixel-wise performance in both low-resolution and high-resolution scenarios, this does not necessarily guarantee that the model produces optimal compliance error or constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IDETC/CIE 2024 conference, Washington, DC. 11 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[AdaDiff: Accelerating Diffusion Models through Step-Wise Adaptive Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17074v3)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models achieve great success in generating diverse and high-fidelity images, yet their widespread application, especially in real-time scenarios, is hampered by their inherently slow generation speed. The slow generation stems from the necessity of multi-step network inference. While some certain predictions benefit from the full computation of the model in each sampling iteration, not every iteration requires the same amount of computation, potentially leading to inefficient computation. Unlike typical adaptive computation challenges that deal with single-step generation problems, diffusion processes with a multi-step generation need to dynamically adjust their computational resource allocation based on the ongoing assessment of each step's importance to the final image output, presenting a unique set of challenges. In this work, we propose AdaDiff, an adaptive framework that dynamically allocates computation resources in each sampling step to improve the generation efficiency of diffusion models. To assess the effects of changes in computational effort on image quality, we present a timestep-aware uncertainty estimation module (UEM). Integrated at each intermediate layer, the UEM evaluates the predictive uncertainty. This uncertainty measurement serves as an indicator for determining whether to terminate the inference process. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware layer-wise loss aimed at bridging the performance gap between full models and their adaptive counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Researchers attempt to prevent malicious personalization using adversarial perturbations. However, previous efforts have mainly focused on the effectiveness of protection while neglecting the visibility of perturbations. They utilize global adversarial perturbations, which introduce noticeable alterations to original images and significantly degrade visual quality. In this work, we propose the Visual-Friendly Concept Protection (VCPro) framework, which prioritizes the protection of key concepts chosen by the image owner through adversarial perturbations with lower perceptibility. To ensure these perturbations are as inconspicuous as possible, we introduce a relaxed optimization objective to identify the least perceptible yet effective adversarial perturbations, solved using the Lagrangian multiplier method. Qualitative and quantitative experiments validate that VCPro achieves a better trade-off between the visibility of perturbations and protection effectiveness, effectively prioritizing the protection of target concepts in images with less perceptible perturbations.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Efficient Image-to-Image Diffusion Classifier for Adversarial Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08502v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated great potential in the field of adversarial robustness, where DM-based defense methods can achieve superior defense capability without adversarial training. However, they all require huge computational costs due to the usage of large-scale pre-trained DMs, making it difficult to conduct full evaluation under strong attacks and compare with traditional CNN-based methods. Simply reducing the network size and timesteps in DMs could significantly harm the image generation quality, which invalidates previous frameworks. To alleviate this issue, we redesign the diffusion framework from generating high-quality images to predicting distinguishable image labels. Specifically, we employ an image translation framework to learn many-to-one mapping from input samples to designed orthogonal image labels. Based on this framework, we introduce an efficient Image-to-Image diffusion classifier with a pruned U-Net structure and reduced diffusion timesteps. Besides the framework, we redesign the optimization objective of DMs to fit the target of image classification, where a new classification loss is incorporated in the DM-based image translation framework to distinguish the generated label from those of other classes. We conduct sufficient evaluations of the proposed classifier under various attacks on popular benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better adversarial robustness with fewer computational costs than DM-based and CNN-based methods.

| **[Achieving Complex Image Edits via Function Aggregation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08495v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in generative tasks, making them ideal candidates for image editing. Recent studies highlight their ability to apply desired edits effectively by following textual instructions, yet two key challenges persist. First, these models struggle to apply multiple edits simultaneously, resulting in computational inefficiencies due to their reliance on sequential processing. Second, relying on textual prompts to determine the editing region can lead to unintended alterations in other parts of the image. In this work, we introduce FunEditor, an efficient diffusion model designed to learn atomic editing functions and perform complex edits by aggregating simpler functions. This approach enables complex editing tasks, such as object movement, by aggregating multiple functions and applying them simultaneously to specific areas. FunEditor is 5 to 24 times faster inference than existing methods on complex tasks like object movement. Our experiments demonstrate that FunEditor significantly outperforms recent baselines, including both inference-time optimization methods and fine-tuned models, across various metrics, such as image quality assessment (IQA) and object-background consistency.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we examine a generative model for a target task, fine-tuned using a pre-trained model from a source task. Building on the "Shared Embedding" concept, which bridges the source and target tasks, we introduce a novel framework for transfer learning under distribution metrics such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This framework underscores the importance of leveraging inherent similarities between diverse tasks despite their distinct data distributions. Our theory suggests that the shared structures can augment the generation accuracy for a target task, reliant on the capability of a source model to identify shared structures and effective knowledge transfer from source to target learning. To demonstrate the practical utility of this framework, we explore the theoretical implications for two specific generative models: diffusion and normalizing flows. The results show enhanced performance in both models over their non-transfer counterparts, indicating advancements for diffusion models and providing fresh insights into normalizing flows in transfer and non-transfer settings. These results highlight the significant contribution of knowledge transfer in boosting the generation capabilities of these models.</p></details> |  |

The success of diffusion models for image synthesis has led to the use of these models for motion synthesis. However, the majority of these motion diffusion models are primarily designed for offline applications, where space-time models are used to synthesize an entire sequence of frames simultaneously with a pre-specified length. To enable real-time motion synthesis with diffusion model that allows time-varying controls, we propose A-MDM (Auto-regressive Motion Diffusion Model). Our conditional diffusion model takes an initial pose as input, and auto-regressively generates successive motion frames conditioned on the previous frame. Despite its streamlined network architecture, which uses simple MLPs, our framework is capable of generating diverse, long-horizon, and high-fidelity motion sequences. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of techniques for incorporating interactive controls into A-MDM, such as task-oriented sampling, in-painting, and hierarchical reinforcement learning. These techniques enable a pre-trained A-MDM to be efficiently adapted for a variety of new downstream tasks. We conduct a comprehensive suite of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of A-MDM, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art auto-regressive methods.</p></details> |  |

However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.

However, the substantial volume of data associated with point clouds presents numerous challenges, particularly in terms of high bandwidth consumption and large storage capacity. Despite various solutions proposed thus far, with a focus on point cloud compression, upsampling, and completion, these reconstruction-related methods continue to fall short in delivering high fidelity point cloud output. As a solution, in DiffPMAE, we propose an effective point cloud reconstruction architecture. Inspired by self-supervised learning concepts, we combine Masked Auto-Encoding and Diffusion Model mechanism to remotely reconstruct point cloud data. By the nature of this reconstruction process, DiffPMAE can be extended to many related downstream tasks including point cloud compression, upsampling and completion. Leveraging ShapeNet-55 and ModelNet datasets with over 60000 objects, we validate the performance of DiffPMAE exceeding many state-of-the-art methods in-terms of auto-encoding and downstream tasks considered.</p></details> |  |

While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

We begin by evaluating T2I models' ability to innovate and generalize through controlled experiments, revealing that stable diffusion models can effectively recreate unseen elements with sufficiently diverse training data. Then, our key insight is that concepts and combinations of image elements the model is familiar with, and saw more during training, are more concisly represented in the model's latent space. We hence propose a method that leverages textual inversion to measure the originality of an image based on the number of tokens required for its reconstruction by the model. Our approach is inspired by legal definitions of originality and aims to assess whether a model can produce original content without relying on specific prompts or having the training data of the model. We demonstrate our method using both a pre-trained stable diffusion model and a synthetic dataset, showing a correlation between the number of tokens and image originality. This work contributes to the understanding of originality in generative models and has implications for copyright infringement cases.</p></details> | GenLaw ICML 2024 |

However, existing models tend to produce results with inconsistent motions and geometric structures over time. To this end, we present a novel framework, coined CT4D, which directly operates on animatable meshes for generating consistent 4D content from arbitrary user-supplied prompts. The primary challenges of our mesh-based framework involve stably generating a mesh with details that align with the text prompt while directly driving it and maintaining surface continuity. Our CT4D framework incorporates a unique Generate-Refine-Animate (GRA) algorithm to enhance the creation of text-aligned meshes. To improve surface continuity, we divide a mesh into several smaller regions and implement a uniform driving function within each area. Additionally, we constrain the animating stage with a rigidity regulation to ensure cross-region continuity. Our experimental results, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that our CT4D framework surpasses existing text-to-4D techniques in maintaining interframe consistency and preserving global geometry. Furthermore, we showcase that this enhanced representation inherently possesses the capability for combinational 4D generation and texture editing.</p></details> |  |

This provision would make it possible to clearly identify the creators of generative art. The main challenges that modern watermarking algorithms face have to do with their ability to withstand attacks and encrypt many unique messages, such as user IDs. In this paper, we present METR: Message Enhanced Tree-Ring, which is an approach that aims to address these challenges. METR is built on the Tree-Ring watermarking algorithm, a technique that makes it possible to encode multiple distinct messages without compromising attack resilience or image quality. This ensures the suitability of this watermarking algorithm for any Diffusion Model. In order to surpass the limitations on the quantity of encoded messages, we propose METR++, an enhanced version of METR. This approach, while limited to the Latent Diffusion Model architecture, is designed to inject a virtually unlimited number of unique messages.

With large-scale vision-language pre-training, diffusion models are able to generate high-quality images with rich texture and reasonable structure under different text prompts. However, it is an open problem to adapt the pre-trained diffusion model for visual perception. In this paper, we propose an implicit and explicit language guidance framework for diffusion-based perception, named IEDP. Our IEDP comprises an implicit language guidance branch and an explicit language guidance branch. The implicit branch employs frozen CLIP image encoder to directly generate implicit text embeddings that are fed to diffusion model, without using explicit text prompts. The explicit branch utilizes the ground-truth labels of corresponding images as text prompts to condition feature extraction of diffusion model. During training, we jointly train diffusion model by sharing the model weights of these two branches. As a result, implicit and explicit branches can jointly guide feature learning. During inference, we only employ implicit branch for final prediction, which does not require any ground-truth labels. Experiments are performed on two typical perception tasks, including semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Our IEDP achieves promising performance on both tasks. For semantic segmentation, our IEDP has the mIoU$^\text{ss}$ score of 55.9% on AD20K validation set, which outperforms the baseline method VPD by 2.2%. For depth estimation, our IEDP outperforms the baseline method VPD with a relative gain of 11.0%.</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE TMM |

However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. To deal with this challenge, research has been conducted on translating SAR images into optical-like representations to aid the interpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and GAN-based approaches, this paper introduces a conditional image-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR) images. The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional Diffusion Model (CDM) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Active Generation for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06517v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the growing capabilities of deep generative models have underscored their potential in enhancing image classification accuracy. However, existing methods often demand the generation of a disproportionately large number of images compared to the original dataset, while having only marginal improvements in accuracy. This computationally expensive and time-consuming process hampers the practicality of such approaches. In this paper, we propose to address the efficiency of image generation by focusing on the specific needs and characteristics of the model. With a central tenet of active learning, our method, named ActGen, takes a training-aware approach to image generation. It aims to create images akin to the challenging or misclassified samples encountered by the current model and incorporates these generated images into the training set to augment model performance. ActGen introduces an attentive image guidance technique, using real images as guides during the denoising process of a diffusion model. The model's attention on class prompt is leveraged to ensure the preservation of similar foreground object while diversifying the background. Furthermore, we introduce a gradient-based generation guidance method, which employs two losses to generate more challenging samples and prevent the generated images from being too similar to previously generated ones. Experimental results on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better performance with a significantly reduced number of generated images.

| **[EmoDM: A Diffusion Model for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15931v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary algorithms have been successful in solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). However, as a class of population-based search methodology, evolutionary algorithms require a large number of evaluations of the objective functions, preventing them from being applied to a wide range of expensive MOPs. To tackle the above challenge, this work proposes for the first time a diffusion model that can learn to perform evolutionary multi-objective search, called EmoDM. This is achieved by treating the reversed convergence process of evolutionary search as the forward diffusion and learn the noise distributions from previously solved evolutionary optimization tasks. The pre-trained EmoDM can then generate a set of non-dominated solutions for a new MOP by means of its reverse diffusion without further evolutionary search, thereby significantly reducing the required function evaluations. To enhance the scalability of EmoDM, a mutual entropy-based attention mechanism is introduced to capture the decision variables that are most important for the objectives. Experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of EmoDM in terms of both the search performance and computational efficiency compared with state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in solving MOPs having up to 5000 decision variables. The pre-trained EmoDM is shown to generalize well to unseen problems, revealing its strong potential as a general and efficient MOP solver.</p></details> |  |

To achieve greater control over generated results, researchers introduce additional architectures, such as ControlNet, Adapters and ReferenceNet, to integrate conditioning controls. However, current controllable generation methods often require substantial additional computational resources, especially for video generation, and face challenges in training or exhibit weak control. In this paper, we propose ControlNeXt: a powerful and efficient method for controllable image and video generation. We first design a more straightforward and efficient architecture, replacing heavy additional branches with minimal additional cost compared to the base model. Such a concise structure also allows our method to seamlessly integrate with other LoRA weights, enabling style alteration without the need for additional training. As for training, we reduce up to 90% of learnable parameters compared to the alternatives. Furthermore, we propose another method called Cross Normalization (CN) as a replacement for Zero-Convolution' to achieve fast and stable training convergence. We have conducted various experiments with different base models across images and videos, demonstrating the robustness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>contr...</summary><p>controllable generation</p></details> |

However, these methods ignore the modal gap between the 2D diffusion model and 3D objects, which primarily render 3D objects into 2D images and texture each image separately. In this paper, we revisit the texture synthesis and propose a Variance alignment based 3D-2D Collaborative Denoising framework, dubbed VCD-Texture, to address these issues. Formally, we first unify both 2D and 3D latent feature learning in diffusion self-attention modules with re-projected 3D attention receptive fields. Subsequently, the denoised multi-view 2D latent features are aggregated into 3D space and then rasterized back to formulate more consistent 2D predictions. However, the rasterization process suffers from an intractable variance bias, which is theoretically addressed by the proposed variance alignment, achieving high-fidelity texture synthesis. Moreover, we present an inpainting refinement to further improve the details with conflicting regions. Notably, there is not a publicly available benchmark to evaluate texture synthesis, which hinders its development. Thus we construct a new evaluation set built upon three open-source 3D datasets and propose to use four metrics to thoroughly validate the texturing performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VCD-Texture achieves superior performance against other counterparts.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

HawkI uses techniques from classical computer vision and information theory. It seamlessly blends the visual features from the input image within a pretrained text-to-2Dimage stable diffusion model with a test-time optimization process for a careful bias-variance trade-off, which uses an Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) homography transformation to provide subtle cues for aerialview synthesis. At inference, HawkI employs a unique mutual information guidance formulation to steer the generated image towards faithfully replicating the semantic details of the input-image, while maintaining a realistic aerial perspective. Mutual information guidance maximizes the semantic consistency between the generated image and the input image, without enforcing pixel-level correspondence between vastly different viewpoints. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons against text + exemplar-image based methods and 3D/ multi-view based novel-view synthesis methods on proposed synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves a significantly better bias-variance trade-off towards generating high fidelity aerial-view images.Code and data is available at https://github.com/divyakraman/HawkI2024.</p></details> |  |

We introduce an encoder based iterative inversion technique. The inversion network is conditioned on the input image and the reconstructed image from the previous step, allowing for correction of the next reconstruction towards the input image. We demonstrate that disentangled controls can be easily achieved in the few-step diffusion model by conditioning on an (automatically generated) detailed text prompt. To manipulate the inverted image, we freeze the noise maps and modify one attribute in the text prompt (either manually or via instruction based editing driven by an LLM), resulting in the generation of a new image similar to the input image with only one attribute changed. It can further control the editing strength and accept instructive text prompt. Our approach facilitates realistic text-guided image edits in real-time, requiring only 8 number of functional evaluations (NFEs) in inversion (one-time cost) and 4 NFEs per edit. Our method is not only fast, but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-step diffusion editing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2024.

In contrast to existing general-purpose model editing techniques, which unlearn concepts without considering the associated contexts, Moderator allows admins to specify what content should be moderated, under which context, how it should be moderated, and why moderation is necessary. Given a set of policies, Moderator first prompts the original model to generate images that need to be moderated, then uses these self-generated images to reverse fine-tune the model to compute task vectors for moderation and finally negates the original model with the task vectors to decrease its performance in generating moderated content. We evaluated Moderator with 14 participants to play the role of admins and found they could quickly learn and author policies to pass unit tests in approximately 2.29 policy iterations. Our experiment with 32 stable diffusion users suggested that Moderator can prevent 65% of users from generating moderated content under 15 attempts and require the remaining users an average of 8.3 times more attempts to generate undesired content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CCS 2024</p></details> |

One challenge facing drug discovery AI is that drug pharmacokinetic (PK) datasets are often collected independently from each other, often with limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Data sparsity makes data curation difficult for researchers looking to answer research questions in poly-pharmacy, drug combination research, and high-throughput screening. We propose Imagand, a novel SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetic (S2PK) diffusion model capable of generating an array of PK target properties conditioned on SMILES inputs. We show that Imagand-generated synthetic PK data closely resembles real data univariate and bivariate distributions, and improves performance for downstream tasks. Imagand is a promising solution for data overlap sparsity and allows researchers to efficiently generate ligand PK data for drug discovery research.

In this design, the camera lens is replaced by another optical element that interferes with the incoming light. The image is recovered from the raw sensor measurements using a reconstruction algorithm. Yet, the quality of the reconstructed images is not satisfactory. To mitigate this, we propose utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model with a control network and a learned separable transformation for reconstruction. This allows us to build a prototype flat camera with high-quality imaging, presenting state-of-the-art results in both terms of quality and perceptuality. We demonstrate its ability to leverage also textual descriptions of the captured scene to further enhance reconstruction. Our reconstruction method which leverages the strong capabilities of a pre-trained diffusion model can be used in other imaging systems for improved reconstruction results.</p></details> |  |

Despite the widespread application demand in editing human-centered videos, these models face significant challenges in handling complex objects like humans. In this paper, we introduce DeCo, a novel video editing framework specifically designed to treat humans and the background as separate editable targets, ensuring global spatial-temporal consistency by maintaining the coherence of each individual component. Specifically, we propose a decoupled dynamic human representation that utilizes a parametric human body prior to generate tailored humans while preserving the consistent motions as the original video. In addition, we consider the background as a layered atlas to apply text-guided image editing approaches on it. To further enhance the geometry and texture of humans during the optimization, we extend the calculation of score distillation sampling into normal space and image space. Moreover, we tackle inconsistent lighting between the edited targets by leveraging a lighting-aware video harmonizer, a problem previously overlooked in decompose-edit-combine approaches. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments demonstrate that DeCo outperforms prior video editing methods in human-centered videos, especially in longer videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Conference on Computer Vision</p></details> |

However, these approaches typically require tens or even hundreds of iterative samplings, resulting in significant latency. Recently, techniques have been devised to enhance the sampling efficiency of diffusion-based SR models via knowledge distillation. Nonetheless, when aligning the knowledge of student and teacher models, these solutions either solely rely on pixel-level loss constraints or neglect the fact that diffusion models prioritize varying levels of information at different time steps. To accomplish effective and efficient image super-resolution, we propose a time-aware diffusion distillation method, named TAD-SR. Specifically, we introduce a novel score distillation strategy to align the data distribution between the outputs of the student and teacher models after minor noise perturbation. This distillation strategy enables the student network to concentrate more on the high-frequency details. Furthermore, to mitigate performance limitations stemming from distillation, we integrate a latent adversarial loss and devise a time-aware discriminator that leverages diffusion priors to effectively distinguish between real images and generated images. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to both previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and the teacher model in just one sampling step.

The algorithm is rooted in Bayesian posterior sampling: it combines a likelihood model enforcing fidelity to the reverberant measurement, and an anechoic speech prior implemented by an unconditional diffusion model. We design a parametric filter representing the RIR, with exponential decay for each frequency subband. Room acoustics estimation and speech dereverberation are jointly carried out, as the filter parameters are iteratively estimated and the speech utterance refined along the reverse diffusion trajectory. In a blind scenario where the room impulse response is unknown, BUDDy successfully performs speech dereverberation in various acoustic scenarios, significantly outperforming other blind unsupervised baselines. Unlike supervised methods, which often struggle to generalize, BUDDy seamlessly adapts to different acoustic conditions. This paper extends our previous work by offering new experimental results and insights into the algorithm's performance and versatility. We first investigate the robustness of informed dereverberation methods to RIR estimation errors, to motivate the joint acoustic estimation and dereverberation paradigm. Then, we demonstrate the adaptability of our method to high-resolution singing voice dereverberation, study its performance in RIR estimation, and conduct subjective evaluation experiments to validate the perceptual quality of the results, among other contributions.

However, pre-trained models may not always be optimal, especially when there are discrepancies between training tasks and target tasks, potentially resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we introduce \textbf{KIND}, which performs \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{IN}tegration and \textbf{D}iversion in diffusion models. KIND first integrates knowledge by decomposing parameter matrices of models using $U$, $\Sigma$, and $V$ matrices, formally inspired by singular value decomposition (SVD). Then it explicitly partitions the components of these matrices into \textbf{learngenes} and \textbf{tailors} to condense common and class-specific knowledge, respectively, through a class gate. In this way, KIND redefines traditional pre-training methods by adjusting training objectives from maximizing model performance on current tasks to condensing transferable common knowledge, leveraging the \textit{Learngene} framework. We conduct experiments on ImageNet-1K and compare KIND with PEFT and other learngene methods. Results indicate that KIND achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other PEFT and learngene methods. Specifically, the images generated by KIND achieves more than 6.54 and 1.07 decrease in FID and sFID on DiT-L/2, utilizing only 45.4M trainable parameters and saving at least 35.4G FLOPs in computational cost.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), which offer realism but suffer from instability and lack uncertainty estimation. Even though both GAN and DM methods have individually exhibited their capability in medical image translation tasks, the potential of combining a GAN and DM to further improve translation performance and to enable uncertainty estimation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a Cascade Multi-path Shortcut Diffusion Model (CMDM) for high-quality medical image translation and uncertainty estimation. To reduce the required number of iterations and ensure robust performance, our method first obtains a conditional GAN-generated prior image that will be used for the efficient reverse translation with a DM in the subsequent step. Additionally, a multi-path shortcut diffusion strategy is employed to refine translation results and estimate uncertainty. A cascaded pipeline further enhances translation quality, incorporating residual averaging between cascades. We collected three different medical image datasets with two sub-tasks for each dataset to test the generalizability of our approach. Our experimental results found that CMDM can produce high-quality translations comparable to state-of-the-art methods while providing reasonable uncertainty estimations that correlate well with the translation error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Medical Image Analysis Journal</p></details> |

The appropriate selection of a font can significantly enhance artwork and endow advertisements with a higher level of expressivity. Despite the availability of numerous diverse font designs online, traditional retrieval-based methods for font selection are increasingly being supplanted by generation-based approaches. These newer methods offer enhanced flexibility, catering to specific user preferences and capturing unique stylistic impressions. However, current impression font techniques based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) necessitate the utilization of multiple auxiliary losses to provide guidance during generation. Furthermore, these methods commonly employ weighted summation for the fusion of impression-related keywords. This leads to generic vectors with the addition of more impression keywords, ultimately lacking in detail generation capacity. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based method, termed \ourmethod, to generate fonts that vividly embody specific impressions, utilizing an input consisting of a single letter and a set of descriptive impression keywords. The core innovation of \ourmethod lies in the development of dual cross-attention modules, which process the characteristics of the letters and impression keywords independently but synergistically, ensuring effective integration of both types of information. Our experimental results, conducted on the MyFonts dataset, affirm that this method is capable of producing realistic, vibrant, and high-fidelity fonts that are closely aligned with user specifications. This confirms the potential of our approach to revolutionize font generation by accommodating a broad spectrum of user-driven design requirements.

Recently, the combination of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with latent diffusion models (LDMs) has emerged as a viable approach for efficiently adapting pre-trained large language models, in the medical field. However, the direct application of LoRA assumes uniform ranking across all linear layers, overlooking the significance of different weight matrices, and leading to sub-optimal outcomes. Prior works on LoRA prioritize the reduction of trainable parameters, and there exists an opportunity to further tailor this adaptation process to the intricate demands of medical image synthesis. In response, we present SeLoRA, a Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation Module, that dynamically expands its ranking across layers during training, strategically placing additional ranks on crucial layers, to allow the model to elevate synthesis quality where it matters most. The proposed method not only enables LDMs to fine-tune on medical data efficiently but also empowers the model to achieve improved image quality with minimal ranking.

These models typically exhibit high computational and memory demands, necessitating effective post-training quantization for high-performance inference. Recent works propose low-bitwidth (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit) quantization for diffusion models, however 4-bit integer quantization typically results in low-quality images. We observe that on several widely used hardware platforms, there is little or no difference in compute capability between floating-point and integer arithmetic operations of the same bitwidth (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit). Therefore, we propose an effective floating-point quantization method for diffusion models that provides better image quality compared to integer quantization methods. We employ a floating-point quantization method that was effective for other processing tasks, specifically computer vision and natural language tasks, and tailor it for diffusion models by integrating weight rounding learning during the mapping of the full-precision values to the quantized values in the quantization process. We comprehensively study integer and floating-point quantization methods in state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our floating-point quantization method not only generates higher-quality images than that of integer quantization methods, but also shows no noticeable degradation compared to full-precision models (32-bit floating-point), when both weights and activations are quantized to 8-bit floating-point values, while has minimal degradation with 4-bit weights and 8-bit activations.</p></details> |  |

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) are the main frameworks used to create Deepfakes, producing highly realistic yet fabricated content. While these technologies open up new creative possibilities, they also bring substantial ethical and security risks due to their potential misuse. The rise of such advanced media has led to the development of a cognitive bias known as Impostor Bias, where individuals doubt the authenticity of multimedia due to the awareness of AI's capabilities. As a result, Deepfake detection has become a vital area of research, focusing on identifying subtle inconsistencies and artifacts with machine learning techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Research in forensic Deepfake technology encompasses five main areas: detection, attribution and recognition, passive authentication, detection in realistic scenarios, and active authentication.

| **[An Ensemble Score Filter for Tracking High-Dimensional Nonlinear Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00983v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an ensemble score filter (EnSF) for solving high-dimensional nonlinear filtering problems with superior accuracy. A major drawback of existing filtering methods, e.g., particle filters or ensemble Kalman filters, is the low accuracy in handling high-dimensional and highly nonlinear problems. EnSF attacks this challenge by exploiting the score-based diffusion model, defined in a pseudo-temporal domain, to characterizing the evolution of the filtering density. EnSF stores the information of the recursively updated filtering density function in the score function, instead of storing the information in a set of finite Monte Carlo samples (used in particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters). Unlike existing diffusion models that train neural networks to approximate the score function, we develop a training-free score estimation that uses a mini-batch-based Monte Carlo estimator to directly approximate the score function at any pseudo-spatial-temporal location, which provides sufficient accuracy in solving high-dimensional nonlinear problems as well as saves a tremendous amount of time spent on training neural networks. High-dimensional Lorenz-96 systems are used to demonstrate the performance of our method. EnSF provides surprising performance, compared with the state-of-the-art Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter method, in reliably and efficiently tracking extremely high-dimensional Lorenz systems (up to 1,000,000 dimensions) with highly nonlinear observation processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.09282</p></details> |

A significant challenge with slate recommendation is managing the complex combinatorial choice space. Traditional methods often simplify this problem by assuming users engage with only one item at a time. However, this simplification does not reflect the reality, as users often interact with multiple items simultaneously. In this paper, we address the general slate recommendation problem, which accounts for simultaneous engagement with multiple items. We propose a generative approach using Diffusion Models, leveraging their ability to learn structures in high-dimensional data. Our model generates high-quality slates that maximize user satisfaction by overcoming the challenges of the combinatorial choice space. Furthermore, our approach enhances the diversity of recommendations. Extensive offline evaluations on applications such as music playlist generation and e-commerce bundle recommendations show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both relevance and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we propose CLIP4Sketch, a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate a large and diverse set of sketch images, which helps in enhancing the performance of face recognition systems in sketch-to-mugshot matching. Our method utilizes Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate sketches with explicit control over identity and style. We combine CLIP and Adaface embeddings of a reference mugshot, along with textual descriptions of style, as the conditions to the diffusion model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating a comprehensive dataset of sketches corresponding to mugshots and training a face recognition model on our synthetic data. Our results show significant improvements in sketch-to-mugshot matching accuracy over training on an existing, limited amount of real face sketch data, validating the potential of diffusion models in enhancing the performance of face recognition systems across modalities. We also compare our dataset with datasets generated using GAN-based methods to show its superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffSG: A Generative Solver for Network Optimization with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06701v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion generative models, famous for their performance in image generation, are popular in various cross-domain applications. However, their use in the communication community has been mostly limited to auxiliary tasks like data modeling and feature extraction. These models hold greater promise for fundamental problems in network optimization compared to traditional machine learning methods. Discriminative deep learning often falls short due to its single-step input-output mapping and lack of global awareness of the solution space, especially given the complexity of network optimization's objective functions. In contrast, diffusion generative models can consider a broader range of solutions and exhibit stronger generalization by learning parameters that describe the distribution of the underlying solution space, with higher probabilities assigned to better solutions. We propose a new framework Diffusion Model-based Solution Generation (DiffSG), which leverages the intrinsic distribution learning capabilities of diffusion generative models to learn high-quality solution distributions based on given inputs. The optimal solution within this distribution is highly probable, allowing it to be effectively reached through repeated sampling. We validate the performance of DiffSG on several typical network optimization problems, including mixed-integer non-linear programming, convex optimization, and hierarchical non-convex optimization. Our results show that DiffSG outperforms existing baselines. In summary, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion generative models in tackling complex network optimization problems and outline a promising path for their broader application in the communication community.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Leveraging the density estimates from these models, our approach, the Diffusion Classifier for 3D Objects (DC3DO), enables zero-shot classification of 3D shapes without additional training. On average, our method achieves a 12.5 percent improvement compared to its multiview counterparts, demonstrating superior multimodal reasoning over discriminative approaches. DC3DO employs a class-conditional diffusion model trained on ShapeNet, and we run inferences on point clouds of chairs and cars.

| **[FreeDiff: Progressive Frequency Truncation for Image Editing with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11895v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise image editing with text-to-image models has attracted increasing interest due to their remarkable generative capabilities and user-friendly nature. However, such attempts face the pivotal challenge of misalignment between the intended precise editing target regions and the broader area impacted by the guidance in practice. Despite excellent methods leveraging attention mechanisms that have been developed to refine the editing guidance, these approaches necessitate modifications through complex network architecture and are limited to specific editing tasks. In this work, we re-examine the diffusion process and misalignment problem from a frequency perspective, revealing that, due to the power law of natural images and the decaying noise schedule, the denoising network primarily recovers low-frequency image components during the earlier timesteps and thus brings excessive low-frequency signals for editing. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel fine-tuning free approach that employs progressive $\textbf{Fre}$qu$\textbf{e}$ncy truncation to refine the guidance of $\textbf{Diff}$usion models for universal editing tasks ($\textbf{FreeDiff}$). Our method achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art methods across a variety of editing tasks and on a diverse set of images, highlighting its potential as a versatile tool in image editing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV-2024</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach for time series generation, emphasizing diverse synthesis scenarios based on historical or correlated time series data streams. Since time series have unique characteristics, such as fixed time order and data scaling, standard Gaussian prior might be ill-suited for general time series generation. In this paper, we exploit the usage of diverse prior distributions for synthesis. Then, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that enables flexible synthesis by leveraging diffusion bridges to learn the transport between chosen prior and data distributions. Our model covers a wide range of scenarios in time series diffusion models, which leverages (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional synthesis, and (ii) data-scale preserving synthesis with a constraint as a prior for conditional generation. Experimentally, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both unconditional and conditional time series generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid SD: Edge-Cloud Collaborative Inference for Stable Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06646v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stable Diffusion Models (SDMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in image synthesis. However, their broad application is impeded by their large model sizes and intensive computational requirements, which typically require expensive cloud servers for deployment. On the flip side, while there are many compact models tailored for edge devices that can reduce these demands, they often compromise on semantic integrity and visual quality when compared to full-sized SDMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hybrid SD, an innovative, training-free SDMs inference framework designed for edge-cloud collaborative inference. Hybrid SD distributes the early steps of the diffusion process to the large models deployed on cloud servers, enhancing semantic planning. Furthermore, small efficient models deployed on edge devices can be integrated for refining visual details in the later stages. Acknowledging the diversity of edge devices with differing computational and storage capacities, we employ structural pruning to the SDMs U-Net and train a lightweight VAE. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our compressed models achieve state-of-the-art parameter efficiency (225.8M) on edge devices with competitive image quality. Additionally, Hybrid SD reduces the cloud cost by 66% with edge-cloud collaborative inference.</p></details> |  |

To scale up the training data for the diffusion model, a lightweight network is developed to efficiently acquire feature volumes from multi-view images. The 3D volumes are then trained on a diffusion model for text-to-3D generation using a 3D U-Net. This research further addresses the challenges of inaccurate object captions and high-dimensional feature volumes. The proposed model, trained on the public Objaverse dataset, demonstrates promising outcomes in producing diverse and recognizable samples from text prompts. Notably, it empowers finer control over object part characteristics through textual cues, fostering model creativity by seamlessly combining multiple concepts within a single object.

Most existing motion generation methods predominantly rely on manually collected motion datasets, usually tediously sourced from motion capture (Mocap) systems or Multi-View cameras, unavoidably resulting in a limited size that severely undermines their generalizability. Inspired by recent advance of diffusion models, we probe a simple and effective way to capture motions from videos and propose a novel Video-to-Motion-Generation framework (ViMo) which could leverage the immense trove of untapped video content to produce abundant and diverse 3D human motions. Distinct from prior work, our videos could be more causal, including complicated camera movements and occlusions. Striking experimental results demonstrate the proposed model could generate natural motions even for videos where rapid movements, varying perspectives, or frequent occlusions might exist. We also show this work could enable three important downstream applications, such as generating dancing motions according to arbitrary music and source video style. Extensive experimental results prove that our model offers an effective and scalable way to generate diversity and realistic motions. Code and demos will be public soon.</p></details> |  |

PeRFlow divides the sampling process of generative flows into several time windows and straightens the trajectories in each interval via the reflow operation, thereby approaching piecewise linear flows. PeRFlow achieves superior performance in a few-step generation. Moreover, through dedicated parameterizations, the PeRFlow models inherit knowledge from the pretrained diffusion models. Thus, the training converges fast and the obtained models show advantageous transfer ability, serving as universal plug-and-play accelerators that are compatible with various workflows based on the pre-trained diffusion models.

| **[Unified Discrete Diffusion for Categorical Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03701v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have seen a surge of attention with applications on naturally discrete data such as language and graphs. Although discrete-time discrete diffusion has been established for a while, only recently Campbell et al. (2022) introduced the first framework for continuous-time discrete diffusion. However, their training and sampling processes differ significantly from the discrete-time version, necessitating nontrivial approximations for tractability. In this paper, we first present a series of mathematical simplifications of the variational lower bound that enable more accurate and easy-to-optimize training for discrete diffusion. In addition, we derive a simple formulation for backward denoising that enables exact and accelerated sampling, and importantly, an elegant unification of discrete-time and continuous-time discrete diffusion. Thanks to simpler analytical formulations, both forward and now also backward probabilities can flexibly accommodate any noise distribution, including different noise distributions for multi-element objects. Experiments show that our proposed USD3 (for Unified Simplified Discrete Denoising Diffusion) outperform all SOTA baselines on established datasets. We open-source our unified code at https://github.com/LingxiaoShawn/USD3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Unify...</summary><p>Unify Discrete Denoising Diffusion</p></details> |

However, these techniques often fall short when predicting the structures of protein complexes (PCs), which involve multiple proteins. In our study, we investigate using atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with deep learning to predict the 3D structures of PCs. AFM generates height maps that depict the PCs in various random orientations, providing a rich information for training a neural network to predict the 3D structures. We then employ the pre-trained UpFusion model (which utilizes a conditional diffusion model for synthesizing novel views) to train an instance-specific NeRF model for 3D reconstruction. The performance of UpFusion is evaluated through zero-shot predictions of 3D protein structures using AFM images. The challenge, however, lies in the time-intensive and impractical nature of collecting actual AFM images. To address this, we use a virtual AFM imaging process that transforms a `PDB' protein file into multi-view 2D virtual AFM images via volume rendering techniques. We extensively validate the UpFusion architecture using both virtual and actual multi-view AFM images. Our results include a comparison of structures predicted with varying numbers of views and different sets of views. This novel approach holds significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of protein complex structure predictions with further fine-tuning of the UpFusion network.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to address the problems of societal bias in CLIP. Although previous studies have proposed to debias societal bias through adversarial learning or test-time projecting, our comprehensive study of these works identifies two critical limitations: 1) loss of attribute information when it is explicitly disclosed in the input and 2) use of the attribute annotations during debiasing process. To mitigate societal bias in CLIP and overcome these limitations simultaneously, we introduce a simple-yet-effective debiasing method called SANER (societal attribute neutralizer) that eliminates attribute information from CLIP text features only of attribute-neutral descriptions. Experimental results show that SANER, which does not require attribute annotations and preserves original information for attribute-specific descriptions, demonstrates superior debiasing ability than the existing methods.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LongVILA, a full-stack solution for long-context vision-language models, including system, model training, and dataset development. On the system side, we introduce the first Multi-Modal Sequence Parallelism (MM-SP) system that enables long-context training and inference, enabling 2M context length training on 256 GPUs. MM-SP is also efficient, being 2.1x - 5.7x faster than Ring-Style Sequence Parallelism and 1.1x - 1.4x faster than Megatron-LM in text-only settings. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with Hugging Face Transformers. For model training, we propose a five-stage pipeline comprising alignment, pre-training, context extension, and long-short joint supervised fine-tuning. Regarding datasets, we meticulously construct large-scale visual language pre-training datasets and long video instruction-following datasets to support our multi-stage training process. The full-stack solution extends the feasible frame number of VILA by a factor of 128 (from 8 to 1024 frames) and improves long video captioning score from 2.00 to 3.26 (1.6x), achieving 99.5% accuracy in 1400-frames video (274k context length) needle in a haystack. LongVILA-8B also demonstrates a consistent improvement in performance on long videos within the VideoMME benchmark as the video frames increase.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are available at https://github.com/NVlabs/VILA/blob/main/LongVILA.md</p></details> |

However, their performance significantly degrades when test inputs exhibit different distributions. In this paper, we explore the concept of test-time prompt tuning (TTPT), which facilitates the adaptation of the CLIP model to novel downstream tasks through a one-step unsupervised optimization that involves only test samples. Inspired by in-context learning in natural language processing (NLP), we propose In-Context Prompt Learning (InCPL) for test-time visual recognition tasks, which empowers a pre-trained vision-language model with labeled examples as context information on downstream task. Specifically, InCPL associates a new test sample with very few labeled examples (sometimes just one) as context information, enabling reliable label estimation for the test sample and facilitating model adaptation. To achieve this, InCPL employs an efficient language-to-vision translator to explore the textual prior information for visual prompt learning. Further, we introduce a context-aware unsupervised loss to optimize visual prompts tailored to test samples. Finally, we design a cyclic learning strategy for visual and textual prompts to ensure mutual synergy across different modalities. This enables a pre-trained, frozen CLIP model to adapt to any task using its learned adaptive prompt. Our method demonstrates superior performance and achieves state-of-the-art results across various downstream datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Phantom Menace: Unmasking Privacy Leakages in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01228v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual and textual understanding, rendering them well-suited for diverse tasks like generating image captions and answering visual questions across various domains. However, these capabilities are built upon training on large amount of uncurated data crawled from the web. The latter may include sensitive information that VLMs could memorize and leak, raising significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we assess whether these vulnerabilities exist, focusing on identity leakage. Our study leads to three key findings: (i) VLMs leak identity information, even when the vision-language alignment and the fine-tuning use anonymized data; (ii) context has little influence on identity leakage; (iii) simple, widely used anonymization techniques, like blurring, are not sufficient to address the problem. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust privacy protection strategies when deploying VLMs. Ethical awareness and responsible development practices are essential to mitigate these risks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution: leveraging intra-domain category-aware prototypes for ODCL in CLIP (DPeCLIP), where the prototype is the key to bridging the above two processes. Concretely, we propose a training-free Task-ID discriminator method, by utilizing prototypes as classifiers for identifying Task-IDs. Furthermore, to maintain the knowledge corresponding to each domain, we incorporate intra-domain category-aware prototypes as domain prior prompts into the training process. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 2.37% and 1.14% average improvement in class-incremental and task-incremental settings, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Recent research discovered that the mid-layer representation of the subject's final token in a prompt has a strong influence on factual predictions, and developed Large Language Model (LLM) editing techniques based on this observation. However, for Vision-LLMs (VLLMs), how visual representations impact the predictions from a decoder-only language model remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, model editing for VLLMs has not been extensively studied in the literature. In this work, we employ the contribution allocation and noise perturbation methods to measure the contributions of visual representations for token predictions. Our attribution analysis shows that visual representations in mid-to-later layers that are highly relevant to the prompt contribute significantly to predictions. Based on these insights, we propose VisEdit, a novel model editor for VLLMs that effectively corrects knowledge by editing intermediate visual representations in regions important to the edit prompt. We evaluated VisEdit using multiple VLLM backbones and public VLLM editing benchmark datasets. The results show the superiority of VisEdit over the strong baselines adapted from existing state-of-the-art editors for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, presenting considerable security risks. This paper introduces Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), a novel technique to enhance the adversarial robustness of image encoders in VLMs. AdvPT innovatively leverages learnable text prompts and aligns them with adversarial image embeddings, to address the vulnerabilities inherent in VLMs without the need for extensive parameter training or modification of the model architecture. We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research. These findings open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiamingzhang94/Adversarial-Prompt-Tuning.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

However, due to the feature divergence of an attribute (resp. object) when combined with different objects (resp. attributes), it is challenging to learn disentangled primitive features that are general across different compositions. To this end, we propose the solution of cross-composition feature disentanglement, which takes multiple primitive-sharing compositions as inputs and constrains the disentangled primitive features to be general across these compositions. More specifically, we leverage a compositional graph to define the overall primitive-sharing relationships between compositions, and build a task-specific architecture upon the recently successful large pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) CLIP, with dual cross-composition disentangling adapters (called L-Adapter and V-Adapter) inserted into CLIP's frozen text and image encoders, respectively. Evaluation on three popular CZSL benchmarks shows that our proposed solution significantly improves the performance of CZSL, and its components have been verified by solid ablation studies.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, existing prompt tuning methods typically map an image to a single representation, limiting the model's ability to capture the diverse ways an image can be described. To address this limitation, we investigate the impact of visual prompts on the model's generalization capability and introduce a novel method termed Multi-Representation Guided Prompt Tuning (MePT). Specifically, MePT employs a three-branch framework that focuses on diverse salient regions, uncovering the inherent knowledge within images which is crucial for robust generalization. Further, we employ efficient self-ensemble techniques to integrate these versatile image representations, allowing MePT to learn all conditional, marginal, and fine-grained distributions effectively. We validate the effectiveness of MePT through extensive experiments, demonstrating significant improvements on both base-to-novel class prediction and domain generalization tasks.</p></details> |  |

This system analyzes videos of humans performing tasks and outputs executable robot programs that incorporate insights into affordances. The process begins with GPT-4V analyzing the videos to obtain textual explanations of environmental and action details. A GPT-4-based task planner then encodes these details into a symbolic task plan. Subsequently, vision systems spatially and temporally ground the task plan in the videos. Object are identified using an open-vocabulary object detector, and hand-object interactions are analyzed to pinpoint moments of grasping and releasing. This spatiotemporal grounding allows for the gathering of affordance information (e.g., grasp types, waypoints, and body postures) critical for robot execution. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate the method's efficacy in achieving real robots' operations from human demonstrations in a one-shot manner. Meanwhile, quantitative tests have revealed instances of hallucination in GPT-4V, highlighting the importance of incorporating human supervision within the pipeline.

Recent studies has demonstrated that the large vision-language model can enhance the performance of various downstream tasks in medical image understanding. In this study, we developed a domain-specific large language-vision assistant (PA-LLaVA) for pathology image understanding. Specifically, (1) we first construct a human pathology image-text dataset by cleaning the public medical image-text data for domain-specific alignment; (2) Using the proposed image-text data, we first train a pathology language-image pretraining (PLIP) model as the specialized visual encoder for pathology image, and then we developed scale-invariant connector to avoid the information loss caused by image scaling; (3) We adopt two-stage learning to train PA-LLaVA, first stage for domain alignment, and second stage for end to end visual question \& answering (VQA) task.

The advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) with advanced image-processing capabilities introduces new risks, as these models can inadvertently reveal sensitive geolocation information. This paper presents the first in-depth study analyzing the challenges posed by traditional deep learning and LVLM-based geolocation methods. Our findings reveal that LVLMs can accurately determine geolocations from images, even without explicit geographic training. To address these challenges, we introduce \tool{}, an innovative framework that significantly enhances image-based geolocation accuracy. \tool{} employs a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) approach, mimicking human geoguessing strategies by carefully analyzing visual and contextual cues such as vehicle types, architectural styles, natural landscapes, and cultural elements. Extensive testing on a dataset of 50,000 ground-truth data points shows that \tool{} outperforms both traditional models and human benchmarks in accuracy. It achieves an impressive average score of 4550.5 in the GeoGuessr game, with an 85.37\% win rate, and delivers highly precise geolocation predictions, with the closest distances as accurate as 0.3 km. Furthermore, our study highlights issues related to dataset integrity, leading to the creation of a more robust dataset and a refined framework that leverages LVLMs' cognitive capabilities to improve geolocation precision. These findings underscore \tool{}'s superior ability to interpret complex visual data, the urgent need to address emerging security vulnerabilities posed by LVLMs, and the importance of responsible AI development to ensure user privacy protection.</p></details> |  |

While VLMs perform well in simple single-person scenarios, in real-world applications, we often face complex situations in which there are persons of different genders doing different activities. We show that in such cases, VLMs are biased towards identifying the individual with the expected gender (according to ingrained gender stereotypes in the model or other forms of sample selection bias) as the performer of the activity. We refer to this bias in associating an activity with the gender of its actual performer in an image or text as the Gender-Activity Binding (GAB) bias and analyze how this bias is internalized in VLMs. To assess this bias, we have introduced the GAB dataset with approximately 5500 AI-generated images that represent a variety of activities, addressing the scarcity of real-world images for some scenarios. To have extensive quality control, the generated images are evaluated for their diversity, quality, and realism. We have tested 12 renowned pre-trained VLMs on this dataset in the context of text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval to measure the effect of this bias on their predictions. Additionally, we have carried out supplementary experiments to quantify the bias in VLMs' text encoders and to evaluate VLMs' capability to recognize activities. Our experiments indicate that VLMs experience an average performance decline of about 13.2% when confronted with gender-activity binding bias.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces V2X-VLM, an innovative E2E vehicle-infrastructure cooperative autonomous driving (VICAD) framework with large vision-language models (VLMs). V2X-VLM is designed to enhance situational awareness, decision-making, and ultimate trajectory planning by integrating data from vehicle-mounted cameras, infrastructure sensors, and textual information. The strength of the comprehensive multimodel data fusion of the VLM enables precise and safe E2E trajectory planning in complex and dynamic driving scenarios.

However, adapting these models to new domains remains challenging, especially in unsupervised settings where labelled data is unavailable. Recent research has proposed pseudo-labelling approaches to adapt CLIP in an unsupervised manner using unlabelled target data. Nonetheless, these methods struggle due to noisy pseudo-labels resulting from the misalignment between CLIP's visual and textual representations. This study introduces DPA, an unsupervised domain adaptation method for VLMs. DPA introduces the concept of dual prototypes, acting as distinct classifiers, along with the convex combination of their outputs, thereby leading to accurate pseudo-label construction. Next, it ranks pseudo-labels to facilitate robust self-training, particularly during early training. Finally, it addresses visual-textual misalignment by aligning textual prototypes with image prototypes to further improve the adaptation performance. Experiments on 13 downstream vision tasks demonstrate that DPA significantly outperforms zero-shot CLIP and the state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Skill Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15019v2)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-conditioned robotic skills make it possible to apply the high-level reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) to low-level robotic control. A remaining challenge is to acquire a diverse set of fundamental skills. Existing approaches either manually decompose a complex task into atomic robotic actions in a top-down fashion, or bootstrap as many combinations as possible in a bottom-up fashion to cover a wider range of task possibilities. These decompositions or combinations, however, require an initial skill library. For example, a ``grasping'' capability can never emerge from a skill library containing only diverse ``pushing'' skills. Existing skill discovery techniques with reinforcement learning acquire skills by an exhaustive exploration but often yield non-meaningful behaviors. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for skill discovery that is entirely driven by LLMs. The framework begins with an LLM generating task proposals based on the provided scene description and the robot's configurations, aiming to incrementally acquire new skills upon task completion. For each proposed task, a series of reinforcement learning processes are initiated, utilizing reward and success determination functions sampled by the LLM to develop the corresponding policy. The reliability and trustworthiness of learned behaviors are further ensured by an independent vision-language model. We show that starting with zero skill, the skill library emerges and expands to more and more meaningful and reliable skills, enabling the robot to efficiently further propose and complete advanced tasks.

However, their performance and reliability in specialized domains such as medicine remain insufficiently assessed. In particular, most assessments over-concentrate in evaluating VLMs based on simple Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-modality data, while ignoring the in-depth characteristic of LVLMs. In this study, we introduce RadVUQA, a novel Radiological Visual Understanding and Question Answering benchmark, to comprehensively evaluate existing LVLMs. RadVUQA mainly validates LVLMs across five dimensions: 1) Anatomical understanding, assessing the models' ability to visually identify biological structures; 2) Multimodal comprehension, which involves the capability of interpreting linguistic and visual instructions to produce desired outcomes; 3) Quantitative and spatial reasoning, evaluating the models' spatial awareness and proficiency in combining quantitative analysis with visual and linguistic information; 4) Physiological knowledge, measuring the models' capability to comprehend functions and mechanisms of organs and systems; and 5) Robustness, which assesses the models' capabilities against unharmonised and synthetic data. The results indicate that both generalized LVLMs and medical-specific LVLMs have critical deficiencies with weak multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal the large gap between existing LVLMs and clinicians, highlighting the urgent need for more robust and intelligent LVLMs. The code and dataset will be available after the acceptance of this paper.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Existing TPR methods primarily focus on recognizing explicit and positive characteristics, often overlooking the role of negative descriptions. This oversight can lead to false positives-images that meet positive criteria but should be excluded based on negative descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce DualFocus, a unified framework that integrates plausible descriptions to enhance the interpretative accuracy of vision-language models in TPR tasks. DualFocus leverages Dual (Positive/Negative) Attribute Prompt Learning (DAPL), which incorporates Dual Image-Attribute Contrastive (DIAC) Learning and Sensitive Image-Attributes Matching (SIAM) Learning, enabling the detection of non-existent attributes and reducing false positives. To achieve a balance between coarse and fine-grained alignment of visual and textual embeddings, we propose the Dynamic Tokenwise Similarity (DTS) loss, which refines the representation of both matching and non-matching descriptions, thereby improving the matching process through detailed and adaptable similarity assessments. The comprehensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, DualFocus demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing both precision and robustness in TPR.</p></details> |  |

These methods typically find concept activation vectors (CAVs) using a probe dataset of concept examples. This requires labelled data for these concepts -- an expensive task in the medical domain. We introduce TextCAVs: a novel method which creates CAVs using vision-language models such as CLIP, allowing for explanations to be created solely using text descriptions of the concept, as opposed to image exemplars. This reduced cost in testing concepts allows for many concepts to be tested and for users to interact with the model, testing new ideas as they are thought of, rather than a delay caused by image collection and annotation. In early experimental results, we demonstrate that TextCAVs produces reasonable explanations for a chest x-ray dataset (MIMIC-CXR) and natural images (ImageNet), and that these explanations can be used to debug deep learning-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures.

However, VLMs face significant security challenges, such as jailbreak attacks, where attackers attempt to bypass the model's safety alignment to elicit harmful responses. The threat of jailbreak attacks on VLMs arises from both the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs and the multiple information channels that VLMs process. While various attacks and defenses have been proposed, there is a notable gap in unified and comprehensive evaluations, as each method is evaluated on different dataset and metrics, making it impossible to compare the effectiveness of each method. To address this gap, we introduce \textit{MMJ-Bench}, a unified pipeline for evaluating jailbreak attacks and defense techniques for VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we assess the effectiveness of various attack methods against SoTA VLMs and evaluate the impact of defense mechanisms on both defense effectiveness and model utility for normal tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation contribute to the field by offering a unified and systematic evaluation framework and the first public-available benchmark for VLM jailbreak research. We also demonstrate several insightful findings that highlights directions for future studies.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancement, many current approaches prioritize short-term gains at expense of long-term effectiveness. This paper critiques the overly specialized approach of fine-tuning pre-trained models solely with a penny-wise objective on a single deepfake dataset, while disregarding the pound-wise balance for generalization and knowledge retention. To address this "Penny-Wise and Pound-Foolish" issue, we propose a novel learning framework (PoundNet) for generalization of deepfake detection on a pre-trained vision-language model. PoundNet incorporates a learnable prompt design and a balanced objective to preserve broad knowledge from upstream tasks (object classification) while enhancing generalization for downstream tasks (deepfake detection). We train PoundNet on a standard single deepfake dataset, following common practice in the literature. We then evaluate its performance across 10 public large-scale deepfake datasets with 5 main evaluation metrics-forming the largest benchmark test set for assessing the generalization ability of deepfake detection models, to our knowledge. The comprehensive benchmark evaluation demonstrates the proposed PoundNet is significantly less "Penny-Wise and Pound-Foolish", achieving a remarkable improvement of 19% in deepfake detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining a strong performance of 63% on object classification tasks, where other deepfake detection models tend to be ineffective.

Evaluating the effectiveness of these tutorials usually requires multiple iterations with testers who have no prior knowledge of the game. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in understanding and interpreting visual content. VLMs can analyze images, provide detailed insights, and answer questions about their content. They can recognize objects, actions, and contexts in visual data, making them valuable tools for various applications, including automated game testing. In this work, we propose an automated game-testing solution to evaluate the quality of game tutorials. Our approach leverages VLMs to analyze frames from video game tutorials, answer relevant questions to simulate human perception, and provide feedback. This feedback is compared with expected results to identify confusing or problematic scenes and highlight potential errors for developers. In addition, we publish complete tutorial videos and annotated frames from different game versions used in our tests. This solution reduces the need for extensive manual testing, especially by speeding up and simplifying the initial development stages of the tutorial to improve the final game experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024 CV2 Workshop</p></details> |

Given the complexity and interconnectedness of these tasks, it is crucial to have a flexible framework that can effectively address these tasks in a cohesive manner. In this work, we propose FleVRS, a single model that seamlessly integrates the above three aspects in standard and promptable visual relationship segmentation, and further possesses the capability for open-vocabulary segmentation to adapt to novel scenarios. FleVRS leverages the synergy between text and image modalities, to ground various types of relationships from images and use textual features from vision-language models to visual conceptual understanding. Empirical validation across various datasets demonstrates that our framework outperforms existing models in standard, promptable, and open-vocabulary tasks, e.g., +1.9 $mAP$ on HICO-DET, +11.4 $Acc$ on VRD, +4.7 $mAP$ on unseen HICO-DET. Our FleVRS represents a significant step towards a more intuitive, comprehensive, and scalable understanding of visual relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, the prevalent assumption of having an extensive pool of training data encompassing all classes prior to model training often diverges from real-world scenarios, where limited data availability for novel classes is the norm. The challenge emerges in seamlessly integrating new classes with few samples into the training data, demanding the model to adeptly accommodate these additions without compromising its performance on base classes. To address this exigency, the research community has introduced several solutions under the realm of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL). In this study, we introduce an innovative FSCIL framework that utilizes language regularizer and subspace regularizer. During base training, the language regularizer helps incorporate semantic information extracted from a Vision-Language model. The subspace regularizer helps in facilitating the model's acquisition of nuanced connections between image and text semantics inherent to base classes during incremental training. Our proposed framework not only empowers the model to embrace novel classes with limited data, but also ensures the preservation of performance on base classes. To substantiate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three distinct FSCIL benchmarks, where our framework attains state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Conventional methods rely on specialized architectures trained on specific datasets, which struggle to be adapted to new requirements. Recent breakthroughs in large vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled visual in-context learning without explicit training. However, effective strategies for vision downstream tasks with VLMs remain largely unclear and underexplored. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to leverage VLMs for better image cropping. First, we propose an efficient prompt retrieval mechanism for image cropping to automate the selection of in-context examples. Second, we introduce an iterative refinement strategy to iteratively enhance the predicted crops. The proposed framework, named Cropper, is applicable to a wide range of cropping tasks, including free-form cropping, subject-aware cropping, and aspect ratio-aware cropping. Extensive experiments and a user study demonstrate that Cropper significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This has led to the development of numerous prompting strategies to adapt transformer-based models without incurring catastrophic forgetting. However, these strategies often compromise the original zero-shot capabilities of the pre-trained CLIP model and struggle to adapt to domains that significantly deviate from the pre-training data. In this work, we propose Continual Generative training for Incremental prompt-Learning, a simple and novel approach to mitigate forgetting while adapting CLIP. Briefly, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn class-conditioned distributions within the embedding space of the visual encoder. We then exploit these distributions to sample new synthetic visual embeddings and train the corresponding class-specific textual prompts during subsequent tasks. Through extensive experiments on different domains, we show that such a generative replay approach can adapt to new tasks while improving zero-shot capabilities, evaluated using a novel metric tailored for CL scenarios. Notably, further analysis reveals that our approach can bridge the gap with joint prompt tuning.

To our knowledge, this is the first dataset for video ReID under Ground-to-Aerial scenarios. G2A-VReID dataset has the following characteristics: 1) Drastic view changes; 2) Large number of annotated identities; 3) Rich outdoor scenarios; 4) Huge difference in resolution. Additionally, we propose a new benchmark approach for cross-platform ReID by transforming the cross-platform visual alignment problem into visual-semantic alignment through vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) and applying a parameter-efficient Video Set-Level-Adapter module to adapt image-based foundation model to video ReID tasks, termed VSLA-CLIP. Besides, to further reduce the great discrepancy across the platforms, we also devise the platform-bridge prompts for efficient visual feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on all existing video ReID datasets and our proposed G2A-VReID dataset.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has studied different ways of automatically creating descriptor sets for every class based on prompt templates, ranging from manually engineered templates over templates obtained from a large language model to templates built from random words and characters. Up until now, deriving zero-shot classifiers from the respective encoded class descriptors has remained nearly unchanged, i.e., classify to the class that maximizes cosine similarity between its averaged encoded class descriptors and the image encoding. However, weighing all class descriptors equally can be suboptimal when certain descriptors match visual clues on a given image better than others. In this work, we propose AutoCLIP, a method for auto-tuning zero-shot classifiers. AutoCLIP tunes per-image weights to each prompt template at inference time, based on statistics of class descriptor-image similarities. AutoCLIP is fully unsupervised, has only a minor additional computation overhead, and can be easily implemented in few lines of code. We show that AutoCLIP outperforms baselines across a broad range of vision-language models, datasets, and prompt templates consistently and by up to 3 percent point accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at TMLR, Camera Ready Version</p></details> |

While object detection models have shown the capability to address this issue by identifying safety items, most existing models, such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and SSD, are limited in verifying the fine-grained attributes of PPE across diverse workplace scenarios. Vision language models (VLMs) are gaining traction for detection tasks by leveraging the synergy between visual and textual information, offering a promising solution to traditional object detection limitations in PPE recognition. Nonetheless, VLMs face challenges in consistently verifying PPE attributes due to the complexity and variability of workplace environments, requiring them to interpret context-specific language and visual cues simultaneously. We introduce Clip2Safety, an interpretable detection framework for diverse workplace safety compliance, which comprises four main modules: scene recognition, the visual prompt, safety items detection, and fine-grained verification. The scene recognition identifies the current scenario to determine the necessary safety gear. The visual prompt formulates the specific visual prompts needed for the detection process. The safety items detection identifies whether the required safety gear is being worn according to the specified scenario. Lastly, the fine-grained verification assesses whether the worn safety equipment meets the fine-grained attribute requirements. We conduct real-world case studies across six different scenarios. The results show that Clip2Safety not only demonstrates an accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art question-answering based VLMs but also achieves inference times two hundred times faster.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

However, it is unclear if these models are robust to distribution shifts, and how their performance and generalization capabilities vary under changes in data distribution. In this project we strive to answer the question "Are vision-language foundational models robust to distribution shifts like human perception?" Specifically, we consider a diverse range of vision-language models and compare how the performance of these systems is affected by corruption based distribution shifts (such as \textit{motion blur, fog, snow, gaussian noise}) commonly found in practical real-world scenarios. We analyse the generalization capabilities qualitatively and quantitatively on zero-shot image classification task under aforementioned distribution shifts.

Such models have been shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, also lacking some basic visual understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks: object classification, understanding spatial arrangement, and ability to delineate individual object instances (through counting), by constructing a series of tests that probe which components of design, specifically, maybe lacking. Importantly, we go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, that simply measure final performance of VLM, by also comparing and contrasting it to performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from visual encoder (image embeddings), as well as intermediate vision-language projection used to bridge image-encoder and LLM-decoder ouput in many SoTA models (e.g., LLaVA, BLIP, InstructBLIP). In doing so, we uncover nascent shortcomings in VLMs response and make a number of important observations which could help train and develop more effective VLM models in future.</p></details> | Under Submission |
| **[PromptKD: Unsupervised Prompt Distillation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02781v5)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has emerged as a valuable technique in enhancing vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP for downstream tasks in specific domains. Existing work mainly focuses on designing various learning forms of prompts, neglecting the potential of prompts as effective distillers for learning from larger teacher models. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised domain prompt distillation framework, which aims to transfer the knowledge of a larger teacher model to a lightweight target model through prompt-driven imitation using unlabeled domain images. Specifically, our framework consists of two distinct stages. In the initial stage, we pre-train a large CLIP teacher model using domain (few-shot) labels. After pre-training, we leverage the unique decoupled-modality characteristics of CLIP by pre-computing and storing the text features as class vectors only once through the teacher text encoder. In the subsequent stage, the stored class vectors are shared across teacher and student image encoders for calculating the predicted logits. Further, we align the logits of both the teacher and student models via KL divergence, encouraging the student image encoder to generate similar probability distributions to the teacher through the learnable prompts. The proposed prompt distillation process eliminates the reliance on labeled data, enabling the algorithm to leverage a vast amount of unlabeled images within the domain. Finally, the well-trained student image encoders and pre-stored text features (class vectors) are utilized for inference. To our best knowledge, we are the first to (1) perform unsupervised domain-specific prompt-driven knowledge distillation for CLIP, and (2) establish a practical pre-storing mechanism of text features as shared class vectors between teacher and student. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024. Project Page: https://zhengli97.github.io/PromptKD.

However, the absence of a general measurement for evaluating object hallucination in VL models has hindered our understanding and ability to mitigate this issue. In this work, we present NOPE (Negative Object Presence Evaluation), a novel benchmark designed to assess object hallucination in VL models through visual question answering (VQA). We propose a cost-effective and scalable approach utilizing large language models to generate 29.5k synthetic negative pronoun (NegP) data of high quality for NOPE. We extensively investigate the performance of 10 state-of-the-art VL models in discerning the non-existence of objects in visual questions, where the ground truth answers are denoted as NegP (e.g., "none"). Additionally, we evaluate their standard performance on visual questions on 9 other VQA datasets. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that no VL model is immune to the vulnerability of object hallucination, as all models achieve accuracy below 10\% on NegP. Furthermore, we uncover that lexically diverse visual questions, question types with large scopes, and scene-relevant objects capitalize the risk of object hallucination in VL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ALVR Workshop at ACL 2024</p></details> |

However, its inference process is uninterpretable, leading to criticism as a black box model. To address this issue, we propose a large vision-language model (LVLM) named IFShip for interpretable fine-grained ship classification. Unlike traditional methods, IFShip excels in interpretability by accurately conveying the reasoning process of FGSC in natural language. Specifically, we first design a domain knowledge-enhanced Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompt generation mechanism. This mechanism is used to semi-automatically construct a task-specific instruction-following dataset named TITANIC-FGS, which emulates human-like logical decision-making. We then train the IFShip model using task instructions tuned with the TITANIC-FGS dataset. Building on IFShip, we develop an FGSC visual chatbot that redefines the FGSC problem as a step-by-step reasoning task and conveys the reasoning process in natural language. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art FGSC algorithms in both classification interpretability and accuracy. Moreover, compared to LVLMs like LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, our approach demonstrates superior expertise in the FGSC task. It provides an accurate chain of reasoning when fine-grained ship types are recognizable to the human eye and offers interpretable explanations when they are not.</p></details> |  |
| **[ActPrompt: In-Domain Feature Adaptation via Action Cues for Video Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06622v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video temporal grounding is an emerging topic aiming to identify specific clips within videos. In addition to pre-trained video models, contemporary methods utilize pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) to capture detailed characteristics of diverse scenes and objects from video frames. However, as pre-trained on images, VLM may struggle to distinguish action-sensitive patterns from static objects, making it necessary to adapt them to specific data domains for effective feature representation over temporal grounding. We address two primary challenges to achieve this goal. Specifically, to mitigate high adaptation costs, we propose an efficient preliminary in-domain fine-tuning paradigm for feature adaptation, where downstream-adaptive features are learned through several pretext tasks. Furthermore, to integrate action-sensitive information into VLM, we introduce Action-Cue-Injected Temporal Prompt Learning (ActPrompt), which injects action cues into the image encoder of VLM for better discovering action-sensitive patterns.

| **[Enhancing Vision-Language Models Generalization via Diversity-Driven Novel Feature Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02586v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot generalization, but finetuning on downstream datasets can cause overfitting and loss of its generalization ability on unseen domains. Although collecting additional data from new domains of interest is possible, this method is often impractical due to the challenges in obtaining annotated data. To address this, we propose a plug-and-play feature synthesis method called LDFS (Language-Guided Diverse Feature Synthesis) to synthesize new domain features and improve existing CLIP fine-tuning strategies. LDFS has three main contributions: 1) To synthesize novel domain features and promote diversity, we propose an instance-conditional feature augmentation strategy based on a text-guided feature augmentation loss. 2) To maintain feature quality after augmenting, we introduce a pairwise regularizer to preserve augmented feature coherence within the CLIP feature space. 3) We propose to use stochastic text feature augmentation to reduce the modality gap and further facilitate the process of text-guided feature synthesis. Extensive experiments show LDFS superiority in improving CLIP generalization ability on unseen domains without collecting data from those domains. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moderating Illicit Online Image Promotion for Unsafe User-Generated Content Games Using Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18957v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online user generated content games (UGCGs) are increasingly popular among children and adolescents for social interaction and more creative online entertainment. However, they pose a heightened risk of exposure to explicit content, raising growing concerns for the online safety of children and adolescents. Despite these concerns, few studies have addressed the issue of illicit image-based promotions of unsafe UGCGs on social media, which can inadvertently attract young users. This challenge arises from the difficulty of obtaining comprehensive training data for UGCG images and the unique nature of these images, which differ from traditional unsafe content. In this work, we take the first step towards studying the threat of illicit promotions of unsafe UGCGs. We collect a real-world dataset comprising 2,924 images that display diverse sexually explicit and violent content used to promote UGCGs by their game creators. Our in-depth studies reveal a new understanding of this problem and the urgent need for automatically flagging illicit UGCG promotions. We additionally create a cutting-edge system, UGCG-Guard, designed to aid social media platforms in effectively identifying images used for illicit UGCG promotions. This system leverages recently introduced large vision-language models (VLMs) and employs a novel conditional prompting strategy for zero-shot domain adaptation, along with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for contextual identification. UGCG-Guard achieves outstanding results, with an accuracy rate of 94% in detecting these images used for the illicit promotion of such games in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in the 33rd USENIX Security Symposium, August 14-16, 2024</p></details> |

We contribute VizWiz-LF, a dataset of long-form answers to visual questions posed by blind and low vision (BLV) users. VizWiz-LF contains 4.2k long-form answers to 600 visual questions, collected from human expert describers and six VQA models. We develop and annotate functional roles of sentences of LFVQA and demonstrate that long-form answers contain information beyond the question answer such as explanations and suggestions. We further conduct automatic and human evaluations with BLV and sighted people to evaluate long-form answers. BLV people perceive both human-written and generated long-form answers to be plausible, but generated answers often hallucinate incorrect visual details, especially for unanswerable visual questions (e.g., blurry or irrelevant images). To reduce hallucinations, we evaluate the ability of VQA models to abstain from answering unanswerable questions across multiple prompting strategies.</p></details> | COLM 2024 |

The OpenIns3D framework employs a "Mask-Snap-Lookup" scheme. The "Mask" module learns class-agnostic mask proposals in 3D point clouds, the "Snap" module generates synthetic scene-level images at multiple scales and leverages 2D vision-language models to extract interesting objects, and the "Lookup" module searches through the outcomes of "Snap" to assign category names to the proposed masks. This approach, yet simple, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D open-vocabulary tasks, including recognition, object detection, and instance segmentation, on both indoor and outdoor datasets. Moreover, OpenIns3D facilitates effortless switching between different 2D detectors without requiring retraining. When integrated with powerful 2D open-world models, it achieves excellent results in scene understanding tasks. Furthermore, when combined with LLM-powered 2D models, OpenIns3D exhibits an impressive capability to comprehend and process highly complex text queries that demand intricate reasoning and real-world knowledge.

Despite the improvement brought by the strong visual backbone in extracting spatial features, CLIP still falls short in capturing and integrating spatial-temporal features which is essential for video recognition. In this paper, we propose OmniCLIP, a framework that adapts CLIP for video recognition by focusing on learning comprehensive features encompassing spatial, temporal, and dynamic spatial-temporal scales, which we refer to as omni-scale features. This is achieved through the design of spatial-temporal blocks that include parallel temporal adapters (PTA), enabling efficient temporal modeling. Additionally, we introduce a self-prompt generator (SPG) module to capture dynamic object spatial features. The synergy between PTA and SPG allows OmniCLIP to discern varying spatial information across frames and assess object scales over time. We have conducted extensive experiments in supervised video recognition, few-shot video recognition, and zero-shot recognition tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially with OmniCLIP achieving a top-1 accuracy of 74.30\% on HMDB51 in a 16-shot setting, surpassing the recent MotionPrompt approach even with full training data.

| **[Learning Invariant Causal Mechanism from Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15289v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP have been widely applied to a variety of downstream scenarios. In real-world applications, the CLIP model is often utilized in more diverse scenarios than those encountered during its training, a challenge known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. However, our experiments reveal that CLIP performs unsatisfactorily in certain domains. Through a causal analysis, we find that CLIP's current prediction process cannot guarantee a low OOD risk. The lowest OOD risk can be achieved when the prediction process is based on invariant causal mechanisms, i.e., predicting solely based on invariant latent factors. However, theoretical analysis indicates that CLIP does not identify these invariant latent factors. Therefore, we propose the Invariant Causal Mechanism for CLIP (CLIP-ICM), a framework that first identifies invariant latent factors using interventional data and then performs invariant predictions across various domains. Our method is simple yet effective, without significant computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIP-ICM significantly improves CLIP's performance in OOD scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting a Foundation Model for Space-based Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05924v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, e.g., large language models, possess attributes of intelligence which offer promise to endow a robot with the contextual understanding necessary to navigate complex, unstructured tasks in the wild. In the future of space robotics, we see three core challenges which motivate the use of a foundation model adapted to space-based applications: 1) Scalability of ground-in-the-loop operations; 2) Generalizing prior knowledge to novel environments; and 3) Multi-modality in tasks and sensor data. Therefore, as a first-step towards building a foundation model for space-based applications, we automatically label the AI4Mars dataset to curate a language annotated dataset of visual-question-answer tuples. We fine-tune a pretrained LLaVA checkpoint on this dataset to endow a vision-language model with the ability to perform spatial reasoning and navigation on Mars' surface. In this work, we demonstrate that 1) existing vision-language models are deficient visual reasoners in space-based applications, and 2) fine-tuning a vision-language model on extraterrestrial data significantly improves the quality of responses even with a limited training dataset of only a few thousand samples.</p></details> |  |

While VLMs perform well on vision tasks that they are trained on, our results highlight key challenges in abstract pattern recognition. We present GlyphPattern, a 954 item dataset that pairs 318 human-written descriptions of visual patterns from 40 writing systems with three visual presentation styles. GlyphPattern evaluates abstract pattern recognition in VLMs, requiring models to understand and judge natural language descriptions of visual patterns. GlyphPattern patterns are drawn from a large-scale cognitive science investigation of human writing systems; as a result, they are rich in spatial reference and compositionality. Our experiments show that GlyphPattern is challenging for state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o achieves only 55% accuracy), with marginal gains from few-shot prompting. Our detailed error analysis reveals challenges at multiple levels, including visual processing, natural language understanding, and pattern generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Generative Communication between Embodied Agents Good for Zero-Shot ObjectNav?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01877v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Zero-Shot ObjectNav, an embodied ground agent is expected to navigate to a target object specified by a natural language label without any environment-specific fine-tuning. This is challenging, given the limited view of a ground agent and its independent exploratory behavior. To address these issues, we consider an assistive overhead agent with a bounded global view alongside the ground agent and present two coordinated navigation schemes for judicious exploration. We establish the influence of the Generative Communication (GC) between the embodied agents equipped with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in improving zero-shot ObjectNav, achieving a 10% improvement in the ground agent's ability to find the target object in comparison with an unassisted setup in simulation. We further analyze the GC for unique traits quantifying the presence of hallucination and cooperation. In particular, we identify a unique trait of "preemptive hallucination" specific to our embodied setting, where the overhead agent assumes that the ground agent has executed an action in the dialogue when it is yet to move. Finally, we conduct real-world inferences with GC and showcase qualitative examples where countering pre-emptive hallucination via prompt finetuning improves real-world ObjectNav performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05775v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models have showcased impressive zero-shot classification capabilities when equipped with suitable text prompts. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of test-time prompt tuning; however, these methods typically require per-image prompt adaptation during inference, which incurs high computational budgets and limits scalability and practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we introduce Self-TPT, a novel framework leveraging Self-supervised learning for efficient Test-time Prompt Tuning. The key aspect of Self-TPT is that it turns to efficient predefined class adaptation via self-supervised learning, thus avoiding computation-heavy per-image adaptation at inference. Self-TPT begins by co-training the self-supervised and the classification task using source data, then applies the self-supervised task exclusively for test-time new class adaptation. Specifically, we propose Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPT) as the key task for self-supervision. CPT is designed to minimize the intra-class distances while enhancing inter-class distinguishability via contrastive learning. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that CPT could closely mimic back-propagated gradients of the classification task, offering a plausible explanation for its effectiveness. Motivated by this finding, we further introduce a gradient matching loss to explicitly enhance the gradient similarity. We evaluated Self-TPT across three challenging zero-shot benchmarks. The results consistently demonstrate that Self-TPT not only significantly reduces inference costs but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing the efficiency-efficacy trade-off.</p></details> |  |

While LVLMs exhibit excellent ability in language understanding, question answering, and conversations of visual inputs, they are prone to producing hallucinations. While several methods are proposed to evaluate the hallucinations in LVLMs, most are reference-based and depend on external tools, which complicates their practical application. To assess the viability of alternative methods, it is critical to understand whether the reference-free approaches, which do not rely on any external tools, can efficiently detect hallucinations. Therefore, we initiate an exploratory study to demonstrate the effectiveness of different reference-free solutions in detecting hallucinations in LVLMs. In particular, we conduct an extensive study on three kinds of techniques: uncertainty-based, consistency-based, and supervised uncertainty quantification methods on four representative LVLMs across two different tasks. The empirical results show that the reference-free approaches are capable of effectively detecting non-factual responses in LVLMs, with the supervised uncertainty quantification method outperforming the others, achieving the best performance across different settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoder Pre-Training with only Text for Scene Text Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05706v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene text recognition (STR) pre-training methods have achieved remarkable progress, primarily relying on synthetic datasets. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real images poses a challenge in acquiring feature representations that align well with images on real scenes, thereby limiting the performance of these methods. We note that vision-language models like CLIP, pre-trained on extensive real image-text pairs, effectively align images and text in a unified embedding space, suggesting the potential to derive the representations of real images from text alone. Building upon this premise, we introduce a novel method named Decoder Pre-training with only text for STR (DPTR). DPTR treats text embeddings produced by the CLIP text encoder as pseudo visual embeddings and uses them to pre-train the decoder. An Offline Randomized Perturbation (ORP) strategy is introduced. It enriches the diversity of text embeddings by incorporating natural image embeddings extracted from the CLIP image encoder, effectively directing the decoder to acquire the potential representations of real images. In addition, we introduce a Feature Merge Unit (FMU) that guides the extracted visual embeddings focusing on the character foreground within the text image, thereby enabling the pre-trained decoder to work more efficiently and accurately. Extensive experiments across various STR decoders and language recognition tasks underscore the broad applicability and remarkable performance of DPTR, providing a novel insight for STR pre-training.

Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have recently emerged due to their robust vision-understanding capabilities. However, training these models requires vast amounts of data, posing challenges to efficiency, effectiveness, data quality, and privacy. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a novel data synthesis pipeline for VLLMs. Unlike existing methods that generate captions from images, SynthVLM employs advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to automatically generate and select high-resolution images from captions, creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. Leveraging these pairs, we achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on various vision question answering tasks, maintaining high alignment quality and preserving advanced language abilities. Moreover, SynthVLM surpasses traditional GPT-4 Vision-based caption generation methods in performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Crucially, our method's reliance on purely generated data ensures the preservation of privacy, achieving SoTA performance with just 100k data points (only 18% of the official dataset size).</p></details> |  |

Among these cutting-edge developments, Google's Bard stands out for its remarkable multimodal capabilities, promoting comprehensive comprehension and reasoning across various domains. This work presents an early and holistic evaluation of LVLMs' multimodal abilities, with a particular focus on Bard, by proposing a lightweight variant of LVLM-eHub, named Tiny LVLM-eHub. In comparison to the vanilla version, Tiny LVLM-eHub possesses several appealing properties. Firstly, it provides a systematic assessment of six categories of multimodal capabilities, including visual perception, visual knowledge acquisition, visual reasoning, visual commonsense, object hallucination, and embodied intelligence, through quantitative evaluation of $42$ standard text-related visual benchmarks. Secondly, it conducts an in-depth analysis of LVLMs' predictions using the ChatGPT Ensemble Evaluation (CEE), which leads to a robust and accurate evaluation and exhibits improved alignment with human evaluation compared to the word matching approach. Thirdly, it comprises a mere $2.1$K image-text pairs, facilitating ease of use for practitioners to evaluate their own offline LVLMs. Through extensive experimental analysis, this study demonstrates that Bard outperforms previous LVLMs in most multimodal capabilities except object hallucination, to which Bard is still susceptible. Tiny LVLM-eHub serves as a baseline evaluation for various LVLMs and encourages innovative strategies aimed at advancing multimodal techniques.

However, their application in modern vision-language models (VLMs) has been limited. A notable exception is MERU, which leverages the hierarchical properties of hyperbolic space in the CLIP ViT-large model, consisting of hundreds of millions parameters. In our work, we address the challenges of scaling multi-modal hyperbolic models by orders of magnitude in terms of parameters (billions) and training complexity using the BLIP-2 architecture. Although hyperbolic embeddings offer potential insights into uncertainty not present in Euclidean embeddings, our analysis reveals that scaling these models is particularly difficult. We propose a novel training strategy for a hyperbolic version of BLIP-2, which allows to achieve comparable performance to its Euclidean counterpart, while maintaining stability throughout the training process and showing a meaningful indication of uncertainty with each embedding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 - Beyond Euclidean Workshop</p></details> |

Beyond object classification and detection, VLMs are capable of visual comprehension and common-sense reasoning. This naturally led to the question: How do VLMs respond when the image itself is inherently unreasonable? To this end, we present IllusionVQA: a diverse dataset of challenging optical illusions and hard-to-interpret scenes to test the capability of VLMs in two distinct multiple-choice VQA tasks - comprehension and soft localization. GPT4V, the best performing VLM, achieves 62.99% accuracy (4-shot) on the comprehension task and 49.7% on the localization task (4-shot and Chain-of-Thought). Human evaluation reveals that humans achieve 91.03% and 100% accuracy in comprehension and localization. We discover that In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought reasoning substantially degrade the performance of Gemini-Pro in the localization task. Tangentially, we discover a potential weakness in the ICL capabilities of VLMs: they fail to locate optical illusions even when the correct answer is in the context window as a few-shot example.</p></details> |  |

In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs' effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date. It is constructed from 285 datasets across 39 medical image modalities, 18 clinical-related tasks, 18 departments, and 4 perceptual granularities in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. Additionally, we implemented a lexical tree structure that allows users to customize evaluation tasks, accommodating various assessment needs and substantially supporting medical AI research and applications. We evaluated 50 LVLMs, and the results show that even the advanced GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of 52%, indicating significant room for improvement. Moreover, we identified five key insufficiencies in current cutting-edge LVLMs that need to be addressed to advance the development of better medical applications. We believe that GMAI-MMBench will stimulate the community to build the next generation of LVLMs toward GMAI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoid Wasted Annotation Costs in Open-set Active Learning with Pre-trained Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04917v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning (AL) aims to enhance model performance by selectively collecting highly informative data, thereby minimizing annotation costs. However, in practical scenarios, unlabeled data may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, leading to wasted annotation costs if data is incorrectly selected. Recent research has explored methods to apply AL to open-set data, but these methods often require or incur unavoidable cost losses to minimize them. To address these challenges, we propose a novel selection strategy, CLIPN for AL (CLIPNAL), which minimizes cost losses without requiring OOD samples. CLIPNAL sequentially evaluates the purity and informativeness of data. First, it utilizes a pre-trained vision-language model to detect and exclude OOD data by leveraging linguistic and visual information of in-distribution (ID) data without additional training. Second, it selects highly informative data from the remaining ID data, and then the selected samples are annotated by human experts. Experimental results on datasets with various open-set conditions demonstrate that CLIPNAL achieves the lowest cost loss and highest performance across all scenarios.

| **[Advancing Prompt Learning through an External Layer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19674v5)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning represents a promising method for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks by learning a set of text embeddings. One challenge inherent to these methods is the poor generalization performance due to the invalidity of the learned text embeddings for unseen tasks. A straightforward approach to bridge this gap is to freeze the text embeddings in prompts, which results in a lack of capacity to adapt VLMs for downstream tasks. To address this dilemma, we propose a paradigm called EnPrompt with a novel External Layer (EnLa). Specifically, we propose a textual external layer and learnable visual embeddings for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. The learnable external layer is built upon valid embeddings of pre-trained CLIP. This design considers the balance of learning capabilities between the two branches. To align the textual and visual features, we propose a novel two-pronged approach: i) we introduce the optimal transport as the discrepancy metric to align the vision and text modalities, and ii) we introduce a novel strengthening feature to enhance the interaction between these two modalities. Four representative experiments (i.e., base-to-novel generalization, few-shot learning, cross-dataset generalization, domain shifts generalization) across 15 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing prompt learning method.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we empirically investigate what text prompt encoders (e.g., CLIP or LLM) are good for adapting SAM for referring expression segmentation and introduce the Early Vision-language Fusion-based SAM (EVF-SAM). EVF-SAM is a simple yet effective referring segmentation method which exploits multimodal prompts (i.e., image and text) and comprises a pre-trained vision-language model to generate referring prompts and a SAM model for segmentation. Surprisingly, we observe that: (1) multimodal prompts and (2) vision-language models with early fusion (e.g., BEIT-3) are beneficial for prompting SAM for accurate referring segmentation. Our experiments show that the proposed EVF-SAM based on BEIT-3 can obtain state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO/+/g for referring expression segmentation and demonstrate the superiority of prompting SAM with early vision-language fusion. In addition, the proposed EVF-SAM with 1.32B parameters achieves remarkably higher performance while reducing nearly 82% of parameters compared to previous SAM methods based on large multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We propose three self-supervised challenges with corresponding evaluation metrics to comprehensively evaluate VLMs on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), spatial perception, and visual format recognition. Additionally, we utilize the spreadsheet table detection task to assess the overall performance of VLMs by integrating these challenges. To probe VLMs more finely, we propose three spreadsheet-to-image settings: column width adjustment, style change, and address augmentation. We propose variants of prompts to address the above tasks in different settings. Notably, to leverage the strengths of VLMs in understanding text rather than two-dimensional positioning, we propose to decode cell values on the four boundaries of the table in spreadsheet boundary detection. Our findings reveal that VLMs demonstrate promising OCR capabilities but produce unsatisfactory results due to cell omission and misalignment, and they notably exhibit insufficient spatial and format recognition skills, motivating future work to enhance VLMs' spreadsheet data comprehension capabilities using our methods to generate extensive spreadsheet-image pairs in various settings.</p></details> |  |

The proposed VLM-MPC system is structurally divided into two asynchronous components: an upper-level VLM and a lower-level MPC. The upper layer VLM generates driving parameters for lower-level control based on front camera images, ego vehicle state, traffic environment conditions, and reference memory. The lower-level MPC controls the vehicle in real-time using these parameters, considering engine lag and providing state feedback to the entire system. Experiments based on the nuScenes dataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed VLM-MPC system across various scenarios (e.g., night, rain, intersections). Results showed that the VLM-MPC system consistently outperformed baseline models in terms of safety and driving comfort. By comparing behaviors under different weather conditions and scenarios, we demonstrated the VLM's ability to understand the environment and make reasonable inferences.</p></details> |  |

Yet, with an ever-growing number of benchmarks, researchers are tasked with the heavy burden of implementing each protocol, bearing a non-trivial computational cost, and making sense of how all these benchmarks translate into meaningful axes of progress. To facilitate a systematic evaluation of VLM progress, we introduce UniBench: a unified implementation of 50+ VLM benchmarks spanning a comprehensive range of carefully categorized capabilities from object recognition to spatial awareness, counting, and much more. We showcase the utility of UniBench for measuring progress by evaluating nearly 60 publicly available vision-language models, trained on scales of up to 12.8B samples. We find that while scaling training data or model size can boost many vision-language model capabilities, scaling offers little benefit for reasoning or relations. Surprisingly, we also discover today's best VLMs struggle on simple digit recognition and counting tasks, e.g. MNIST, which much simpler networks can solve. Where scale falls short, we find that more precise interventions, such as data quality or tailored-learning objectives offer more promise. For practitioners, we also offer guidance on selecting a suitable VLM for a given application. Finally, we release an easy-to-run UniBench code-base with the full set of 50+ benchmarks and comparisons across 59 models as well as a distilled, representative set of benchmarks that runs in 5 minutes on a single GPU.</p></details> |  |

In many perception tasks only pre-processed radar point clouds are considered. In contrast, radar spectra are a raw form of radar measurements and contain more information than radar point clouds. However, radar spectra are rather difficult to interpret. In this work, we aim to explore the semantic information contained in spectra in the context of automated driving, thereby moving towards better interpretability of radar spectra. To this end, we create a radar spectra-language model, allowing us to query radar spectra measurements for the presence of scene elements using free text. We overcome the scarcity of radar spectra data by matching the embedding space of an existing vision-language model. Finally, we explore the benefit of the learned representation for scene retrieval using radar spectra only, and obtain improvements in free space segmentation and object detection merely by injecting the spectra embedding into a baseline model.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel, easy-to-use approach to achieving high-quality representations that lead to adversarial robustness through the use of multi-resolution input representations and dynamic self-ensembling of intermediate layer predictions. We demonstrate that intermediate layer predictions exhibit inherent robustness to adversarial attacks crafted to fool the full classifier, and propose a robust aggregation mechanism based on Vickrey auction that we call \textit{CrossMax} to dynamically ensemble them. By combining multi-resolution inputs and robust ensembling, we achieve significant adversarial robustness on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets without any adversarial training or extra data, reaching an adversarial accuracy of $\approx$72% (CIFAR-10) and $\approx$48% (CIFAR-100) on the RobustBench AutoAttack suite ($L_\infty=8/255)$ with a finetuned ImageNet-pretrained ResNet152. This represents a result comparable with the top three models on CIFAR-10 and a +5 % gain compared to the best current dedicated approach on CIFAR-100. Adding simple adversarial training on top, we get $\approx$78% on CIFAR-10 and $\approx$51% on CIFAR-100, improving SOTA by 5 % and 9 % respectively and seeing greater gains on the harder dataset. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and provide insights into the interplay between adversarial robustness, and the hierarchical nature of deep representations. We show that simple gradient-based attacks against our model lead to human-interpretable images of the target classes as well as interpretable image changes. As a byproduct, using our multi-resolution prior, we turn pre-trained classifiers and CLIP models into controllable image generators and develop successful transferable attacks on large vision language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 25 figures, appendix</p></details> |

In robotic grasping, estimating the reflectance of objects is crucial for successful grasping, as it significantly impacts the distance measured by proximity sensors. We investigate whether LLMs can estimate reflectance from object names alone, leveraging the embedded human knowledge in distributional semantics, and if the latent structure of language in VLMs positively affects image-based reflectance estimation. In this paper, we verify that 1) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can estimate an object's reflectance using only text as input; and 2) VLMs such as CLIP can increase their generalization capabilities in reflectance estimation from images. Our experiments show that GPT-4 can estimate an object's reflectance using only text input with a mean error of 14.7%, lower than the image-only ResNet. Moreover, CLIP achieved the lowest mean error of 11.8%, while GPT-3.5 obtained a competitive 19.9% compared to ResNet's 17.8%. These results suggest that the distributional semantics in LLMs and VLMs increases their generalization capabilities, and the knowledge acquired by VLMs benefits from the latent structure of language.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, submitted to Advanced Robotics Special Issue on Real-World Robot Applications of the Foundation Models</p></details> |
| **[From Concept to Manufacturing: Evaluating Vision-Language Models for Engineering Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12668v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engineering design is undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of AI, marking a new era in how we approach product, system, and service planning. Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in enabling this shift. Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leverage the large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries and are accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many more types of tasks. Our work presents a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs across a spectrum of engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas: Conceptual Design, System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing and Inspection, and Engineering Education Tasks. Specifically in this paper, we assess the capabilities of two VLMs, GPT-4V and LLaVA 1.6 34B, in design tasks such as sketch similarity analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization, manufacturability assessment, and engineering textbook problems. Through this structured evaluation, we not only explore VLMs' proficiency in handling complex design challenges but also identify their limitations in complex engineering design applications. Our research establishes a foundation for future assessments of vision language models. It also contributes a set of benchmark testing datasets, with more than 1000 queries, for ongoing advancements and applications in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArtVLM: Attribute Recognition Through Vision-Based Prefix Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04102v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and disentangling visual attributes from objects is a foundation to many computer vision applications. While large vision language representations like CLIP had largely resolved the task of zero-shot object recognition, zero-shot visual attribute recognition remains a challenge because CLIP's contrastively-learned vision-language representation cannot effectively capture object-attribute dependencies. In this paper, we target this weakness and propose a sentence generation-based retrieval formulation for attribute recognition that is novel in 1) explicitly modeling a to-be-measured and retrieved object-attribute relation as a conditional probability graph, which converts the recognition problem into a dependency-sensitive language-modeling problem, and 2) applying a large pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) on this reformulation and naturally distilling its knowledge of image-object-attribute relations to use towards attribute recognition. Specifically, for each attribute to be recognized on an image, we measure the visual-conditioned probability of generating a short sentence encoding the attribute's relation to objects on the image. Unlike contrastive retrieval, which measures likelihood by globally aligning elements of the sentence to the image, generative retrieval is sensitive to the order and dependency of objects and attributes in the sentence. We demonstrate through experiments that generative retrieval consistently outperforms contrastive retrieval on two visual reasoning datasets, Visual Attribute in the Wild (VAW), and our newly-proposed Visual Genome Attribute Ranking (VGARank).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, how well these VLMs can see image detail beyond the semantic level remains unclear. In our study, we introduce a pixel value prediction task (PVP) to explore "How Well Can Vision Language Models See Image Details?" and to assist VLMs in perceiving more details. Typically, these models comprise a frozen CLIP visual encoder, a large language model, and a connecting module. After fine-tuning VLMs on the PVP task, we find: 1) existing VLMs struggle to predict precise pixel values by only fine-tuning the connection module and LLM; and 2) prediction precision is significantly improved when the vision encoder is also adapted. Additionally, our research reveals that incorporating pixel value prediction as one of the VLM pre-training tasks and vision encoder adaptation markedly boosts VLM performance on downstream image-language understanding tasks requiring detailed image perception, such as referring image segmentation (with an average +10.19 cIoU improvement) and video game decision making (with average score improvements of +80.34 and +70.54 on two games, respectively).</p></details> |  |
| **[Target Prompting for Information Extraction with Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03834v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent trend in the Large Vision and Language model has brought a new change in how information extraction systems are built. VLMs have set a new benchmark with their State-of-the-art techniques in understanding documents and building question-answering systems across various industries. They are significantly better at generating text from document images and providing accurate answers to questions. However, there are still some challenges in effectively utilizing these models to build a precise conversational system. General prompting techniques used with large language models are often not suitable for these specially designed vision language models. The output generated by such generic input prompts is ordinary and may contain information gaps when compared with the actual content of the document. To obtain more accurate and specific answers, a well-targeted prompt is required by the vision language model, along with the document image. In this paper, a technique is discussed called Target prompting, which focuses on explicitly targeting parts of document images and generating related answers from those specific regions only. The paper also covers the evaluation of response for each prompting technique using different user queries and input prompts.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

We propose an approach that appends first names to ethically annotated text scenarios to reveal demographic biases in model outputs. Our study involves a curated list of more than 300 names representing diverse genders and ethnic backgrounds, tested across thousands of moral scenarios. Following the auditing methodologies from social sciences we propose a detailed analysis involving popular LLMs/VLMs to contribute to the field of responsible AI by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and mitigating biases in these systems. Furthermore, we introduce a novel benchmark, the Pratical Scenarios Benchmark (PSB), designed to assess the presence of biases involving gender or demographic prejudices in everyday decision-making scenarios as well as practical scenarios where an LLM might be used to make sensible decisions (e.g., granting mortgages or insurances). This benchmark allows for a comprehensive comparison of model behaviors across different demographic categories, highlighting the risks and biases that may arise in practical applications of LLMs and VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV workshop FAILED</p></details> |

Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Openstory++: A Large-scale Dataset and Benchmark for Instance-aware Open-domain Visual Storytelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03695v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image generation models excel at creating high-quality images from brief captions. However, they fail to maintain consistency of multiple instances across images when encountering lengthy contexts. This inconsistency is largely due to in existing training datasets the absence of granular instance feature labeling in existing training datasets. To tackle these issues, we introduce Openstory++, a large-scale dataset combining additional instance-level annotations with both images and text. Furthermore, we develop a training methodology that emphasizes entity-centric image-text generation, ensuring that the models learn to effectively interweave visual and textual information. Specifically, Openstory++ streamlines the process of keyframe extraction from open-domain videos, employing vision-language models to generate captions that are then polished by a large language model for narrative continuity. It surpasses previous datasets by offering a more expansive open-domain resource, which incorporates automated captioning, high-resolution imagery tailored for instance count, and extensive frame sequences for temporal consistency. Additionally, we present Cohere-Bench, a pioneering benchmark framework for evaluating the image generation tasks when long multimodal context is provided, including the ability to keep the background, style, instances in the given context coherent. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work fills critical gaps in multi-modal generation, propelling the development of models that can adeptly generate and interpret complex narratives in open-domain environments. Experiments conducted within Cohere-Bench confirm the superiority of Openstory++ in nurturing high-quality visual storytelling models, enhancing their ability to address open-domain generation tasks.

While pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive performance on various vision tasks, their potential for ordinal regression has received less exploration. In this study, we first investigate CLIP's potential for ordinal regression, from which we expect the model could generalise to different ordinal regression tasks and scenarios. Unfortunately, vanilla CLIP fails on this task, since current VLMs have a well-documented limitation of encapsulating compositional concepts such as number sense. We propose a simple yet effective method called NumCLIP to improve the quantitative understanding of VLMs. We disassemble the exact image to number-specific text matching problem into coarse classification and fine prediction stages. We discretize and phrase each numerical bin with common language concept to better leverage the available pre-trained alignment in CLIP. To consider the inherent continuous property of ordinal regression, we propose a novel fine-grained cross-modal ranking-based regularisation loss specifically designed to keep both semantic and ordinal alignment in CLIP's feature space. Experimental results on three general ordinal regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of NumCLIP, with 10% and 3.83% accuracy improvement on historical image dating and image aesthetics assessment task, respectively.

To obtain these category-specific prompts, the present methods rely on hand-crafting the prompts to the LLMs for generating VLM prompts for the downstream tasks. However, this requires manually composing these task-specific prompts and still, they might not cover the diverse set of visual concepts and task-specific styles associated with the categories of interest. To effectively take humans out of the loop and completely automate the prompt generation process for zero-shot recognition, we propose Meta-Prompting for Visual Recognition (MPVR). Taking as input only minimal information about the target task, in the form of its short natural language description, and a list of associated class labels, MPVR automatically produces a diverse set of category-specific prompts resulting in a strong zero-shot classifier. MPVR generalizes effectively across various popular zero-shot image recognition benchmarks belonging to widely different domains when tested with multiple LLMs and VLMs. For example, MPVR obtains a zero-shot recognition improvement over CLIP by up to 19.8% and 18.2% (5.0% and 4.5% on average over 20 datasets) leveraging GPT and Mixtral LLMs, respectively</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV Camera Ready.

We propose a new VPI method, "goal hijacking via visual prompt injection" (GHVPI), that swaps the execution task of LVLMs from an original task to an alternative task designated by an attacker. The quantitative analysis indicates that GPT-4V is vulnerable to the GHVPI and demonstrates a notable attack success rate of 15.8%, which is an unignorable security risk. Our analysis also shows that successful GHVPI requires high character recognition capability and instruction-following ability in LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to NAACL 2024 SRW</p></details> |

While recent surgical AI models have focused on solving task-specific problems, there is a need for general-purpose systems that can understand surgical scenes and interact through natural language. This paper introduces GP-VLS, a general-purpose vision language model for surgery that integrates medical and surgical knowledge with visual scene understanding. For comprehensively evaluating general-purpose surgical models, we propose SurgiQual, which evaluates across medical and surgical knowledge benchmarks as well as surgical vision-language questions. To train GP-VLS, we develop six new datasets spanning medical knowledge, surgical textbooks, and vision-language pairs for tasks like phase recognition and tool identification. We show that GP-VLS significantly outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on surgical vision-language tasks, with 8-21% improvements in accuracy across SurgiQual benchmarks. GP-VLS also demonstrates strong performance on medical and surgical knowledge tests compared to open-source alternatives. Overall, GP-VLS provides an open-source foundation for developing AI assistants to support surgeons across a wide range of tasks and scenarios.

However, existing multimodal benchmarks focus on primary perception abilities and commonsense knowledge which are insufficient to reflect the comprehensive capabilities of LVLMs. We propose GAOKAO-MM, a multimodal benchmark based on the Chinese College Entrance Examination (GAOKAO), comprising of 8 subjects and 12 types of images, such as diagrams, function graphs, maps and photos. GAOKAO-MM derives from native Chinese context and sets human-level requirements for the model's abilities, including perception, understanding, knowledge and reasoning. We evaluate 10 LVLMs and find that the accuracies of all of them are lower than 50%, with GPT-4-Vison (48.1%), Qwen-VL-Plus (41.2%) and Gemini-Pro-Vision (35.1%) ranking in the top three positions. The results of our multi-dimension analysis indicate that LVLMs have moderate distance towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and provide insights facilitating the development of multilingual LVLMs.</p></details> |  |

The inherent heterogeneity of content within multimodal inputs and outputs presents a significant challenge to the execution of MSMO. Traditional approaches typically adopt a holistic perspective on coarse image-text data or individual visual objects, overlooking the essential connections between objects and the entities they represent. To integrate the fine-grained entity knowledge, we propose an Entity-Guided Multimodal Summarization model (EGMS). Our model, building on BART, utilizes dual multimodal encoders with shared weights to process text-image and entity-image information concurrently. A gating mechanism then combines visual data for enhanced textual summary generation, while image selection is refined through knowledge distillation from a pre-trained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on public MSMO dataset validate the superiority of the EGMS method, which also prove the necessity to incorporate entity information into MSMO problem.</p></details> | In ACL-Findings 2024 |

These programs are complex to use and typically require years of training and experience to master. Structured and well-constrained 2D sketches and 3D constructions are crucial components of CAD modeling. A well-executed CAD model can be seamlessly integrated into the manufacturing process, thereby enhancing production efficiency. Deep generative models of 3D shapes and 3D object reconstruction models have garnered significant research interest. However, most of these models produce discrete forms of 3D objects that are not editable. Moreover, the few models based on CAD operations often have substantial input restrictions. In this work, we fine-tuned pre-trained models to create OpenECAD models (0.55B, 0.89B, 2.4B and 3.1B), leveraging the visual, logical, coding, and general capabilities of visual language models. OpenECAD models can process images of 3D designs as input and generate highly structured 2D sketches and 3D construction commands, ensuring that the designs are editable. These outputs can be directly used with existing CAD tools' APIs to generate project files. To train our network, we created a series of OpenECAD datasets. These datasets are derived from existing public CAD datasets, adjusted and augmented to meet the specific requirements of vision language model (VLM) training. Additionally, we have introduced an approach that utilizes dependency relationships to define and generate sketches, further enriching the content and functionality of the datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, LVLMs struggle with object hallucinations due to their reliance on text cues and learned object co-occurrence biases. While most research quantifies these hallucinations, mitigation strategies are still lacking. Our study introduces a Language Contrastive Decoding (LCD) algorithm that adjusts LVLM outputs based on LLM distribution confidence levels, effectively reducing object hallucinations. We demonstrate the advantages of LCD in leading LVLMs, showing up to %4 improvement in POPE F1 scores and up to %36 reduction in CHAIR scores on the COCO validation set, while also improving captioning quality scores. Our method effectively improves LVLMs without needing complex post-processing or retraining, and is easily applicable to different models.

However, the insulated nature of training restricts the capability of classical detectors to obtain open-world facts. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have encoded rich world knowledge, they are not inherently tailored for combating fake news and struggle to comprehend local forgery details. In this paper, we propose FKA-Owl, a novel framework that leverages forgery-specific knowledge to augment LVLMs, enabling them to reason about manipulations effectively. The augmented forgery-specific knowledge includes semantic correlation between text and images, and artifact trace in image manipulation. To inject these two kinds of knowledge into the LVLM, we design two specialized modules to establish their representations, respectively. The encoded knowledge embeddings are then incorporated into LVLMs. Extensive experiments on the public benchmark demonstrate that FKA-Owl achieves superior cross-domain performance compared to previous methods.

While most attacks target encoders on the upstream side, it remains unknown how an encoder could be threatened when deployed in a downstream ML service. This paper unveils a new vulnerability: the Pre-trained Encoder Inference (PEI) attack, which posts privacy threats toward encoders hidden behind downstream ML services. By only providing API accesses to a targeted downstream service and a set of candidate encoders, the PEI attack can infer which encoder is secretly used by the targeted service based on candidate ones. We evaluate the attack performance of PEI against real-world encoders on three downstream tasks: image classification, text classification, and text-to-image generation. Experiments show that the PEI attack succeeds in revealing the hidden encoder in most cases and seldom makes mistakes even when the hidden encoder is not in the candidate set. We also conducted a case study on one of the most recent vision-language models, LLaVA, to illustrate that the PEI attack is useful in assisting other ML attacks such as adversarial attacks.

Recent multi-image LVLMs have begun to address this need. However, their evaluation has not kept pace with their development. To fill this gap, we introduce the Multimodal Multi-image Understanding (MMIU) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess LVLMs across a wide range of multi-image tasks. MMIU encompasses 7 types of multi-image relationships, 52 tasks, 77K images, and 11K meticulously curated multiple-choice questions, making it the most extensive benchmark of its kind. Our evaluation of 24 popular LVLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, reveals significant challenges in multi-image comprehension, particularly in tasks involving spatial understanding. Even the most advanced models, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 55.7% accuracy on MMIU. Through multi-faceted analytical experiments, we identify key performance gaps and limitations, providing valuable insights for future model and data improvements. We aim for MMIU to advance the frontier of LVLM research and development, moving us toward achieving sophisticated multimodal multi-image user interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mmiu-bench.github.io/</p></details> |

This is due to random negative samples during pretraining, causing almost exclusively very dissimilar concepts to be compared in the loss function. Consequently, the models struggle with fine-grained semantic differences. To address this problem, we introduce a novel pretraining method incorporating synthetic hard negative text examples. The hard negatives permute terms corresponding to visual concepts, leading to a more fine-grained visual and textual concept alignment. Further, we introduce InpaintCOCO, a new challenging dataset for assessing the fine-grained alignment of colors, objects, and sizes in vision-language models. We created the dataset using generative inpainting from COCO images by changing the visual concepts so that the images no longer match their original captions. Our results show significant improvements in fine-grained concept understanding across a wide range of vision-language datasets, including our InpaintCOCO dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring or manually designing rewards for all open-ended tasks is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework architecture, CLIP4MC, aiming to learn a reinforcement learning (RL) friendly vision-language model (VLM) that serves as an intrinsic reward function for open-ended tasks. Simply utilizing the similarity between the video snippet and the language prompt is not RL-friendly since standard VLMs may only capture the similarity at a coarse level. To achieve RL-friendliness, we incorporate the task completion degree into the VLM training objective, as this information can assist agents in distinguishing the importance between different states. Moreover, we provide neat YouTube datasets based on the large-scale YouTube database provided by MineDojo. Specifically, two rounds of filtering operations guarantee that the dataset covers enough essential information and that the video-text pair is highly correlated. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance on RL tasks compared with baselines.

It uses a sparse model to replace the dense model, achieving comparable performance while activating fewer parameters during inference, thus significantly reducing the inference cost. Existing MoE methods in LVLMs encourage different experts to handle different tokens, and they usually employ a router to predict the routing of each token. However, the predictions are based solely on sample features and do not truly reveal the optimization directions of tokens. This may lead to severe optimization interference between different tokens assigned to an expert. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel method based on token-level gradient analysis, i.e., Solving Token Gradient Conflict (STGC). Specifically, we first use token-level gradients to identify conflicting tokens in experts. After that, we add a specialized loss tailored to eliminate conflicts among tokens within each expert. Our method can serve as a plug-in for diverse Large Vision-Language Models, and extensive experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/longrongyang/STGC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation on Inconsistent Taxonomy using VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02261v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenge of semantic segmentation in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) emerges not only from domain shifts between source and target images but also from discrepancies in class taxonomies across domains. Traditional UDA research assumes consistent taxonomy between the source and target domains, thereby limiting their ability to recognize and adapt to the taxonomy of the target domain. This paper introduces a novel approach, Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation on Inconsistent Taxonomy using Vision Language Models (CSI), which effectively performs domain-adaptive semantic segmentation even in situations of source-target class mismatches. CSI leverages the semantic generalization potential of Visual Language Models (VLMs) to create synergy with previous UDA methods. It leverages segment reasoning obtained through traditional UDA methods, combined with the rich semantic knowledge embedded in VLMs, to relabel new classes in the target domain. This approach allows for effective adaptation to extended taxonomies without requiring any ground truth label for the target domain. Our method has shown to be effective across various benchmarks in situations of inconsistent taxonomy settings (coarse-to-fine taxonomy and open taxonomy) and demonstrates consistent synergy effects when integrated with previous state-of-the-art UDA methods. The implementation is available at http://github.com/jkee58/CSI.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

This study evaluates the efficacy of an advanced vision-language foundation model, OWLv2, in detecting and classifying various helmet-wearing statuses of motorcycle occupants using video data. We extend the dataset provided by the CVPR AI City Challenge and employ a cascaded model approach for detection and classification tasks, integrating OWLv2 and CNN models. The results highlight the potential of zero-shot learning to address challenges arising from incomplete and biased training datasets, demonstrating the usage of such models in detecting motorcycles, helmet usage, and occupant positions under varied conditions. We have achieved an average precision of 0.5324 for helmet detection and provided precision-recall curves detailing the detection and classification performance. Despite limitations such as low-resolution data and poor visibility, our research shows promising advancements in automated vehicle safety and traffic safety enforcement systems.</p></details> |  |

However, it has been found that such vision-language models lack the ability to correctly reason over spatial relationships. To tackle this shortcoming, we develop the REVISION framework which improves spatial fidelity in vision-language models. REVISION is a 3D rendering based pipeline that generates spatially accurate synthetic images, given a textual prompt. REVISION is an extendable framework, which currently supports 100+ 3D assets, 11 spatial relationships, all with diverse camera perspectives and backgrounds. Leveraging images from REVISION as additional guidance in a training-free manner consistently improves the spatial consistency of T2I models across all spatial relationships, achieving competitive performance on the VISOR and T2I-CompBench benchmarks. We also design RevQA, a question-answering benchmark to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs, and find that state-of-the-art models are not robust to complex spatial reasoning under adversarial settings. Our results and findings indicate that utilizing rendering-based frameworks is an effective approach for developing spatially-aware generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[ViG-Bias: Visually Grounded Bias Discovery and Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01996v3)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of machine learning models in critical decision making processes has underscored the need for bias discovery and mitigation strategies. Identifying the reasons behind a biased system is not straightforward, since in many occasions they are associated with hidden spurious correlations which are not easy to spot. Standard approaches rely on bias audits performed by analyzing model performance in pre-defined subgroups of data samples, usually characterized by common attributes like gender or ethnicity when it comes to people, or other specific attributes defining semantically coherent groups of images. However, it is not always possible to know a-priori the specific attributes defining the failure modes of visual recognition systems. Recent approaches propose to discover these groups by leveraging large vision language models, which enable the extraction of cross-modal embeddings and the generation of textual descriptions to characterize the subgroups where a certain model is underperforming. In this work, we argue that incorporating visual explanations (e.g. heatmaps generated via GradCAM or other approaches) can boost the performance of such bias discovery and mitigation frameworks. To this end, we introduce Visually Grounded Bias Discovery and Mitigation (ViG-Bias), a simple yet effective technique which can be integrated to a variety of existing frameworks to improve both, discovery and mitigation performance. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that incorporating visual explanations enhances existing techniques like DOMINO, FACTS and Bias-to-Text, across several challenging datasets, including CelebA, Waterbirds, and NICO++.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Self-Introspective Decoding: Alleviating Hallucinations for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02032v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, the prevalent issue known as the `hallucination' problem has emerged as a significant bottleneck, hindering their real-world deployments. Existing methods mitigate this issue mainly from two perspectives: One approach leverages extra knowledge like robust instruction tuning LVLMs with curated datasets or employing auxiliary analysis networks, which inevitable incur additional costs. Another approach, known as contrastive decoding, induces hallucinations by manually disturbing the vision or instruction raw inputs and mitigates them by contrasting the outputs of the disturbed and original LVLMs. However, these approaches rely on empirical holistic input disturbances and double the inference cost. To avoid these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method named Self-Introspective Decoding (SID). Our empirical investigation reveals that pretrained LVLMs can introspectively assess the importance of vision tokens based on preceding vision and text (both instruction and generated) tokens. We develop the Context and Text-aware Token Selection (CT2S) strategy, which preserves only unimportant vision tokens after early layers of LVLMs to adaptively amplify text-informed hallucination during the auto-regressive decoding. This approach ensures that multimodal knowledge absorbed in the early layers induces multimodal contextual rather than aimless hallucinations. Subsequently, the original token logits subtract the amplified vision-and-text association hallucinations, guiding LVLMs decoding faithfully. Extensive experiments illustrate SID generates less-hallucination and higher-quality texts across various metrics, without extra knowledge and much additional computation burdens.</p></details> |  |

While CLIP provides both explainability and zero-shot classification capability, its pre-training on generic image and text data may limit its classification accuracy and applicability to medical image diagnostic tasks, creating a transfer learning problem. To maintain explainability and address transfer learning needs, CBM methods commonly design post-processing modules after the bottleneck module. However, this way has been ineffective. This paper takes an unconventional approach by re-examining the CBM framework through the lens of its geometrical representation as a simple linear classification system. The analysis uncovers that post-CBM fine-tuning modules merely rescale and shift the classification outcome of the system, failing to fully leverage the system's learning potential. We introduce an adaptive module strategically positioned between CLIP and CBM to bridge the gap between source and downstream domains. This simple yet effective approach enhances classification performance while preserving the explainability afforded by the framework. Our work offers a comprehensive solution that encompasses the entire process, from concept discovery to model training, providing a holistic recipe for leveraging the strengths of GPT, CLIP, and CBM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2024, the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention</p></details> |

However, uncertainty about bias has in some cases limited their adoption and availability. In the present work, we study 43 CLIP vision-language models to determine whether they learn human-like facial impression biases, and we find evidence that such biases are reflected across three distinct CLIP model families. We show for the first time that the the degree to which a bias is shared across a society predicts the degree to which it is reflected in a CLIP model. Human-like impressions of visually unobservable attributes, like trustworthiness and sexuality, emerge only in models trained on the largest dataset, indicating that a better fit to uncurated cultural data results in the reproduction of increasingly subtle social biases. Moreover, we use a hierarchical clustering approach to show that dataset size predicts the extent to which the underlying structure of facial impression bias resembles that of facial impression bias in humans. Finally, we show that Stable Diffusion models employing CLIP as a text encoder learn facial impression biases, and that these biases intersect with racial biases in Stable Diffusion XL-Turbo. While pretrained CLIP models may prove useful for scientific studies of bias, they will also require significant dataset curation when intended for use as general-purpose models in a zero-shot setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society 2024</p></details> |

To approach this goal, we leverage a vision-language model (VLM) for visual grounding and transfer its vision-language knowledge into reinforcement learning (RL) for object-centric tasks, which makes the agent capable of zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and instructions. By visual grounding, we obtain an object-grounded confidence map for the target object indicated in the instruction. Based on this map, we introduce two routes to transfer VLM knowledge into RL. Firstly, we propose an object-grounded intrinsic reward function derived from the confidence map to more effectively guide the agent towards the target object. Secondly, the confidence map offers a more unified, accessible task representation for the agent's policy, compared to language embeddings. This enables the agent to process unseen objects and instructions through comprehensible visual confidence maps, facilitating zero-shot object-level generalization. Single-task experiments prove that our intrinsic reward significantly improves performance on challenging skill learning. In multi-task experiments, through testing on tasks beyond the training set, we show that the agent, when provided with the confidence map as the task representation, possesses better generalization capabilities than language-based conditioning.

| **[Consistency-guided Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01195v4)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Consistency-guided Prompt learning (CoPrompt), a new fine-tuning method for vision-language models. Our approach improves the generalization of large foundation models when fine-tuned on downstream tasks in a few-shot setting. The basic idea of CoPrompt is to enforce a consistency constraint in the prediction of the trainable and pre-trained models to prevent overfitting on the downstream task. Additionally, we introduce the following two components into our consistency constraint to further boost the performance: enforcing consistency on two perturbed inputs and combining two dominant paradigms of tuning, prompting and adapter. Enforcing consistency on perturbed input serves to further regularize the consistency constraint, thereby improving generalization. Moreover, the integration of adapters and prompts not only enhances performance on downstream tasks but also offers increased tuning flexibility in both input and output spaces. This facilitates more effective adaptation to downstream tasks in a few-shot learning setting. Experiments show that CoPrompt outperforms existing methods on a range of evaluation suites, including base-to-novel generalization, domain generalization, and cross-dataset evaluation. On generalization, CoPrompt improves the state-of-the-art on zero-shot tasks and the overall harmonic mean over 11 datasets. Detailed ablation studies show the effectiveness of each of the components in CoPrompt. We make our code available at https://github.com/ShuvenduRoy/CoPrompt.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference. 21 pages, 20 figures</p></details> |

To create a high-quality scene, designers usually need to spend hours in software like Blender, in which they might need to interleave and repeat operations, such as connecting material nodes, hundreds of times. Moreover, slightly different design goals may require completely different sequences, making automation difficult. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs), like GPT-4V, to intelligently search the design action space to arrive at an answer that can satisfy a user's intent. Specifically, we design a vision-based edit generator and state evaluator to work together to find the correct sequence of actions to achieve the goal. Inspired by the role of visual imagination in the human design process, we supplement the visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs with "imagined" reference images from image-generation models, providing visual grounding of abstract language descriptions. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence suggesting our system can produce simple but tedious Blender editing sequences for tasks such as editing procedural materials and geometry from text and/or reference images, as well as adjusting lighting configurations for product renderings in complex scenes.</p></details> |  |

This paper assesses the relevance estimation capabilities of VLMs, including CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4V, within a large-scale \textit{ad hoc} retrieval task tailored for multimedia content creation in a zero-shot fashion. Preliminary experiments reveal the following: (1) Both LLaVA and GPT-4V, encompassing open-source and closed-source visual-instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), achieve notable Kendall's $\tau \sim 0.4$ when compared to human relevance judgments, surpassing the CLIPScore metric. (2) While CLIPScore is strongly preferred, LLMs are less biased towards CLIP-based retrieval systems. (3) GPT-4V's score distribution aligns more closely with human judgments than other models, achieving a Cohen's $\kappa$ value of around 0.08, which outperforms CLIPScore at approximately -0.096. These findings underscore the potential of LLM-powered VLMs in enhancing relevance judgments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGIR 2024 LLM4Eval Workshop: https://llm4eval.github.io/papers</p></details> |

LLaVA-Med, a pioneering large language and vision assistant for biomedicine, can perform multi-modal biomedical image and data analysis to provide a natural language interface for radiologists. While it is highly generalizable and works with multi-modal data, it is currently limited by well-known challenges that exist in the large language model space. Hallucinations and imprecision in responses can lead to misdiagnosis which currently hinder the clinical adaptability of VLMs. To create precise, user-friendly models in healthcare, we propose D-Rax -- a domain-specific, conversational, radiologic assistance tool that can be used to gain insights about a particular radiologic image. In this study, we enhance the conversational analysis of chest X-ray (CXR) images to support radiological reporting, offering comprehensive insights from medical imaging and aiding in the formulation of accurate diagnosis. D-Rax is achieved by fine-tuning the LLaVA-Med architecture on our curated enhanced instruction-following data, comprising of images, instructions, as well as disease diagnosis and demographic predictions derived from MIMIC-CXR imaging data, CXR-related visual question answer (VQA) pairs, and predictive outcomes from multiple expert AI models. We observe statistically significant improvement in responses when evaluated for both open and close-ended conversations. Leveraging the power of state-of-the-art diagnostic models combined with VLMs, D-Rax empowers clinicians to interact with medical images using natural language, which could potentially streamline their decision-making process, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and conserve their time.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to the MICCAI 2024 Second International Workshop on Foundation Models for General Medical AI</p></details> |

However, standard multimodal approaches often assume consistent modalities between training and inference, limiting applications in many real-world use cases, as some modalities may not be available during inference. While existing research mitigates this problem through reconstructing the missing modalities, they unavoidably increase unnecessary computational cost, which could be just as critical, especially for large, deployed infrastructures in industry. To this end, we propose a novel guidance network that promotes knowledge sharing during training, taking advantage of the multimodal representations to train better single-modality models to be used for inference. Real-world experiments in violence detection shows that our proposed framework trains single-modality models that significantly outperform traditionally trained counterparts, while avoiding increases in computational cost for inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICME ...</summary><p>ICME 2024 Camera Ready.

Direct inspections and manual annotations are prohibitively expensive at scale. Conventional machine learning methods require substantial annotated training data for adequate performance. In this paper, we consider vision language models as a mechanism for annotating diverse urban features from satellite images, reducing the dependence on human annotation to produce large training sets. While these models have achieved impressive results in describing common objects in images captured from a human perspective, their training sets are less likely to include strong signals for esoteric features in the built environment, and their performance in these settings is therefore unclear. We demonstrate proof-of-concept combining a state-of-the-art vision language model and variants of a prompting strategy that asks the model to consider segmented elements independently of the original image. Experiments on two urban features -- stop lines and raised tables -- show that while direct zero-shot prompting correctly annotates nearly zero images, the pre-segmentation strategies can annotate images with near 40% intersection-over-union accuracy. We describe how these results inform a new research agenda in automatic annotation of the built environment to improve equity, accessibility, and safety at broad scale and in diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we highlight a specific vulnerability in popular models, namely permutation sensitivity in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Specifically, we show empirically that popular models are vulnerable to adversarial permutation in answer sets for multiple-choice prompting, which is surprising as models should ideally be as invariant to prompt permutation as humans are. These vulnerabilities persist across various model sizes, and exist in very recent language and vision-language models.

Traditional 3D iterative-based reconstruction methods suffer from both slow speed and high memory consumption. Recently, in computer graphics, the differentiable rendering has made significant progress, particularly with the rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Inspired by these, we introduce differentiable radiation into PAI, developing a novel reconstruction algorithm: the Sliding Ball Adaptive Growth algorithm (SlingBAG) for 3D PAI, which shows ability in high-quality 3D PAI reconstruction both under extremely sparse view and limited view. We established the point cloud dataset in PAI, and used unique differentiable rapid radiator based on the spherical decomposition strategy and the randomly initialized point cloud adaptively optimized according to sparse sensor data. Each point undergoes updates in 3D coordinates, initial pressure, and resolution (denoted by the radius of ball). Points undergo adaptive growth during iterative process, including point destroying, splitting and duplicating along the gradient of their positions, manifesting the sliding ball effect. Finally, our point cloud to voxel grid shader renders the final reconstruction results. Simulation and in vivo experiments demonstrate that our SlingBAG reconstruction result's SNR can be more than 40 dB under extremely sparse view, while the SNR of traditional back-projection algorithm's result is less than 20 dB. Moreover, the result of SlingBAG's structural similarity to the ground truth is significantly higher, with an SSIM value of 95.6%. Notably, our differentiable rapid radiator can conduct forward PA simulation in homogeneous, non-viscous media substantially faster than current methods that numerically simulate the wave propagation, such as k-Wave. The dataset and all code will be open source.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (1 expert). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical imaging: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures DISTS, FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that the additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively.

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions.

Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible to surpass the acoustic diffraction limit by analyzing fluctuations in a set of photoacoustic images obtained under unknown speckle illumination patterns. Here, we purpose an approach to boost reconstruction fidelity and resolution, while reducing the number of acquired images by utilizing a compressed sensing computational reconstruction framework. The approach takes into account prior knowledge of the system response and sparsity of the target structure. We provide proof of principle experiments of the approach and demonstrate that improved performance is obtained when both speckle fluctuations and object priors are used. We numerically study the expected performance as a function of the measurements signal to noise ratio and sample spatial-sparsity. The presented reconstruction framework can be applied to analyze existing photoacoustic experimental datasets containing dynamic fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

| **[Large Language Models Prompting With Episodic Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07465v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization is essential for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in scenarios of few-shot learning where training examples are incorporated directly into the prompt. Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose FUSE (Flexible Unification of Semantic Embeddings), an inexpensive approach to approximating an adapter layer that maps from one model's textual embedding space to another, even across different tokenizers. We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space. We show the efficacy of our approach via multi-objective optimization over vision-language and causal language models for image captioning and sentiment-based image captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a Conference Paper at COLM 2024; 10 Pages; https://github.com/jnwilliams/FUSE_prompt_inversion.git</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Base Station Siting: Intelligent Deployment based on Prompt or Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03631v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional base station siting (BSS) methods rely heavily on drive testing and user feedback, which are laborious and require extensive expertise in communication, networking, and optimization. As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Dialogue State Tracking via Dual Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21633v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) seeks to enable dialogue systems to transition to unfamiliar domains without manual annotation or extensive retraining. Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings. Our code is accessible at: \url{https://github.com/suntea233/DualLoRA}.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2024 |

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

We present Chemlactica and Chemma, two language models fine-tuned on a novel corpus of 110M molecules with computed properties, totaling 40B tokens.

At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |

One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |
| **[Fine-Tuning and Prompt Optimization: Two Great Steps that Work Better Together](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10930v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly taking the form of multi-stage pipelines involving multiple distinct language models (LMs) and prompting strategies. Here we address the question of how to fine-tune such systems to improve their performance. We cast this as a problem of optimizing the underlying LM weights and the prompting strategies together, and consider a challenging but highly realistic scenario in which we have no gold labels for any intermediate stages in the pipeline. To address this challenge, we evaluate approximate optimization strategies in which we bootstrap training labels for all pipeline stages and use these to optimize the pipeline's prompts and fine-tune its weights alternatingly. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification, we find that simple approaches for optimizing the prompts and weights together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 65% and 5%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks. We will release our new optimizers in DSPy at http://dspy.ai</p></details> |  |

While there has been work on automating prompt engineering, the solutions generally are either tuned to specific tasks with given answers or are quite costly. We introduce GRAD-SUM, a scalable and flexible method for automatic prompt engineering that builds on gradient-based optimization techniques. Our approach incorporates user-defined task descriptions and evaluation criteria, and features a novel gradient summarization module to generalize feedback effectively. Our results demonstrate that GRAD-SUM consistently outperforms existing methods across various benchmarks, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in automatic prompt optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024)</p></details> |

While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we first quantitatively demonstrate that different prompts should be adapted to different LLMs to enhance their capabilities across various downstream tasks in NLP. Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks.

The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08364v3)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization.

| **[LangGPT: Rethinking Structured Reusable Prompt Design Framework for LLMs from the Programming Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16929v2)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have demonstrated commendable performance across diverse domains. Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Prompt Program Search: A Structure-Aware Approach to Efficient Compile-Time Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02319v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many modern LLM applications, such as retrieval augmented generation, prompts have become programs themselves. In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |
| **[LoPT: Low-Rank Prompt Tuning for Parameter Efficient Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19486v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In prompt tuning, a prefix or suffix text is added to the prompt, and the embeddings (soft prompts) or token indices (hard prompts) of the prefix/suffix are optimized to gain more control over language models for specific tasks. This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concentrate Attention: Towards Domain-Generalizable Prompt Optimization for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10584v3)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in prompt optimization have notably enhanced the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks. However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2024, Preprint, Under review</p></details> |
| **[On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01606v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first gradient-based framework for prompt optimization in text-to-image diffusion models. We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

| **[Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10443v2)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-free Prompted Based Anomaly Detection: prompt optimization with Meta-guiding prompt scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18197v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) are highly adaptable to various downstream tasks through few-shot learning, making prompt-based anomaly detection a promising approach. Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11000v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a crucial yet challenging task for optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on customized tasks. This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET), which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts, resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4% increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a significant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16743v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace is the New AutoDiff -- Unlocking Efficient Optimization of Computational Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16218v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. We propose an end-to-end optimization framework, Trace, which treats the computational workflow of an AI system as a graph akin to neural networks, based on a generalization of back-propagation. Optimization of computational workflows often involves rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, hyper-parameters, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). Moreover, its computation graph can change dynamically with the inputs and parameters. We frame a new mathematical setup of iterative optimization, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), to capture and abstract these properties so as to design optimizers that work across many domains. In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. Trace is the tool to implement OPTO in practice. Trace has a Python interface that efficiently converts a computational workflow into an OPTO instance using a PyTorch-like interface. Using Trace, we develop a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime that can effectively solve OPTO problems. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We believe that Trace, OptoPrime and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar selection, ES). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO recently receiving more research attention. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and ES techniques, both isolation and combination, on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars consistently improves performance over IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with ES strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe synergy between ES and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar selection as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remains a crucial aspect of APO and deserves greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04155v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO.

| **[APEER: Automatic Prompt Engineering Enhances Large Language Model Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14449v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced Information Retrieval (IR) across various modules, such as reranking. Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Phase Accelerated Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13443v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-free prompt optimization methods have made significant strides in enhancing the performance of closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. However, existing approaches make light of the importance of high-quality prompt initialization and the identification of effective optimization directions, thus resulting in substantial optimization steps to obtain satisfactory performance. In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> |  |

The method depends on generating synthetic queries for documents using a language model (LM), and the key step is that we automatically optimize the LM prompt that is used to generate these queries based on training quality. In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Instructions and Demonstrations for Multi-Stage Language Model Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11695v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Model Programs, i.e. sophisticated pipelines of modular language model (LM) calls, are increasingly advancing NLP tasks, but they require crafting prompts that are jointly effective for all modules. We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel optimizer that outperforms baselines on five of six diverse LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 12.9% accuracy.

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table (12 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST): Integrating Human Feedback and Heuristic-based Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08702v3)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization aims to find the best prompt to a large language model (LLM) for a given task. LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PROMST that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |
| **[POEM: Interactive Prompt Optimization for Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03843v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive abilities for multimodal content comprehension and reasoning with proper prompting in zero- or few-shot settings. Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights. The effectiveness and efficiency of our system are validated through two case studies and interviews with experts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Batch-Instructed Gradient for Prompt Evolution:Systematic Prompt Optimization for Enhanced Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08713v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images from user-provided prompts. Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[POS: A Prompts Optimization Suite for Augmenting Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00949v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper targets to enhance the diffusion-based text-to-video generation by improving the two input prompts, including the noise and the text. Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptWizard: Task-Aware Agent-driven Prompt Optimization Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18369v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI across diverse domains, showcasing remarkable capabilities. Central to their success is the concept of prompting, which guides model output generation. However, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic, synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. PromptWizard offers several key features and capabilities, including computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, adaptability to scenarios with varying amounts of training data, and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizard's superiority over existing prompt strategies, showcasing its efficacy and scalability in prompt optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |
| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuanWu/EASE-Prompt-Optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 1 figure, 23 tables</p></details> |

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |

However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p></details> | WWW 2024 Companion |

Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts. The reward function during training encourages the model to consider aesthetic score, semantic consistency, and user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively improves the original prompts, generating visually more appealing images while maintaining semantic alignment.

However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference. It demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot question-answering datasets: GSM8K, MultiArith, and AQuA.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Efficient Prompting Methods for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01077v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has become a mainstream paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific natural language processing tasks. While this approach opens the door to in-context learning of LLMs, it brings the additional computational burden of model inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.</p></details> |  |

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

Our work addresses the inherent limitations of conventional single-prompt learning methods that often lead to overfitting due to the inability to generalize across varying contexts in real-world videos. Recognizing the diversity of camera views, backgrounds, and objects in videos, we propose a multi-prompt learning framework enhanced with optimal transport. This design allows the model to learn a set of diverse prompts for each action, capturing general characteristics more effectively and distributing the representation to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, by employing optimal transport theory, we efficiently align these prompts with action features, optimizing for a comprehensive representation that adapts to the multifaceted nature of video data. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in action localization accuracy and robustness in few-shot settings on the standard challenging datasets of THUMOS-14 and EpicKitchens100, highlighting the efficacy of our multi-prompt optimal transport approach in overcoming the challenges of conventional few-shot TAL methods.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17804v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

One approach is to treat these models as black boxes and use forward passes (Inference APIs) to interact with them. Current research focuses on adapting these black-box models to downstream tasks using gradient-free prompt optimization, but this often involves an expensive process of searching task-specific prompts. Therefore, we are motivated to study black-box language model adaptation without prompt search. Specifically, we introduce a label-enhanced cross-attention network called CrossTune, which models the semantic relatedness between the input text sequence and task-specific label descriptions. Its effectiveness is examined in the context of few-shot text classification. To improve the generalization of CrossTune, we utilize ChatGPT to generate additional training data through in-context learning. A switch mechanism is implemented to exclude low-quality ChatGPT-generated data. Through extensive experiments on seven benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art gradient-free black-box tuning method by 5.7% on average. Even without using ChatGPT-augmented data, CrossTune performs better or comparably than previous black-box tuning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-Coling 2024</p></details> |
| **[BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11273v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image models with 3D representation methods, e.g., Gaussian Splatting (GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts.

Existing methods follow two main paradigms to collect evidence: (1) The \textit{retrieve-then-read} paradigm retrieves pertinent documents from an external corpus; and (2) the \textit{generate-then-read} paradigm employs large language models (LLMs) to generate relevant documents. However, neither can fully address multifaceted requirements for evidence. To this end, we propose LLMQA, a generalized framework that formulates the ODQA process into three basic steps: query expansion, document selection, and answer generation, combining the superiority of both retrieval-based and generation-based evidence. Since LLMs exhibit their excellent capabilities to accomplish various tasks, we instruct LLMs to play multiple roles as generators, rerankers, and evaluators within our framework, integrating them to collaborate in the ODQA process. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt optimization algorithm to refine role-playing prompts and steer LLMs to produce higher-quality evidence and answers. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks (NQ, WebQ, and TriviaQA) demonstrate that LLMQA achieves the best performance in terms of both answer accuracy and evidence quality, showcasing its potential for advancing ODQA research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>TheWe...</summary><p>TheWebConf 2024 (WWW 2024) oral, code repo: https://github.com/EthanLeo-LYX/LLMQA</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce ConstitutionalExperts, a method for learning a prompt consisting of constitutional principles (i.e. rules), given a training dataset. Unlike prior methods that optimize the prompt as a single entity, our method incrementally improves the prompt by surgically editing individual principles. We also show that we can improve overall performance by learning unique prompts for different semantic regions of the training data and using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to route inputs at inference time. We compare our method to other state of the art prompt-optimization techniques across six benchmark datasets. We also investigate whether MoE improves these other techniques. Our results suggest that ConstitutionalExperts outperforms other prompt optimization techniques by 10.9% (F1) and that mixture-of-experts improves all techniques, suggesting its broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Dependent Prompt Evaluation and Optimization with Offline Inverse RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06553v4)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we aim to enhance the arithmetic reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through zero-shot prompt optimization. We identify a previously overlooked objective of query dependency in such optimization and elucidate two ensuing challenges that impede the successful and economical design of prompt optimization techniques. One primary issue is the absence of an effective method to evaluate prompts during inference when the golden answer is unavailable. Concurrently, learning via interactions with the LLMs to navigate the expansive natural language prompting space proves to be resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce Prompt-OIRL, which harnesses offline inverse reinforcement learning to draw insights from offline prompting demonstration data. Such data exists as by-products when diverse prompts are benchmarked on open-accessible datasets. With Prompt-OIRL, the query-dependent prompt optimization objective is achieved by first learning an offline reward model. This model can evaluate any query-prompt pairs without accessing LLMs. Subsequently, a best-of-N strategy is deployed to recommend the optimal prompt. Our experimental evaluations across various LLM scales and arithmetic reasoning datasets underscore both the efficacy and economic viability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02993v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating natural language has aroused a wide interest in developing prompt-based methods to harness the power of black-box LLMs. Existing methodologies usually prioritize a global optimization for finding the global optimum, which however will perform poorly in certain tasks. This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimization (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connecting Large Language Models with Evolutionary Algorithms Yields Powerful Prompt Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08532v2)** | 2024-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10949v2)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and basic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating "positive thinking" into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of "positive thinking" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best "positive thinking" prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A User-Friendly Framework for Generating Model-Preferred Prompts in Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12760v1)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Well-designed prompts have demonstrated the potential to guide text-to-image models in generating amazing images. Although existing prompt engineering methods can provide high-level guidance, it is challenging for novice users to achieve the desired results by manually entering prompts due to a discrepancy between novice-user-input prompts and the model-preferred prompts. To bridge the distribution gap between user input behavior and model training datasets, we first construct a novel Coarse-Fine Granularity Prompts dataset (CFP) and propose a novel User-Friendly Fine-Grained Text Generation framework (UF-FGTG) for automated prompt optimization. For CFP, we construct a novel dataset for text-to-image tasks that combines coarse and fine-grained prompts to facilitate the development of automated prompt generation methods. For UF-FGTG, we propose a novel framework that automatically translates user-input prompts into model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we propose a prompt refiner that continually rewrites prompts to empower users to select results that align with their unique needs. Meanwhile, we integrate image-related loss functions from the text-to-image model into the training process of text generation to generate model-preferred prompts. Additionally, we propose an adaptive feature extraction module to ensure diversity in the generated results. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of generating more visually appealing and diverse images than previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 5% across six quality and aesthetic metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024)</p></details> |
| **[MORL-Prompt: An Empirical Analysis of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Discrete Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11711v1)** | 2024-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RL-based techniques can be used to search for prompts that when fed into a target language model maximize a set of user-specified reward functions. However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we adapt several techniques for multi-objective optimization to RL-based discrete prompt optimization -- two that consider volume of the Pareto reward surface, and another that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We conduct an empirical analysis of these methods on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize volume perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhaseEvo: Towards Unified In-Context Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11347v1)** | 2024-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crafting an ideal prompt for Large Language Models (LLMs) is a challenging task that demands significant resources and expert human input. Existing work treats the optimization of prompt instruction and in-context learning examples as distinct problems, leading to sub-optimal prompt performance. This research addresses this limitation by establishing a unified in-context prompt optimization framework, which aims to achieve joint optimization of the prompt instruction and examples. However, formulating such optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional natural language space introduces challenges in terms of convergence and computational efficiency. To overcome these issues, we present PhaseEvo, an efficient automatic prompt optimization framework that combines the generative capability of LLMs with the global search proficiency of evolution algorithms. Our framework features a multi-phase design incorporating innovative LLM-based mutation operators to enhance search efficiency and accelerate convergence. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our approach across 35 benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that PhaseEvo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods by a large margin whilst maintaining good efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 9 figures, 26 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Rewrite Prompts for Personalized Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00152v2)** | 2024-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facilitated by large language models (LLMs), personalized text generation has become a rapidly growing research direction. Most existing studies focus on designing specialized models for a particular domain, or they require fine-tuning the LLMs to generate personalized text. We consider a typical scenario in which the large language model, which generates personalized output, is frozen and can only be accessed through APIs. Under this constraint, all one can do is to improve the input text (i.e., text prompts) sent to the LLM, a procedure that is usually done manually. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically revise prompts for personalized text generation. The proposed method takes the initial prompts generated by a state-of-the-art, multistage framework for personalized generation and rewrites a few critical components that summarize and synthesize the personal context. The prompt rewriter employs a training paradigm that chains together supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL), where SL reduces the search space of RL and RL facilitates end-to-end training of the rewriter. Using datasets from three representative domains, we demonstrate that the rewritten prompts outperform both the original prompts and the prompts optimized via supervised learning or reinforcement learning alone. In-depth analysis of the rewritten prompts shows that they are not only human readable, but also able to guide manual revision of prompts when there is limited resource to employ reinforcement learning to train the prompt rewriter, or when it is costly to deploy an automatic prompt rewriter for inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |
| **[Intent-based Prompt Calibration: Enhancing prompt optimization with synthetic boundary cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03099v1)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a challenging and important task due to the high sensitivity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the given prompt and the inherent ambiguity of a textual task instruction. Automatic prompt engineering is essential to achieve optimized performance from LLMs. Recent studies have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs to automatically conduct prompt engineering by employing a meta-prompt that incorporates the outcomes of the last trials and proposes an improved prompt. However, this requires a high-quality benchmark to compare different prompts, which is difficult and expensive to acquire in many real-world use cases. In this work, we introduce a new method for automatic prompt engineering, using a calibration process that iteratively refines the prompt to the user intent. During the optimization process, the system jointly generates synthetic data of boundary use cases and optimizes the prompt according to the generated dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with respect to strong proprietary models on real-world tasks such as moderation and generation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a limited number of annotated samples. Furthermore, we validate the advantages of each one of the system's key components. Our system is built in a modular way, facilitating easy adaptation to other tasks. The code is available $\href{https://github.com/Eladlev/AutoPrompt}{here}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models Against Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13954v3)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant ability in various Natural Language Processing tasks. However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on the phrasing of the task prompt, leading to research on automatic prompt optimization using labeled task data. We reveal that these prompt optimization techniques are vulnerable to distribution shifts such as subpopulation shifts, which are common for LLMs in real-world scenarios such as customer reviews analysis. In this light, we propose a new problem of robust prompt optimization for LLMs against distribution shifts, which requires the prompt optimized over the labeled source group can simultaneously generalize to an unlabeled target group. To solve this problem, we propose Generalized Prompt Optimization framework, which incorporates the unlabeled data from the target group into prompt optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with significant performance improvement on the target group and comparable performance on the source group.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 Main |
| **[GLaPE: Gold Label-agnostic Prompt Evaluation and Optimization for Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02408v1)** | 2024-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), their task performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/thunderous77/GLaPE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Good Prompt Optimizers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02101v1)** | 2024-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based Automatic Prompt Optimization, which typically utilizes LLMs as Prompt Optimizers to self-reflect and refine prompts, has shown promising performance in recent studies. Despite the success, the underlying mechanism of this approach remains unexplored, and the true effectiveness of LLMs as Prompt Optimizers requires further validation. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study to uncover the actual mechanism of LLM-based Prompt Optimization. Our findings reveal that the LLM optimizers struggle to identify the true causes of errors during reflection, tending to be biased by their own prior knowledge rather than genuinely reflecting on the errors. Furthermore, even when the reflection is semantically valid, the LLM optimizers often fail to generate appropriate prompts for the target models with a single prompt refinement step, partly due to the unpredictable behaviors of the target models. Based on the observations, we introduce a new "Automatic Behavior Optimization" paradigm, which directly optimizes the target model's behavior in a more controllable manner. We hope our study can inspire new directions for automatic prompt optimization development.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods heavily rely on per-prompt optimization when handling natural language as editing instructions. Due to the lack of labeled human face 3D datasets and effective architectures, the area of human-instructed 3D-aware editing for open-world portraits in an end-to-end manner remains under-explored. To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end diffusion-based framework termed InstructPix2NeRF, which enables instructed 3D-aware portrait editing from a single open-world image with human instructions. At its core lies a conditional latent 3D diffusion process that lifts 2D editing to 3D space by learning the correlation between the paired images' difference and the instructions via triplet data. With the help of our proposed token position randomization strategy, we could even achieve multi-semantic editing through one single pass with the portrait identity well-preserved. Besides, we further propose an identity consistency module that directly modulates the extracted identity signals into our diffusion process, which increases the multi-view 3D identity consistency. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and show its superiority against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively.

In contrast to existing text-to-3D methods that often entail time-consuming per-prompt optimization and commonly output representations other than polygonal meshes, AToM directly generates high-quality textured meshes in less than 1 second with around 10 times reduction in the training cost, and generalizes to unseen prompts. Our key idea is a novel triplane-based text-to-mesh architecture with a two-stage amortized optimization strategy that ensures stable training and enables scalability. Through extensive experiments on various prompt benchmarks, AToM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art amortized approaches with over 4 times higher accuracy (in DF415 dataset) and produces more distinguishable and higher-quality 3D outputs. AToM demonstrates strong generalizability, offering finegrained 3D assets for unseen interpolated prompts without further optimization during inference, unlike per-prompt solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages with appendix and references.

However, dreaming has not been successfully applied to language models because the input space is discrete. We extend Greedy Coordinate Gradient, a method from the language model adversarial attack literature, to design the Evolutionary Prompt Optimization (EPO) algorithm. EPO optimizes the input prompt to simultaneously maximize the Pareto frontier between a chosen internal feature and prompt fluency, enabling fluent dreaming for language models. We demonstrate dreaming with neurons, output logits and arbitrary directions in activation space. We measure the fluency of the resulting prompts and compare language model dreaming with max-activating dataset examples. Critically, fluent dreaming allows automatically exploring the behavior of model internals in reaction to mildly out-of-distribution prompts.

However, prior discrete prompt optimization methods require expert knowledge to design the base prompt set and identify high-quality prompts, which is costly, inefficient, and subjective. Meanwhile, existing continuous prompt optimization methods improve the performance by learning the ideal prompts through the gradient information of PLMs, whose high computational cost, and low readability and generalizability are often concerning. To address the research gap, we propose a Dialogue-comprised Policy-gradient-based Discrete Prompt Optimization ($DP_2O$) method. We first design a multi-round dialogue alignment strategy for readability prompt set generation based on GPT-4. Furthermore, we propose an efficient prompt screening metric to identify high-quality prompts with linear complexity. Finally, we construct a reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on policy gradients to match the prompts to inputs optimally. By training a policy network with only 0.67% of the PLM parameter size on the tasks in the few-shot setting, $DP_2O$ outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.52% in accuracy on average on four open-source datasets. Moreover, subsequent experiments also demonstrate that $DP_2O$ has good universality, robustness, and generalization ability.</p></details> | AAAI 2024 Main Track |

Typically, they learn a very small scale of parameters for pre-trained models in a white-box formulation, which assumes model architectures to be known and parameters to be accessible. However, large models are often not open-source due to considerations of preventing abuse or commercial factors, hence posing a barrier to the deployment of white-box PEFT methods. To alleviate the dependence on model accessibility, we introduce collaborative black-box tuning (CBBT) for both textual prompt optimization and output feature adaptation for black-box models. Specifically, considering that the backpropagation gradients are blocked, we approximate the gradients of textual prompts by analyzing the predictions with perturbed prompts. Secondly, a lightweight adapter is deployed over the output feature of the inaccessible model, further facilitating the model adaptation process. Empowered with these designs, our CBBT is extensively evaluated on eleven downstream benchmarks and achieves remarkable improvements compared to existing black-box VL adaptation methods.

In this work, we propose UniDCP, a Unified medical vision-language model with Dynamic Cross-modal learnable Prompts, which can be plastically applied to multiple medical vision-language tasks. Specifically, we explicitly construct a unified framework to harmonize diverse inputs from multiple pretraining tasks by leveraging cross-modal prompts for unification, which accordingly can accommodate heterogeneous medical fine-tuning tasks. Furthermore, we conceive a dynamic cross-modal prompt optimizing strategy that optimizes the prompts within the shareable space for implicitly processing the shareable clinic knowledge. UniDCP is the first Med-VLP model capable of performing all 8 medical uni-modal and cross-modal tasks over 14 corresponding datasets, consistently yielding superior results over diverse state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, automating the generation of such expert-level prompts remains elusive. Existing prompt optimization methods tend to overlook the depth of domain knowledge and struggle to efficiently explore the vast space of expert-level prompts. Addressing this, we present PromptAgent, an optimization method that autonomously crafts prompts equivalent in quality to those handcrafted by experts. At its core, PromptAgent views prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem and employs a principled planning algorithm, rooted in Monte Carlo tree search, to strategically navigate the expert-level prompt space. Inspired by human-like trial-and-error exploration, PromptAgent induces precise expert-level insights and in-depth instructions by reflecting on model errors and generating constructive error feedback. Such a novel framework allows the agent to iteratively examine intermediate prompts (states), refine them based on error feedbacks (actions), simulate future rewards, and search for high-reward paths leading to expert prompts. We apply PromptAgent to 12 tasks spanning three practical domains: BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), as well as domain-specific and general NLP tasks, showing it significantly outperforms strong Chain-of-Thought and recent prompt optimization baselines. Extensive analyses emphasize its capability to craft expert-level, detailed, and domain-insightful prompts with great efficiency and generalizability.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |

Traditional approaches, however, face limitations due to their presumption of a uniform number of intents across all sessions. This assumption overlooks the dynamic nature of user sessions, where the number and type of intentions can significantly vary. In addition, these methods typically operate in latent spaces, thus hinder the model's transparency.Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel ISR approach, utilizing the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). First, this approach begins by generating an initial prompt that guides LLMs to predict the next item in a session, based on the varied intents manifested in user sessions. Then, to refine this process, we introduce an innovative prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively self-reflects and adjusts prompts. Furthermore, our prompt selection module, built upon the LLMs' broad adaptability, swiftly selects the most optimized prompts across diverse domains. This new paradigm empowers LLMs to discern diverse user intents at a semantic level, leading to more accurate and interpretable session recommendations. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, marking a significant advancement in ISR systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous diffusion-CLIP-based pipelines that involve tedious per-prompt optimizations, Prompt2NeRF-PIL is capable of generating a variety of 3D objects with a single forward pass, leveraging a pre-trained implicit latent space of NeRF parameters. Furthermore, in zero-shot tasks, our experiments demonstrate that the NeRFs produced by our method serve as semantically informative initializations, significantly accelerating the inference process of existing prompt-to-NeRF methods. Specifically, we will show that our approach speeds up the text-to-NeRF model DreamFusion and the 3D reconstruction speed of the image-to-NeRF method Zero-1-to-3 by 3 to 5 times.</p></details> |  |

A Survey on Factual Knowledge Probing in Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16570v2)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on vast unlabeled data, rich in world knowledge. This fact has sparked the interest of the community in quantifying the amount of factual knowledge present in PLMs, as this explains their performance on downstream tasks, and potentially justifies their use as knowledge bases. In this work, we survey methods and datasets that are used to probe PLMs for factual knowledge. Our contributions are: (1) We propose a categorization scheme for factual probing methods that is based on how their inputs, outputs and the probed PLMs are adapted; (2) We provide an overview of the datasets used for factual probing; (3) We synthesize insights about knowledge retention and prompt optimization in PLMs, analyze obstacles to adopting PLMs as knowledge bases and outline directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP Findings 2023</p></details> |
| **[Joint Prompt Optimization of Stacked LLMs using Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12509v2)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can be seen as atomic units of computation mapping sequences to a distribution over sequences. Thus, they can be seen as stochastic language layers in a language network, where the learnable parameters are the natural language prompts at each layer. By stacking two such layers and feeding the output of one layer to the next, we obtain a Deep Language Network (DLN). We first show how to effectively perform prompt optimization for a 1-Layer language network (DLN-1). Then, we present an extension that applies to 2-layer DLNs (DLN-2), where two prompts must be learned. The key idea is to consider the output of the first layer as a latent variable, which requires inference, and prompts to be learned as the parameters of the generative distribution. We first test the effectiveness of DLN-1 in multiple reasoning and natural language understanding tasks. Then, we show that DLN-2 can reach higher performance than a single layer, showing promise that we might reach comparable performance to GPT-4, even when each LLM in the network is smaller and less powerful.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2023 |
