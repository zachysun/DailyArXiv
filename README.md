Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for arbitrary time-point sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (poster).

| **[Detecting sub-populations in online health communities: A mixed-methods exploration of breastfeeding messages in BabyCenter Birth Clubs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23692v2)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.23692v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parental stress is a nationwide health crisis according to the U.S. Surgeon General's 2024 advisory. To allay stress, expecting parents seek advice and share experiences in a variety of venues, from in-person birth education classes and parenting groups to virtual communities, for example, BabyCenter, a moderated online forum community with over 4 million members in the United States alone. In this study, we aim to understand how parents talk about pregnancy, birth, and parenting by analyzing 5.43M posts and comments from the April 2017--January 2024 cohort of 331,843 BabyCenter "birth club" users (that is, users who participate in due date forums or "birth clubs" based on their babies' due dates). Using BERTopic to locate breastfeeding threads and LDA to summarize themes, we compare documents in breastfeeding threads to all other birth-club content. Analyzing time series of word rank, we find that posts and comments containing anxiety-related terms increased steadily from April 2017 to January 2024. We used an ensemble of topic models to identify dominant breastfeeding topics within birth clubs, and then explored trends among all user content versus those who posted in threads related to breastfeeding topics. We conducted Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify the most common topics in the full population, as well as within the subset breastfeeding population. We find that the topic of sleep dominates in content generated by the breastfeeding population, as well anxiety-related and work/daycare topics that are not predominant in the full BabyCenter birth club dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convolutional Spiking-based GRU Cell for Spatio-temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25696v1)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.25696v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks, gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however, traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences. Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS, SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher efficiency compared to SpikGRU.

| **[PyDPF: A Python Package for Differentiable Particle Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25693v1)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.25693v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 0 figures, under review at the Journal of Statistical Software, the python package can be found at https://pypi.org/project/pydpf/ , the full documentation at https://python-dpf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#documentation-index , and the source code including experiments and replication material at https://github.com/John-JoB/pydpf</p></details> |
| **[Quantizing Space and Time: Fusing Time Series and Images for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23118v3)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.23118v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6% in R^2 and 2% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50% in R^2 and 12% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and weights will be released under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Interventions on Deep Networks for Causal Discovery in Subsystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23906v2)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.23906v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models, combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and climate science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Access.

This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference. We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code, providing a reproducible foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 18 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Recurrent Ensembles for Predicting Brain Responses to Naturalistic Movies (Algonauts 2025)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17897v4)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.17897v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[Enlightenment Period Improving DNN Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01737v2)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.01737v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The start of deep neural network training is characterized by a brief yet critical phase that lasts from the beginning of the training until the accuracy reaches approximately 50\%. During this phase, disordered representations rapidly transition toward ordered structure, and we term this phase the Enlightenment Period. Through theoretical modeling based on phase transition theory and experimental validation, we reveal that applying Mixup data augmentation during this phase has a dual effect: it introduces a Gradient Interference Effect that hinders performance, while also providing a beneficial Activation Revival Effect to restore gradient updates for saturated neurons. We further demonstrate that this negative interference diminishes as the sample set size or the model parameter size increases, thereby shifting the balance between these two effects. Based on these findings, we propose three strategies that improve performance by solely adjusting the training data distribution within this brief period: the Mixup Pause Strategy for small-scale scenarios, the Alpha Boost Strategy for large-scale scenarios with underfitting, and the High-Loss Removal Strategy for tasks where Mixup is inapplicable (e.g., time series and large language models). Extensive experiments show that these strategies achieve superior performance across diverse architectures such as ViT and ResNet on datasets including CIFAR and ImageNet-1K. Ultimately, this work offers a novel perspective on enhancing model performance by strategically capitalizing on the dynamics of the brief and crucial early stages of training.

| **[NeuroPathNet: Dynamic Path Trajectory Learning for Brain Functional Connectivity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24025v2)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.24025v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Learning for Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25207v1)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.25207v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF). However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and (2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[State Space and Self-Attention Collaborative Network with Feature Aggregation for DOA Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25193v1)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.25193v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to conventional architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning through Change Point Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24988v1)** | 2025-10-28 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.24988v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD) module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns, and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Expressivity and Scalability with Adaptive Unitary SSMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05238v2)** | 2025-10-28 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.05238v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has revealed that state space models (SSMs), while efficient for long-sequence processing, are fundamentally limited in their ability to represent formal languages-particularly due to time-invariant and real-valued recurrence structures. In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM), a novel class of SSMs that leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at finite precision, enabling AUSSM to model a broad class of regular languages out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training. Empirically, we show that AUSSM and its hybrid variant-interleaved with Mamba-outperform prior SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence modeling.

GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable, domain-aligned explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2505.19193</p></details> |
| **[Causal Ordering for Structure Learning From Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24639v1)** | 2025-10-28 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.24639v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods. Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph $F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery.</p></details> | 32 pages |

Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</p></details> |  |
| **[DistDF: Time-Series Forecasting Needs Joint-Distribution Wasserstein Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24574v1)** | 2025-10-28 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.24574v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training. Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance.

Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.</p></details> |  |

The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper.

Two unique challenges stand out: (1) efficiently and accurately forecasting time series or detecting anomalies in large volumes automatically; and (2) ensuring interpretability of results to effectively incorporate business insights. We present ARIMA_PLUS, a novel framework to overcome these two challenges by a unique combination of (a) accurate and interpretable time series models and (b) scalable and fully managed system infrastructure. The model has a sequential and modular structure to handle different components of the time series, including holiday effects, seasonality, trend, and anomalies, which enables high interpretability of the results. Novel enhancements are made to each module, and a unified framework is established to address both forecasting and anomaly detection tasks simultaneously. In terms of accuracy, its comprehensive benchmark on the 42 public datasets in the Monash forecasting repository shows superior performance over not only well-established statistical alternatives (such as ETS, ARIMA, TBATS, Prophet) but also newer neural network models (such as DeepAR, N-BEATS, PatchTST, TimeMixer). In terms of infrastructure, it is directly built into the query engine of BigQuery in Google Cloud. It uses a simple SQL interface and automates tedious technicalities such as data cleaning and model selection. It automatically scales with managed cloud computational and storage resources, making it possible to forecast 100 million time series using only 1.5 hours with a throughput of more than 18000 time series per second.

| **[50 Years of Water Body Monitoring: The Case of Qaraaoun Reservoir, Lebanon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24413v1)** | 2025-10-28 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.24413v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation, and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate change and environmental patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate, contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods, created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models into clinical practice.</p></details> | Preprint |

We demonstrate that, once trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly, offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems. Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 19 figures, Under review</p></details> |

While the challenges of estimating transfer entropy for continuous data are well known, it has two major shortcomings for data of finite cardinality: it exhibits a substantial positive bias for sparse bin counts, and it has no clear means to assess statistical significance. By computing information content in finite data streams without explicitly considering symbols as instances of random variables, we derive a transfer entropy measure which is asymptotically equivalent to the standard plug-in estimator but remedies these issues for time series of small size and/or high cardinality, permitting a fully nonparametric assessment of statistical significance without simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneCast: Structured Decomposition and Modular Generation for Cross-Domain Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24028v1)** | 2025-10-28 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.24028v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways. Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions. In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

It has important applications in spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$ variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects $m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2) prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and model optimization.</p></details> | In submission |

These data were subsequently used to train and evaluate an Echo State Network (ESN), which successfully reproduced the system's dynamic behavior.

In this paper, we analyze the scheduling and placement of virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud platform of SAP, the world's largest enterprise resource planning software vendor. Based on data from roughly 1,800 hypervisors and 48,000 VMs within a 30-day observation period, we highlight potential improvements for workload management. The data was measured through observability tooling that tracks resource usage and performance metrics across the entire infrastructure. In contrast to existing datasets, ours uniquely offers fine-grained time-series telemetry data of fully virtualized enterprise-level workloads from both long-running and memory-intensive SAP S/4HANA and diverse, general-purpose applications. Our key findings include several suboptimal scheduling situations, such as CPU resource contention exceeding 40%, CPU ready times of up to 220 seconds, significantly imbalanced compute hosts with a maximum CPU~utilization on intra-building block hosts of up to 99%, and overprovisioned CPU and memory resources resulting into over 80% of VMs using less than 70% of the provided resources. Bolstered by these findings, we derive requirements for the design and implementation of novel placement and scheduling algorithms and provide guidance to optimize resource allocations. We make the full dataset used in this study publicly available to enable data-driven evaluations of scheduling approaches for large-scale cloud infrastructures in future research.</p></details> | 15 pages |

In anomaly detection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data points. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single, user-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for the complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we introduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly Detection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find novelties. Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different geometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance metrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score that is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this multi-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery on astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection -- anomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other state-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes discovered. For rare in-distribution anomaly detection, DiMMAD performs similarly to other methods, but may allow for improved interpretability. All our code is open source: DiMMAD is implemented within DistClassiPy: https://github.com/sidchaini/distclassipy/, while all code to reproduce the results of this paper is available here: https://github.com/sidchaini/dimmad/.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, Accepted at the 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences (ML4PS) workshop at NeurIPS</p></details> |

To overcome the limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system prediction.</p></details> | 9 pages,7 figures |

However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid, by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM demonstrated even better results by repurposing a Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.</p></details> |  |

While most forecasting literature assumes regularly spaced observations without missing values, many real-world datasets - particularly in healthcare, climate research, and biomechanics - violate these assumptions. Time Series (TS)-mixer models have achieved remarkable success in regular multivariate time series forecasting. However, they remain unexplored for IMTS due to their requirement for complete and evenly spaced observations. To bridge this gap, we introduce IMTS-Mixer, a novel forecasting architecture designed specifically for IMTS. Our approach retains the core principles of TS mixer models while introducing innovative methods to transform IMTS into fixed-size matrix representations, enabling their seamless integration with mixer modules. We evaluate IMTS-Mixer on a benchmark of four real-world datasets from various domains. Our results demonstrate that IMTS-Mixer establishes a new state-of-the-art in forecasting accuracy while also improving computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited. Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index), that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are inaccessible with traditional measures.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep learning models face significant challenges of high computational cost and insufficient interpretability due to their complex black-box nature. This paper introduces FlightKooba, a novel modeling approach designed to extract such underlying dynamics analytically. Our framework uniquely integrates HiPPO theory, Koopman operator theory, and control theory. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, it constructs Koopman operators analytically, thereby avoiding large-scale parameter training. The method's core strengths lie in its exceptional computational efficiency and inherent interpretability. Experiments on multiple public datasets validate our design philosophy: for signals exhibiting strong periodicity or clear physical laws (e.g., in aviation, meteorology, and traffic flow), FlightKooba delivers competitive prediction accuracy while reducing trainable parameters by several orders of magnitude and achieving the fastest training speed. Furthermore, we analyze the model's theoretical boundaries, clarifying its inherent low-pass filtering characteristics that render it unsuitable for sequences dominated by high-frequency noise. In summary, FlightKooba offers a powerful, efficient, and interpretable new alternative for time series analysis, particularly in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2: Major revision of the manuscript to refine the narrative, clarify the model's theoretical limitations and application scope, and improve overall presentation for journal submission</p></details> |

Furthermore, sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier: quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less reliant on intensive computations. We introduce Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in classification and detection tasks. EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from Reservoir Computing to create a fixed-size window distributed memory system. Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our approach leverages reservoirs (random recurrent networks) as a lightweight and efficient memory. Our architecture integrates a new module called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent working memory units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical reservoir hyperparameters, controlling the dynamics, are now trained. Thus, the EST dynamically adapts the reservoir memory/non-linearity trade-off. Thanks to these working memory units, EST achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. We evaluate ESTs on a recent challenging timeseries benchmark: the Time Series Library, which comprises 69 tasks across five categories. Results show that ESTs ranks first overall in two of five categories, outperforming strong state-of-the-art baselines on classification and anomaly detection tasks, while remaining competitive on short-term forecasting. These results position ESTs as a compelling alternative for time-series classification and anomaly detection, and a practical complement to transformer-style models in applications that prioritize robust representations and sensitive event detection.</p></details> |  |

Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to 2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving cumulative returns by 18.5%. Moreover, IKNet enhances transparency by offering contextualized explanations of volatility events driven by public sentiment.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in long-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and statistical consistency of the detection tests, allowing regulators to temporally verify alarm correctness without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model selection.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

We introduce the Self-Correction with Adaptive Mask (SCAM), which discards overfitted components and selectively replaces them with pseudo labels generated from reconstructions. Additionally, we incorporate Spectral Norm Regularization (SNR) to further suppress overfitting from a loss landscape perspective. Our experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that SCAM consistently improves the performance of various backbone models. This work offers a new perspective on constructing datasets and enhancing the generalization of TSF models through self-supervised learning.

However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new perspective on the design of time series loss functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection, diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability, provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency. Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty, the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making, offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.</p></details> | 117 pages |
| **[DQS: A Low-Budget Query Strategy for Enhancing Unsupervised Data-driven Anomaly Detection Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05663v3)** | 2025-10-26 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.05663v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an active learning-based threshold is recommended.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Big Data</p></details> |

However, single model approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research.

Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies: (i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ab...</summary><p>An abridged version of this paper will be presented at and appear in the Proceedings of ACM IKDD CODS 2025</p></details> |

This synthetic data can be used to supplement historical data to train large trading models. The state-of-the-art models for the generative application often rely on huge amounts of historical data and large, complicated models. These models range from autoregressive and diffusion-based models through to architecturally simpler models such as the temporal-attention bilinear layer. Agent-based approaches to modelling limit order book dynamics can also recreate trading activity through mechanistic models of trader behaviours. In this work, we demonstrate how a popular agent-based framework for simulating intraday trading activity, the Chiarella model, can be combined with one of the most performant deep learning models for forecasting multi-variate time series, the TABL model. This forecasting model is coupled to a simulation of a matching engine with a novel method for simulating deleted order flow. Our simulator gives us the ability to test the generative abilities of the forecasting model using stylised facts. Our results show that this methodology generates realistic price dynamics however, when analysing deeper, parts of the markets microstructure are not accurately recreated, highlighting the necessity for including more sophisticated agent behaviors into the modeling framework to help account for tail events.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to the Workshop on AI in Finance at ECAI2025</p></details> |

Most SSL approaches rely on strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches.

Existing unsupervised methods assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its strong generalizability.</p></details> |  |

These properties place the latter in the statistical regimes made famous and popularized more than 20 years ago by B.~Mandelbrot. Yet forecasting such time series with modern-day AI architectures remains underexplored. We introduce NetBurst, an event-centric framework that reformulates forecasting as predicting when bursts occur and how large they are, using quantile-based codebooks and dual autoregressors. Across large-scale sets of production network telemetry time series and compared to strong baselines, such as Chronos, NetBurst reduces Mean Average Scaled Error (MASE) by 13--605x on service-level time series while preserving burstiness and producing embeddings that cluster 5x more cleanly than Chronos. In effect, our work highlights the benefits that modern AI can reap from leveraging Mandelbrot's pioneering studies for forecasting in bursty, intermittent, and heavy-tailed regimes, where its operational value for high-stakes decision making is of paramount interest.</p></details> |  |

The monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models (TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow-prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement-continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.</p></details> |  |

Although these models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in reconstructing gene regulatory networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,3 figures, conference</p></details> |

Current approaches to monitor satellite behaviors rely on expert knowledge and rule-based systems that scale poorly. Among essential monitoring tasks, satellite pattern-of-life (PoL) identification, analyzing behaviors like station-keeping maneuvers and drift operations, remains underdeveloped due to aerospace system complexity, operational variability, and inconsistent ephemerides sources. We propose a novel generative approach for satellite PoL identification that significantly eliminates the dependence on expert knowledge. The proposed approach leverages orbital elements and positional data to enable automatic pattern discovery directly from observations. Our implementation uses a diffusion model framework for end-to-end identification without manual refinement or domain expertise. The architecture combines a multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data with a conditional denoising process to generate accurate PoL classifications. Through experiments across diverse real-world satellite operational scenarios, our approach demonstrates superior identification quality and robustness across varying data quality characteristics. A case study using actual satellite data confirms the approach's transformative potential for operational behavior pattern identification, enhanced tracking, and space situational awareness.</p></details> |  |

Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.</p></details> |  |

Although numerous time series classification methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE) methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency. At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework, which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and causal fidelity of time series explanations.</p></details> |  |

While real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings, primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention. Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

Building on these representations, we introduce a new persistence of excitation condition tailored to the model class of affine time-invariant systems. The condition yields a new fundamental lemma that parallels the classical result for linear systems while provably reducing data requirements.

Forecasting the probability distribution of peak demand on shorter timescales is a critical forward-facing issue under increasing volatility. This study introduces a novel ensemble-based machine learning method for peak demand probability density forecasting that extends classical extreme value theory to model time series peaks as nonstationary statistical distributions. The approach employs an ensemble of tree-based learners that recursively partition the covariate space and estimate local generalized extreme value distributions, allowing it to automatically capture complex covariate-dependent parameter variations. Unlike existing approaches, which often suffer from convergence issues or restrictive functional forms, this framework is both flexible and robust. Validation on a case study based on the PJM interconnection demonstrates that the method achieves a 38 percent reduction in committed capacity when generation is scheduled based on a reliability criterion. These improvements provide practical value for power system operation, enabling risk-aware capacity scheduling under peak demand uncertainty and supporting reliability-driven decision making in future energy systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compl...</summary><p>Completed major revision</p></details> |

These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts, such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored. Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder, with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.</p></details> |  |

It has demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical TFT framework. The core idea of this work is inspired by the foundation studies, \textit{The Power of Quantum Neural Networks} by Amira Abbas \textit{et al.} and \textit{Quantum Vision Transformers} by El Amine Cherrat \textit{et al.}, published in \textit{ Nature Computational Science} (2021) and \textit{Quantum} (2024), respectively. A key advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit depth. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In particular, our experimental results on two different datasets display that the model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test loss. These results indicate the prospect of using quantum computing to boost deep learning architectures in complex machine learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

We study out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics, suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</p></details> |  |

However, practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g., automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g., text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images, audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems, aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment.

Forecasts help government agencies properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of suspected opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for different time intervals. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to minimize forecasting error. A variety of additional covariates relevant to opioid overdoses and public health were tested to determine their impact on model performance. Our evaluation shows that useful predictions can be generated with limited error for different types of regions, and high performance can be achieved using commonly available covariates and relatively simple forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

The framework encompasses existing architectures, such as input-dependent block-diagonal linear recurrent neural networks and DeltaNet's diagonal-plus-low-rank structure, as well as two novel variants based on sparsity and the Walsh-Hadamard transform. We prove that, unlike the diagonal state-transition matrices of S4D and Mamba, SLiCEs employing block-diagonal, sparse, or Walsh-Hadamard matrices match the maximal expressivity of dense matrices. Empirically, SLiCEs solve the $A_5$ state-tracking benchmark with a single layer, achieve best-in-class length generalisation on regular language tasks among parallel-in-time models, and match the performance of log neural controlled differential equations on six multivariate time-series classification datasets while cutting the average time per training step by a factor of twenty.</p></details> | 32 pages, 5 figures |

This results in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series generation methods across diverse datasets, assessing its strengths, limitations, and capacity to model complex temporal dependencies. Our results offer valuable insights into the SB framework's potential as a versatile and robust tool for time series generation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks and real data.</p></details> |  |

Although diagrams are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams, sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature, quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams.

We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to 13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs. Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and overall behavior in LLMs.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

However, in Named Entity Recognition (NER), existing ICL methods typically rely on task-agnostic semantic similarity for demonstration retrieval, which often yields less relevant examples and leads to inferior results. We introduce DEER, a training-free ICL approach that enables LLMs to make more informed entity predictions through the use of label-grounded statistics. DEER leverages token-level statistics from training labels to identify tokens most informative for entity recognition, enabling entity-focused demonstrations. It further uses these statistics to detect and refine error-prone tokens through a targeted reflection step. Evaluated on five NER datasets across four LLMs, DEER consistently outperforms existing ICL methods and achieves performance comparable to supervised fine-tuning. Further analyses demonstrate that DEER improves example retrieval, remains effective on both seen and unseen entities, and exhibits strong robustness in low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, their suitability for structured tabular data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP, and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits, baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, CIKM 2025 FinFAI workshop</p></details> |

However, the varied capabilities of these tools across model versions and the mixed availability of extensions that enable web search, code execution, or retrieval-augmented generation create opportunities for user misconceptions about what systems can and cannot do. Such misconceptions may lead to over-reliance, unproductive practices, or insufficient quality control in LLM-assisted programming. Here, we aim to characterize misconceptions that users of conversational LLM-based assistants may have in programming contexts. Using a two-phase approach, we first brainstorm and catalog user misconceptions that may occur, and then conduct a qualitative analysis to examine whether these conceptual issues surface in naturalistic Python-programming conversations with an LLM-based chatbot drawn from an openly available dataset. Indeed, we see evidence that some users have misplaced expectations about the availability of LLM-based chatbot features like web access, code execution, or non-text output generation. We also see potential evidence for deeper conceptual issues around the scope of information required to debug, validate, and optimize programs. Our findings reinforce the need for designing LLM-based tools that more clearly communicate their programming capabilities to users.</p></details> |  |

Using synthetic anti-money laundering (AML) scenarios that reflect common laundering behaviors, we show that LLMs can emulate analyst-style logic, highlight red flags, and provide coherent explanations. While this study is exploratory, it illustrates the potential of LLM-based graph reasoning in AML and lays groundwork for explainable, language-driven financial crime analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI4FCF-ICDM 2025</p></details> |

Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data (say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular) estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, this paper studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Multi-Agent System @ ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, current LLM-based approaches face critical limitations in modeling users' long-term and diverse interests. First, due to inference latency and feature fetching bandwidth constraints, existing methods typically truncate user behavior sequences to include only the most recent interactions, resulting in the loss of valuable long-range preference signals. Second, most current methods rely on next-item prediction with a single predicted embedding, overlooking the multifaceted nature of user interests and limiting recommendation diversity. To address these challenges, we propose HyMiRec, a hybrid multi-interest sequential recommendation framework, which leverages a lightweight recommender to extracts coarse interest embeddings from long user sequences and an LLM-based recommender to captures refined interest embeddings. To alleviate the overhead of fetching features, we introduce a residual codebook based on cosine similarity, enabling efficient compression and reuse of user history embeddings. To model the diverse preferences of users, we design a disentangled multi-interest learning module, which leverages multiple interest queries to learn disentangles multiple interest signals adaptively, allowing the model to capture different facets of user intent. Extensive experiments are conducted on both benchmark datasets and a collected industrial dataset, demonstrating our effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, online A/B testing shows that HyMiRec brings consistent improvements in real-world recommendation systems.

This subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia, USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.</p></details> |  |

Mainstream approaches follow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling item topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics based on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the modeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical confounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition. To bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the behavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and learn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show that it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient integration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems, for which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, TagCF exploits the (Multi-modal) LLM's world knowledge and logic inference ability to extract realistic tag-based virtual logic graphs that reveal dynamic and expressive knowledge of users, refining our understanding of user behaviors. On the other hand, TagCF presents empirically effective integration modules that take advantage of the extracted tag-logic information, augmenting the recommendation performance. We conduct both online experiments and offline experiments with industrial and public datasets as verification of TagCF's effectiveness, and we empirically show that the user role modeling strategy is potentially a better choice than the modeling of item topics. Additionally, we provide evidence that the extracted logic graphs are empirically a general and transferable knowledge that can benefit a wide range of recommendation tasks.

Experiments on European city queries show that Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona (public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall.

As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to understand how LLMs function when collaborating compared to operating as individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a Utilitarian Boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that inflict harm but maximize benefits for the greatest number of people. We study whether a similar dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We test six models on well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where models reason independently, and (2) Group, where they engage in multi-turn discussions in pairs or triads. In personal dilemmas, where agents decide whether to directly harm an individual for the benefit of others, all models rated moral violations as more acceptable when part of a group, demonstrating a Utilitarian Boost similar to that observed in humans. However, the mechanism for the Boost in LLMs differed: While humans in groups become more utilitarian due to heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups showed either reduced sensitivity to norms or enhanced impartiality. We report model differences in when and how strongly the Boost manifests. We also discuss prompt and agent compositions that enhance or mitigate the effect. We end with a discussion of the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent design, and artificial moral reasoning.

The increasing interest in LLMs in academia is also reflected in the number of publications on this topic over the last years. For instance, alone 78 of the around 425 publications at ICSE 2024 performed experiments with LLMs. Conducting empirical studies with LLMs remains challenging and raises questions on how to achieve reproducible results, for both other researchers and practitioners. One important step towards excelling in empirical research on LLMs and their application is to first understand to what extent current research results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede reproducibility. This investigation is within the scope of our work. We contribute an analysis of the reproducibility of LLM-centric studies, provide insights into the factors impeding reproducibility, and discuss suggestions on how to improve the current state. In particular, we studied the 86 articles describing LLM-centric studies, published at ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. Of the 86 articles, 18 provided research artefacts and used OpenAI models. We attempted to replicate those 18 studies. Of the 18 studies, only five were fit for reproduction. For none of the five studies, we were able to fully reproduce the results. Two studies seemed to be partially reproducible, and three studies did not seem to be reproducible. Our results highlight not only the need for stricter research artefact evaluations but also for more robust study designs to ensure the reproducible value of future publications.</p></details> |  |

This study presents the first large-scale, multilingual analysis of persona-targeted disinformation generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we prompt eight state-of-the-art LLMs with 324 false narratives and 150 demographic personas (combinations of country, generation, and political orientation) across four languages--English, Russian, Portuguese, and Hindi--resulting in AI-TRAITS, a comprehensive dataset of 1.6 million personalised disinformation texts. Results show that the use of even simple personalisation prompts significantly increases the likelihood of jailbreaks across all studied LLMs, up to 10 percentage points, and alters linguistic and rhetorical patterns that enhance narrative persuasiveness. Models such as Grok and GPT exhibited jailbreak rates and personalisation scores both exceeding 85%. These insights expose critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.</p></details> |  |

While this enhances user experience, recent research reveals that it exposes a non-trivial attack surface through network side-channels. Adversaries can exploit patterns in encrypted traffic to infer sensitive information and reconstruct private conversations. In response, LLM providers and third-party services are deploying defenses such as traffic padding and obfuscation to mitigate these vulnerabilities. This paper starts by presenting a systematic analysis of contemporary side-channel defenses in mainstream LLM applications, with a focus on services from vendors like OpenAI and DeepSeek. We identify and examine seven representative deployment scenarios, each incorporating active/passive mitigation techniques. Despite these enhanced security measures, our investigation uncovers significant residual information that remains vulnerable to leakage within the network traffic. Building on this discovery, we introduce NetEcho, a novel, LLM-based framework that comprehensively unleashes the network side-channel risks of today's LLM applications. NetEcho is designed to recover entire conversations -- including both user prompts and LLM responses -- directly from encrypted network traffic. It features a deliberate design that ensures high-fidelity text recovery, transferability across different deployment scenarios, and moderate operational cost. In our evaluations on medical and legal applications built upon leading models like DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, NetEcho can recover avg $\sim$70\% information of each conversation, demonstrating a critical limitation in current defense mechanisms. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and proposing future directions for augmenting network traffic security.</p></details> |  |

Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented LLM applications.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce a framework that situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy, thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving transparency and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, Vancouver, BC, September 11--14 2025</p></details> |

We argue that advancing HCI requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore, implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models. Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction more natural and contextually grounded.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is approximately 7360 words and contains 12 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |

LLM-based Conversational Agents to Mitigate Passive Fatigue in Conditional Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25421v1)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.25421v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Passive fatigue during conditional automated driving can compromise driver readiness and safety. This paper presents findings from a test-track study with 40 participants in a real-world rural automated driving scenario. In this scenario, a Large Language Model (LLM) based conversational agent (CA) was designed to check in with drivers and re-engage them with their surroundings. Drawing on in-car video recordings, sleepiness ratings and interviews, we analysed how drivers interacted with the agent and how these interactions shaped alertness. Users found the CA helpful for supporting vigilance during passive fatigue. Thematic analysis of acceptability further revealed three user preference profiles that implicate future intention to use CAs. Positioning empirically observed profiles within existing CA archetype frameworks highlights the need for adaptive design sensitive to diverse user groups. This work underscores the potential of CAs as proactive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) interventions, demonstrating how natural language can support context-aware interaction during automated driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CHI '26 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</p></details> |

Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO) can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional expert-based methods struggle to keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology. In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological convergence. Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend analysis of topic co-occurence. We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text analysis.</p></details> |  |

Recent scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models (LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the conclusions produced by generative AI.</p></details> |  |

Traditional testing approaches using Example-based Testing (EBT) often miss edge cases -- defects that occur at boundary values, special input patterns, or extreme conditions. This research investigates the characteristics of LLM-generated Property-based Testing (PBT) compared to EBT for exploring edge cases. We analyze 16 HumanEval problems where standard solutions failed on extended test cases, generating both PBT and EBT test codes using Claude-4-sonnet. Our experimental results reveal that while each method individually achieved a 68.75\% bug detection rate, combining both approaches improved detection to 81.25\%. The analysis demonstrates complementary characteristics: PBT effectively detects performance issues and edge cases through extensive input space exploration, while EBT effectively detects specific boundary conditions and special patterns. These findings suggest that a hybrid approach leveraging both testing methods can improve the reliability of LLM-generated code, providing guidance for test generation strategies in LLM-based code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2nd IEEE/ACM international conference on AI-powered Software (AIware 2025) : 8 pages, 1 table, 8 figures</p></details> |

A Comparative Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05493v2)** | 2025-10-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.05493v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, integrating large language models (LLMs) into recommender systems has created new opportunities for improving recommendation quality. However, a comprehensive benchmark is needed to thoroughly evaluate and compare the recommendation capabilities of LLMs with traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we introduce RecBench, which systematically investigates various item representation forms (including unique identifier, text, semantic embedding, and semantic identifier) and evaluates two primary recommendation tasks, i.e., click-through rate prediction (CTR) and sequential recommendation (SeqRec). Our extensive experiments cover up to 17 large models and are conducted across five diverse datasets from fashion, news, video, books, and music domains. Our findings indicate that LLM-based recommenders outperform conventional recommenders, achieving up to a 5% AUC improvement in the CTR scenario and up to a 170% NDCG@10 improvement in the SeqRec scenario. However, these substantial performance gains come at the expense of significantly reduced inference efficiency, rendering the LLM-as-RS paradigm impractical for real-time recommendation environments. We aim for our findings to inspire future research, including recommendation-specific model acceleration methods. We will release our code, data, configurations, and platform to enable other researchers to reproduce and build upon our experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 DB Track Accepted Paper</p></details> |

Existing evaluation methods for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this, we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets, multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content.

In addition, WEST provides two types of recipes, models, and experimental results. The first is entirely based on open-source models and open-source data, allowing users to fully reproduce the experiments in this paper and serving as a verification system or minimal system baseline. The second is trained on massive data, offering superior performance so the user can directly apply it out of the box.

This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Conceptually, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of numerous experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves structural flexibility of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation.

Does their impressive performance reflect genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages. Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa (low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide, significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking" that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, our study moves beyond effectiveness alone. We aim to explore how labeling decisions -- by both humans and LLMs -- can be statistically evaluated across individuals. Rather than treating LLMs purely as annotation systems, we approach LLMs as an alternative annotation mechanism that may be capable of mimicking the subjective judgments made by humans. To assess this, we develop a statistical evaluation method based on Krippendorff's $\alpha$, paired bootstrapping, and the Two One-Sided t-Tests (TOST) equivalence test procedure. This evaluation method tests whether an LLM can blend into a group of human annotators without being distinguishable. We apply this approach to two datasets -- MovieLens 100K and PolitiFact -- and find that the LLM is statistically indistinguishable from a human annotator in the former ($p = 0.004$), but not in the latter ($p = 0.155$), highlighting task-dependent differences. It also enables early evaluation on a small sample of human data to inform whether LLMs are suitable for large-scale annotation in a given application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR-AP 2025</p></details> |

Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures.

While promising, existing methods suffer from two major limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion, preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework. Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth (IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT), further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target LLM's capabilities.

While role-playing large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107 controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics. We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically simulating human-like social dynamics.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in proof generation, they frequently produce incorrect proofs on the first attempt and require additional strategies for iterative refinement. However, existing approaches employ fixed refinement strategies and cannot dynamically choose an effective strategy based on the particular issues in a generated proof, which limits their performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Adapt, a novel proof refinement framework that leverages an LLM-guided decision-maker to dynamically select a suitable refinement strategy according to the state of the proof assistant and available context of an incorrect proof. We evaluate Adapt on two benchmarks against four existing methods and find that it significantly outperforms the best baseline on both by proving 16.63% and 18.58% more theorems, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate Adapt's generalizability by evaluating it across five different LLMs. We also conduct ablation studies to measure the contribution of each component and compare the trade-offs of alternative decision-maker designs.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |

Existing LoRA-based continual methods primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors. Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware, direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.</p></details> |  |

However, these models remain fragile or entirely incapable when extended to multi-modal tasks. Existing approaches largely rely on single-form captions, which lack diversity and often fail to adapt across different types of Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel for transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a modular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through an agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception agent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively distill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs) tailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM, which serves as a reasoning agent. Crucially, the translator and reasoner engage in multi-round feedback and interaction, enabling the extraction of targeted visual details and yielding more confident answers. Experiments on knowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, including MMMU and MIA-Bench, demonstrate that Seeing Eye not only reduces inference cost but also surpasses much larger end-to-end VLMs. For example, an instantiation combining a 3B-parameter vision translator with an 8B-parameter language reasoner outperforms a monolithic 32B VLM on challenging knowledge-based questions. Our results highlight that decoupling perception from reasoning via agent information flow offers a scalable and plug-and-play pathway to multimodal reasoning, allowing strong text-only LLMs to fully leverage their reasoning capabilities.

Existing approaches often fail to unify structural, semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware specialization under sparse activation.

In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs) for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity. Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF). DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the persona profile to mitigate these divergences. We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews. DPRF can consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas and generalizes across models and scenarios. Our work provides a robust methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies, and personalized AI.</p></details> | In Submission |

Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own reasoning process.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas. ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query 100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments, scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage persona-invariant prompting strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For associated code repository, see http://github.com/banyasp/consistencyAI For user-friendly web app, see http://v0-llm-comparison-webapp.vercel.app/</p></details> |

A total of 12 open-source LLMs, ranging from 124 million to 70 billion parameters, are served using the vLLM framework. Our analysis reveals that QAic achieves competitive energy efficiency with advantages on specific models while enabling more granular hardware allocation: some 70B models operate on as few as 1 QAic card versus 8 A100 GPUs required, with 20x lower power consumption (148W vs 2,983W). For smaller models, single QAic devices achieve up to 35x lower power consumption compared to our 4-GPU A100 configuration (36W vs 1,246W).

Heuristic and ML tuners are often system specific, require manual glue, and degrade under changes. Recent LLM-based approaches help but usually treat tuning as a single-shot, system-specific task, which limits cross-system reuse, constrains exploration, and weakens validation. We present StorageXTuner, an LLM agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines. StorageXTuner separates concerns across four agents - Executor (sandboxed benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management). The design couples an insight-driven tree search with layered memory that promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to guard against unsafe actions. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C. Relative to out-of-the-box settings and to ELMo-Tune, StorageXTuner reaches up to 575% and 111% higher throughput, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and 56%, and converges with fewer trials.</p></details> | <details><summary>ArXiv...</summary><p>ArXiv version; Affiliations: Arizona State University (Lin, Zhang, Thakkar, Sun, Cao) and Iowa State University (Zheng)</p></details> |

While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments.

Although numerous automated GUI testing approaches have been developed with diverse strategies, a substantial gap remains between these approaches and the underlying app business logic. Most existing approaches focus on general exploration rather than the completion of specific testing scenarios, often missing critical functionalities. Inspired by manual testing, which treats business logic-driven scenarios as the fundamental unit of testing, this paper introduces an approach that leverages large language models to comprehend GUI semantics and contextual relevance to given scenarios. Building on this capability, we propose ScenGen, an LLM-guided scenario-based GUI testing framework employing multi-agent collaboration to simulate and automate manual testing phases. Specifically, ScenGen integrates five agents: the Observer, Decider, Executor, Supervisor, and Recorder. The Observer perceives the app GUI state by extracting and structuring GUI widgets and layouts, interpreting semantic information. This is passed to the Decider, which makes scenario-driven decisions with LLM guidance to identify target widgets and determine actions toward fulfilling specific goals. The Executor performs these operations, while the Supervisor verifies alignment with intended scenario completion, ensuring traceability and consistency. Finally, the Recorder logs GUI operations into context memory as a knowledge base for subsequent decision-making and monitors runtime bugs. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ScenGen effectively generates scenario-based GUI tests guided by LLM collaboration, achieving higher relevance to business logic and improving the completeness of automated GUI testing.</p></details> |  |

While humans intuitively perform this translation based on common sense and embodied understanding, whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II, and Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against annotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples substantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted enhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities.

This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy. However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score (r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to 3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.</p></details> |  |

To operationalize this, we present the AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary agents.

A common practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP), instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students, residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct, role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style. We test this framework on three medical QA datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the cognitive complexity found in real-world medical practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the related code in the following repository:https: //github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/RolePlay_LLMDoctor</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Long-Context Modeling with Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention for On-Device LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24606v1)** | 2025-10-28 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.24606v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic cost of attention hinders the scalability of long-context LLMs, especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing static sparse methods such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention (DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Efficient Reasoning</p></details> |

However, current dLLMs suffer from fixed generation lengths, which indicates the generation lengths of dLLMs have to be determined before decoding as a hyper-parameter, leading to issues in efficiency and flexibility. To solve these problems, in this work, we propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths, abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama. Our method achieves higher accuracy and faster inference, elevating dLLMs beyond mere academic novelty and supporting their practical use in real-world applications. Codes and models have been released.</p></details> |  |

How might the outputs differ? Or, to prepare ourselves for the worse, how might they converge? Scholars have raised concerns LLM based applications can homogenize cultures and flatten perspectives. But exactly how much does LLM generated outputs converge despite explicit different role assignment? This study provides empirical evidence to the above question. The critique centres on pretrained models regurgitating ossified political jargons used in the Western world when speaking about China, Iran, Russian, and US politics, despite changes in these countries happening daily or hourly. The experiments combine role-prompting and similarity metrics. The results show that AI generated discourses from four models about Iran and China are the most homogeneous and unchanging across all four models, including OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek, despite the prompted perspective change and the actual changes in real life. This study does not engage with history, politics, or literature as traditional disciplinary approaches would; instead, it takes cues from international and area studies and offers insight on the future trajectory of shifting political discourse in a digital space increasingly cannibalised by AI.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods that mimic reference confidence expressions often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment. We propose natural language critiques as a solution, ideally suited for confidence calibration, as precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain and often require multiple generations. This paper studies how natural language critiques can enhance verbalized confidence, addressing: (1) What to critique: uncertainty (question-focused) or confidence (answer-specific)? Analysis shows confidence suits multiple-choice tasks, while uncertainty excels in open-ended scenarios. (2) How to critique: self-critique or critique calibration training? We propose Self-Critique, enabling LLMs to critique and optimize their confidence beyond mere accuracy, and CritiCal, a novel Critique Calibration training method that leverages natural language critiques to improve confidence calibration, moving beyond direct numerical optimization. Experiments show that CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive baselines, even surpassing its teacher model, GPT-4o, in complex reasoning tasks. CritiCal also shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution settings, advancing LLM's reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, their scalability to multi-turn LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on challenging agent benchmarks, including ALFWorld and WebShop, as well as tool-integrated reasoning on search-augmented QA tasks, using Qwen2.5-1.5B/3B/7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals, achieves performance gains of > 12% on ALFWorld and > 9% on WebShop over GRPO, and obtains superior performance on QA tasks (42.1% on 3B and 47.2% on 7B): all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Detecting and evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible language technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, their synergistic potential and underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations.

Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp, Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5 refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and model-agnostic.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico, an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.</p></details> |  |

We propose a scalable framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate geo-temporal embeddings from only a timestamp and coarse location, capturing holidays, seasonal trends, and local/global events. We then introduce a geo-temporal embedding informativeness test as a lightweight diagnostic, demonstrating on MovieLens, LastFM, and a production dataset that these embeddings provide predictive signal consistent with the outcomes of full model integrations. Geo-temporal embeddings are incorporated into sequential models through (1) direct feature fusion with metadata embeddings or (2) an auxiliary loss that enforces semantic and geo-temporal alignment. Our findings highlight the need for adaptive or hybrid recommendation strategies, and we release a context-enriched MovieLens dataset to support future research.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the complexity of the protocol and the uncertainty of cross-layer interaction, there are often inconsistencies between the implementation of the protocol stack code and the RFC standard. This inconsistency may not only lead to differences in protocol functions but also cause serious security vulnerabilities. At present, with the continuous expansion of protocol stack functions and the rapid iteration of RFC documents, it is increasingly important to detect and fix these inconsistencies. With the rise of large language models, researchers have begun to explore how to extract protocol specifications from RFC documents through these models, including protocol stack modeling, state machine extraction, text ambiguity analysis, and other related content. However, existing methods rely on predefined patterns or rule-based approaches that fail to generalize across different protocol specifications. Automated and scalable detection of these inconsistencies remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an automated analysis framework based on LLM and differential models. By modeling the iterative relationship of the protocol and based on the iterative update relationship of the RFC standard, we perform incremental code function analysis on different versions of kernel code implementations to automatically perform code detection and vulnerability analysis. We conduct extensive evaluations to validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying potential vulnerabilities caused by RFC code inconsistencies.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

However, current pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g., common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench, a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations after post-training.</p></details> | 46 pages |

Current LLM reasoning, hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services. Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1) \textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie, efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75% through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.</p></details> |  |

This surge has exposed a critical bottleneck: the lack of scalable, reliable methods to evaluate these outputs. Human evaluation is costly and time-consuming, while traditional automated metrics like BLEU fail to capture nuanced quality aspects. In response, the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm - using LLMs for automated evaluation - has emerged. This approach leverages the advanced reasoning of LLMs, offering a path toward human-like nuance at automated scale. However, LLM-as-a-Judge research in SE is still in its early stages. This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLM-generated software artifacts. We provide a literature review of existing SE studies, analyze their limitations, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap. We envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates capable of consistent, multi-faceted artifact evaluation by 2030. Our work aims to foster research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, ultimately improving the scalability of software artifact evaluation.</p></details> |  |

It achieves fault detection and correction at runtime by adding diverse redundancy into programs, minimizing fault mode overlap between redundant program variants. In this work, we propose the automated generation of program variants using large language models. We design, develop and evaluate Gal\'apagos: a tool for generating program variants using LLMs, validating their correctness and equivalence, and using them to assemble N-Version binaries. We evaluate Gal\'apagos by creating N-Version components of real-world C code. Our original results show that Gal\'apagos can produce program variants that are proven to be functionally equivalent, even when the variants are written in a different programming language. Our systematic diversity measurement indicates that functionally equivalent variants produced by Gal\'apagos, are statically different after compilation, and present diverging internal behavior at runtime. We demonstrate that the variants produced by Gal\'apagos can protect C code against real miscompilation bugs which affect the Clang compiler. Overall, our paper shows that producing N-Version software can be drastically automated by advanced usage of practical formal verification and generative language models.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose an agent-driven benchmark construction pipeline that leverages human supervision to efficiently generate diverse and challenging project-level tasks. Based on this approach, we introduce PRDBench, a novel benchmark comprising 50 real-world Python projects across 20 domains, each with structured Product Requirement Document (PRD) requirements, comprehensive evaluation criteria, and reference implementations. PRDBench features rich data sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of various test types beyond unit tests.

This task can be seen as a form of claim verification, where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims, represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs; (2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM) from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents, extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of evidence for claim verification.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can translate human natural language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge during hierarchical reinforcement learning. We apply a structured evaluation framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT, Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition granularity and task complexity. The results expose limitations in current LLMs capacity for representation alignment, highlighting the need for further research on robust alignment between language and internal agent representations.</p></details> |  |

Social graphs provide high-quality supervision signals that encode both local interactions and global network structure, yet they remain underutilized for LLM training. To address this gap, we propose Graphia, the first general LLM-based social graph simulation framework that leverages graph data as supervision for LLM post-training via reinforcement learning. With GNN-based structural rewards, Graphia trains specialized agents to predict whom to interact with (destination selection) and how to interact (edge generation), followed by designed graph generation pipelines. We evaluate Graphia under two settings: Transductive Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG), a micro-level task with our proposed node-wise interaction alignment metrics; and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG), a macro-level task with our proposed metrics for aligning emergent network properties. On three real-world networks, Graphia improves micro-level alignment by 6.1% in the composite destination selection score, 12% in edge classification accuracy, and 27.9% in edge content BERTScore over the strongest baseline. For macro-level alignment, it achieves 41.11% higher structural similarity and 32.98% better replication of social phenomena such as power laws and echo chambers. Graphia also supports counterfactual simulation, generating plausible behavioral shifts under platform incentives. Our results show that social graphs can serve as high-quality supervision signals for LLM post-training, closing the gap between agent behaviors and network dynamics for LLM-based simulation.

Although adversarial training has been widely studied and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous relaxations. At the same time, despite their effectiveness and generalization capabilities, training with continuous perturbations does not always capture the full spectrum of vulnerabilities exploited by discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT, a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate (ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation, revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies.

Using the Bolt platform and standardized prompts from Baxbench, we generated four service-oriented applications and subjected them to 50-hour load tests. Resource usage, response time, and throughput were continuously monitored to detect degradation patterns. The results reveal significant evidence of software aging, including progressive memory growth, increased response time, and performance instability across all applications.

While Critical AI Studies provides essential material and socio-technical critique, it risks overlooking how LLMs phenomenologically reshape meaning-making. This paper proposes a semiotics of "surface integrity" as attending to the immediate plane where LLMs inscribe themselves into human communication. I distinguish three knowledge interests in ML research (epistemology, epist\=em\=e, and epistemics) and argue for integrating surface-level stylistic analysis alongside depth-oriented critique. Through two case studies examining stylistic markers of synthetic text, I argue how attending to style as a semiotic phenomenon reveals LLMs as cultural actors that transform the conditions of meaning emergence and circulation in contemporary discourse, independent of questions about machine consciousness.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |

HAI aims to better serve human welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a vision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task performance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent achieves a 28\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real environments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly improving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction tasks.</p></details> |  |

Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances. We have evaluated 17 LLMs on HalloMTBench. Results reveal distinct ``hallucination triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified language mixing. HalloMTBench offers a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing LLM translation failures. HalloMTBench is available in https://huggingface.co/collections/AIDC-AI/marco-mt.</p></details> |  |

Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs, PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy visual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context length cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant frames hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial. This paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles: query relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such as uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these principles. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with dynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and model-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the query using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert space~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the similarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To incorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each segment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov decision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments. Theoretically, MDP3 provides a \((1 - 1/e)\)-approximate solution to the NP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time complexity, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, MDP3 significantly outperforms existing methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | 26 pages, 14 figures |

Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose TrajAgent, an agent framework powered by large language models, designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In TrajAgent, we first develop UniEnv, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on UniEnv, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on five tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajAgent in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38%-69.91% over baseline methods.

This enables applications to implement new KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and seamlessly integrate computation and I/O-entirely within the application, without requiring modifications to the serving system. Pie executes inferlets using WebAssembly, benefiting from its lightweight sandboxing. Our evaluation shows Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x higher) on agentic workflows by enabling application-specific optimizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>SOSP ...</summary><p>SOSP 2025.

Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism inspired by experience replay in traditional RL. This technique reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates. Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 23% to 62% while reaching the same level of performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs (e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.</p></details> | 29 pages, 4 figures |

However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic, token-level gating mechanism inspired by the "propose-and-verify" paradigm of speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively applied only to "accepted" tokens, while "rejected" tokens are masked out. Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically fine-tune LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope. However, these methods often rely on coarse-grained signals to guide LLMs to abstain, such as overall confidence or uncertainty scores on multiple sampled answers, which may result in an imprecise awareness of the model's own knowledge boundaries. To this end, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on $\textbf{\underline{Fi}ne-grained \underline{S}emantic \underline{Co}nfidence \underline{Re}ward (\Ours)}$, which guides LLMs to abstain via sample-specific confidence. Specifically, our method operates by sampling multiple candidate answers and conducting semantic clustering, then training the LLM to retain answers within high-confidence clusters and discard those within low-confidence ones, thereby promoting accurate post-hoc abstention. Additionally, we propose a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention fine-tuning tasks more comprehensively. Our method significantly enhances reliability in both in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks.</p></details> | 23pages, 4figures |

We introduce a lifecycle-aware framework that systematically incorporates intermediate artifacts such as requirements analysis, state machine modeling, and pseudocode into both the training and inference stages. This design aligns code generation with standard software development phases and enables more structured reasoning. Experiments show that lifecycle-level fine-tuning improves code correctness by up to 75% over the same model before fine-tuning, with performance gains compounding across intermediate stages. Multi-step inference consistently surpasses single-step generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of intermediate scaffolding. Notably, open-source LLMs, once fine-tuned under our framework, match or slightly outperform models pretrained on code. When applied to DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B, our framework yields relative CodeBLEU improvements of 34.3%, 20.0%, 11.2%, and 22.3% over ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and LLaMA-8B, respectively. Our pipeline also proves robust with up to 80\% less training data, confirming its resilience.

In particular, LLMs are increasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating predictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised learning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a critical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data representation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task can drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply changing variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82% in certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to task-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we discover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable names/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive more attention when output tokens are generated, even though different positions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially explains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also consider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained specifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve prediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant variations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities, currently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a principled data-fitting tool.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT) problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than 100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited resources when effectively configured.</p></details> |  |

Traditional agent-based or deep learning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to capture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large language models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative reasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level narrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral execution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent is employed as a "creative writer" to produce diary-style narratives rich in motivation and context, then uses another agent as a "structural parser" to convert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module further grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive behavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility Entropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility across different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent executes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time intervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding this multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic trajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable representations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic mobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven simulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and synthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents.</p></details> | 47 pages, 3 figures |

In this paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration using zero-shot image-based diffusion models without retraining or modifying their architecture. We propose two complementary inference-time strategies: (1) Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) based on the neuroscience-inspired perceptual straightening hypothesis, which steers the diffusion denoising process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores, such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and perceptual straightness; and (2) Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which aims at reducing stochastic variation by ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity (distortion) scores, such as PSNR and SSIM, without sacrificing sharpness. Together, these training-free techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion models. We performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and degradation types, systematically evaluating each strategy to understand their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while PSG enhances temporal naturalness, particularly in case of temporal blur, MPES consistently improves fidelity and spatio-temporal perception--distortion trade-off across all tasks.</p></details> |  |

While deep optics with elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this, we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture. Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging.

Existing approaches typically rely on Degradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide image restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation information and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome these limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration framework that introduces a fine-grained degradation extractor and a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM). The DP-SSM leverages the fine-grained degradation features captured by the extractor as dynamic prompts, which are then incorporated into the state space modeling process. This enhances the model's adaptability to diverse degradation types, while a complementary High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB) recovers local high-frequency details. Extensive experiments on a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR achieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM, respectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of DPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.</p></details> |  |

However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile, we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively. Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chine...</summary><p>Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision (PRCV), Oral</p></details> |

However, the functional mismatch between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO (LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall accuracy.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Residual Diffusion Bridge Model for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23116v1)** | 2025-10-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.23116v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides, they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks.

| **[Reducing the Representation Error of GAN Image Priors Using the Deep Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08747v2)** | 2025-10-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2001.08747v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, such as GANs, learn an explicit low-dimensional representation of a particular class of images, and so they may be used as natural image priors for solving inverse problems such as image restoration and compressive sensing. GAN priors have demonstrated impressive performance on these tasks, but they can exhibit substantial representation error for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution images, because of the mismatch between the learned, approximate image distribution and the data generating distribution. In this paper, we demonstrate a method for reducing the representation error of GAN priors by modeling images as the linear combination of a GAN prior with a Deep Decoder. The deep decoder is an underparameterized and most importantly unlearned natural signal model similar to the Deep Image Prior. No knowledge of the specific inverse problem is needed in the training of the GAN underlying our method. For compressive sensing and image superresolution, our hybrid model exhibits consistently higher PSNRs than both the GAN priors and Deep Decoder separately, both on in-distribution and out-of-distribution images. This model provides a method for extensibly and cheaply leveraging both the benefits of learned and unlearned image recovery priors in inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach for image generation, performs scale-space autoregression and achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. Moreover, our analysis reveals that coarse scales in VAR primarily capture degradations while finer scales encode scene detail, simplifying the restoration process. Motivated by this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel VAR-based generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $10\times$ faster inference. To optimally exploit the advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/restorevarpage/</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples, computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared, higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

The main technical challenge facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First, we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing LUT-realizable CNN methods.</p></details> |  |

While Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We propose a deep learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Accurately estimating the underlying degradation can intuitively provide restoration models with more targeted and effective guidance, enabling adaptive processing strategies. To this end, we propose a Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism (MODEM) for adverse weather image restoration. Central to MODEM is the Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module (MOS2D), which integrates Morton-coded spatial ordering with selective state-space models to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local structural coherence. Complementing MOS2D, we introduce a Dual Degradation Estimation Module (DDEM) that disentangles and estimates both global and local degradation priors. These priors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and context-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex degradation dynamics.

We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://w2genai-lab.github.io/LucidFlux</p></details> |

However, deep learning typically requires large training datasets, which are rarely available in astrophotography. Deep Image Prior (DIP) bypasses this constraint by performing blind training on a single image. Although effective in some cases, DIP often suffers from overfitting, artifact generation, and instability. To overcome these issues and improve general performance, this work proposes DIPLI - a framework that shifts from single-frame to multi-frame training using the Back Projection technique, combined with optical flow estimation via the TVNet model, and replaces deterministic predictions with unbiased Monte Carlo estimation obtained through Langevin dynamics. A comprehensive evaluation compares the method against Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique still widely used in astronomical image reconstruction, DIP, the transformer-based model RVRT, and the diffusion-based model DiffIR2VR-Zero. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate consistent improvements, with the method outperforming baselines for SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and DISTS metrics in the majority of cases. In addition to superior reconstruction quality, the model also requires far fewer input images than Lucky Imaging and is less prone to overfitting or artifact generation. Evaluation on real-world astronomical data, where domain shifts typically hinder generalization, shows that the method maintains high reconstruction quality, confirming practical robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant of the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called scSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above-mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI , a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing ratio) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of scSplit on 5 public datasets.

We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and recognition in practical deployment scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Nonetheless, the theory available for the Gaussian case cannot be extended to the Poisson case, due to the non-Lipschitz gradient of the fidelity function, the Kullback-Leibler functional, or the absence of closed-form solution for the proximal operator of such term, leading to employ iterative solvers for the inner subproblem. In this work we extend the idea of PIDSplit+ algorithm, exploiting the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, to PnP scheme: this allows to provide a closed form solution for the deblurring step, with no need for iterative solvers. The convergence of the method is assured by employing a firmly non expansive denoiser. The proposed method, namely PnPSplit+, is tested on different Poisson image restoration problems, showing remarkable performance even in presence of high noise level and severe blurring conditions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods depend on costly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image noise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose a cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and visual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These cameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter occlusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that reconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For pose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates the system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between simulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the alignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing image alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical model, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach, with Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171 mm, and 0.858 mm, respectively.

Built upon the Noise2Noise training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for practical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters, making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining, dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at https://github.com/Thomkat/MIR-L.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WI-IAT 2025</p></details> |
| **[Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Masked Degradation Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13282v1)** | 2025-10-15 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.13282v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method (MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19 degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.</p></details> |  |

Although Deblurring and Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) are related under these conditions, most approaches in image restoration solve these tasks separately. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods. Our model, DarkIR, achieves new state-of-the-art results on the popular LOLBlur, LOLv2 and Real-LOLBlur datasets, being able to generalize on real-world night and dark images.

However, in practice, the goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on inverse scattering benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Meta-lenses, composed of planar arrays of nanoscale scatterers, promise dramatic reductions in size and weight compared to conventional refractive optics. However, severe chromatic aberration, pronounced light scattering, narrow spectral bandwidth, and low light efficiency continue to limit their practical adoption. In this work, we present an end-to-end solution for in-the-wild imaging that pairs a metalens several times thinner than conventional optics with a bespoke multi-image restoration framework optimized for practical metalens cameras. Our method centers on a lightweight convolutional network paired with a memory-efficient burst fusion algorithm that adaptively corrects noise, saturation clipping, and lens-induced distortions across rapid sequences of extremely degraded metalens captures. Extensive experiments on diverse, real-world handheld captures demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing burst-mode and single-image restoration techniques.These results point toward a practical route for deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday imaging applications.</p></details> |  |

While recent defenses in image classification have successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient, as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks: super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from unauthorized knowledge distillation.</p></details> |  |

When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts (PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals, enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives. Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and efficiency.

The competition is built upon a newly established evaluation benchmark featuring challenging low-light noisy images captured in the wild using five different DSLR cameras. Participants are tasked with developing novel noise synthesis pipelines, network architectures, and training methodologies to achieve high performance across different camera models. Winners are determined based on a combination of performance metrics, including full-reference measures (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), and non-reference ones (ARNIQA, TOPIQ). By pushing the boundaries of camera-agnostic low-light RAW image denoising trained on synthetic data, the competition promotes the development of robust and practical models aligned with the rapid progress in digital photography. We expect the competition outcomes to influence multiple domains, from image restoration to night-time autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Available datasets for thermal imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge, this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration pipeline.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.

Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However, challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications.

In particular, state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures |

Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality (HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate, less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement, and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models, the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM), which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space. We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of image restoration and generation.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{InverseBench}, a framework that evaluates diffusion models across five distinct scientific inverse problems. These problems present unique structural challenges that differ from existing benchmarks, arising from critical scientific applications such as optical tomography, medical imaging, black hole imaging, seismology, and fluid dynamics. With \textsc{InverseBench}, we benchmark 14 inverse problem algorithms that use plug-and-play diffusion priors against strong, domain-specific baselines, offering valuable new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms.

A common approach is to formulate the problem in a Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable, estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone. SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |

First, QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current LoRA-adapted and cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while effectively controlling memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning. A Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These learned trajectories replace rigid patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The integration of QCLAM and GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while maintaining high computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose 'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection. RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods often rely on task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle, guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core, WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module} (LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation, enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)} module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to complex weather degradations.</p></details> |  |

Existing all-in-one restoration (AIR) approaches either depend on external text prompts or embed hand-crafted architectural priors (e.g., frequency heuristics); both impose discrete, brittle assumptions that weaken generalization to unseen or mixed degradations. To address this limitation, we propose to reframe AIR as learned latent prior inference, where degradation-aware representations are automatically inferred from the input without explicit task cues. Based on latent priors, we formulate AIR as a structured reasoning paradigm: (1) which features to route (adaptive feature selection), (2) where to restore (spatial localization), and (3) what to restore (degradation semantics). We design a lightweight decoding module that efficiently leverages these latent encoded cues for spatially-adaptive restoration. Extensive experiments across six common degradation tasks, five compound settings, and previously unseen degradations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, achieving an average PSNR improvement of 1.68 dB while being three times more efficient.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent stochastic differential equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its simplicity, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various image restoration tasks.

Our goal is to reconstruct high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR) domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical image enhancement.</p></details> |  |

This is partly due to the lack of controlled, ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges, such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes, using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance. Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks, including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of our system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures, submitted to IEEE Journal of Ocean Engineering</p></details> |

We propose \textbf{R-Splatting}, a unified framework that bridges underwater image restoration (UIR) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve both rendering quality and geometric fidelity. Our method integrates multiple enhanced views produced by diverse UIR models into a single reconstruction pipeline. During inference, a lightweight illumination generator samples latent codes to support diverse yet coherent renderings, while a contrastive loss ensures disentangled and stable illumination representations. Furthermore, we propose \textit{Uncertainty-Aware Opacity Optimization (UAOO)}, which models opacity as a stochastic function to regularize training. This suppresses abrupt gradient responses triggered by illumination variation and mitigates overfitting to noisy or view-specific artifacts. Experiments on Seathru-NeRF and our new BlueCoral3D dataset demonstrate that R-Splatting outperforms strong baselines in both rendering quality and geometric accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods for image restoration either rely on data-driven priors that are susceptible to hallucinations, or are limited to static low-density smoke. We introduce SmokeSeer, a method for simultaneous 3D scene reconstruction and smoke removal from a video capturing multiple views of a scene. Our method uses thermal and RGB images, leveraging the fact that the reduced scattering in thermal images enables us to see through the smoke. We build upon 3D Gaussian splatting to fuse information from the two image modalities, and decompose the scene explicitly into smoke and non-smoke components. Unlike prior approaches, SmokeSeer handles a broad range of smoke densities and can adapt to temporally varying smoke. We validate our approach on synthetic data and introduce a real-world multi-view smoke dataset with RGB and thermal images.

Traditional task-specific methods often fail to generalize to unseen or complex degradation types, while recent prompt-learning approaches depend heavily on the degradation estimation capabilities of vision-language models, resulting in inconsistent restorations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LCDiff}, a novel framework comprising two key components: \textit{Lumina-Chroma Decomposition Network} (LCDN) and \textit{Lumina-Guided Diffusion Model} (LGDM). LCDN processes degraded images in the YCbCr color space, separately handling degradation-related luminance and degradation-invariant chrominance components. This decomposition effectively mitigates weather-induced degradation while preserving color fidelity. To further enhance restoration quality, LGDM leverages degradation-related luminance information as a guiding condition, eliminating the need for explicit degradation prompts. Additionally, LGDM incorporates a \textit{Dynamic Time Step Loss} to optimize the denoising network, ensuring a balanced recovery of both low- and high-frequency features in the image. Finally, we present DriveWeather, a comprehensive all-weather driving dataset designed to enable robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, setting a new benchmark in AWIR.

Training such models effectively requires large-scale datasets that capture the diversity and context of gaming environments. However, existing datasets are often limited to specific domains or rely on artificial degradations, which do not accurately capture the unique characteristics of gaming content. Moreover, benchmarks for controllable video generation remain absent. To address these limitations, we introduce $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$, a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-view dataset specifically designed to overcome the shortcomings of current resources. Unlike existing datasets, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides diverse, high-fidelity gaming content rendered with Unreal Engine 5, offering authentic ground-truth LR-HR paired and multi-view frames across 80 scenes in 8 categories. It includes $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_MR}$ for super-resolution (SR), novel view synthesis (NVS), and combined NVS+SR tasks, and $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_{MS}}$, the first multi-style, object-level ground-truth set enabling research on controlled video generation. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art SR and NVS methods to establish performance baselines. While no existing approaches directly handle controlled video generation, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides a benchmark for advancing this area. By releasing the dataset, we aim to facilitate research in AI-powered restoration, compression, and controllable content generation for next-generation cloud gaming and entertainment.</p></details> |  |

However, adversarial training requires costly retraining, while adversarial purification often suffers from low efficiency. More critically, existing defenses are primarily designed under the perturbation-based adversarial threat model, which is ineffective against recently introduced unrestricted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient defense framework that counters both perturbation-based and unrestricted adversarial attacks. Our approach is motivated by the observation that adversarial examples typically lie near the decision boundary and are highly sensitive to pixel-level perturbations. To address this, we introduce adversarial anti-aliasing, a preprocessing technique that mitigates adversarial noise by reducing the magnitude of pixel-level perturbations. In addition, we propose adversarial super-resolution, which leverages prior knowledge from clean datasets to benignly restore high-quality images from adversarially degraded ones. Unlike image synthesis methods that generate entirely new images, adversarial super-resolution focuses on image restoration, making it more suitable for purification. Importantly, both techniques require no additional training and are computationally efficient since they do not rely on gradient computations. To further improve robustness across diverse datasets, we introduce a contrastive learning-based adversarial deblurring fine-tuning method. By incorporating adversarial priors during fine-tuning on the target dataset, this method enhances purification effectiveness without the need to retrain diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension. Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

RAM++ integrates high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen, extreme, and mixed degradations.

However, these datasets often differ significantly in resolution, style, and domain characteristics, leading to substantial domain gaps that hinder the development and fair evaluation of unified models. Furthermore, the lack of a large-scale, real-world all-in-one weather restoration dataset remains a critical bottleneck in advancing this field. To address these limitations, we present a real-world all-in-one adverse weather image restoration benchmark dataset, which contains image pairs captured under various weather conditions, including rain, snow, and haze, as well as diverse outdoor scenes and illumination settings. The resulting dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive experiments by benchmarking a variety of task-specific, task-general, and all-in-one restoration methods on our dataset. Our dataset offers a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical all-in-one image restoration in real-world scenarios.

Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance. The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the representation learning process, enabling better general information preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders. Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20%, reduces NMSE by around 50%, and enhances SSIM by 1%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly 1% in parameters.</p></details> |  |

The structure of the perturbations is investigated depending on the acceptable PSNR values and based on the Fourier power spectrum computations for the perturbations. It is demonstrated that moderate variation of image brightness ($\sim 10$ pixel units in a restricted region of an image can result in VMAF growth by $\sim 60\%$). Unlike some other methods demonstrating similar VMAF growth, the subjective quality of an image remains almost unchanged. It is also shown that the adversarial perturbations may demonstrate approximately linear dependence of perturbation amplitudes on the image brightness. The perturbations are studied based on the direct VMAF optimization in PyTorch. The significant discrepancies between the metric values and subjective judgements are also demonstrated when image restoration from noise is carried out using the same direct VMAF optimization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 40 figures |

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a knowledge distillation-driven and diffusion-enhanced (KDD) semantic non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), named KDD-SemNOMA, for multi-user uplink wireless image transmission. Specifically, to ensure robust feature transmission across diverse transmission conditions, we firstly develop a ConvNeXt-based deep joint source and channel coding architecture with enhanced adaptive feature module. This module incorporates signal-to-noise ratio and channel state information to dynamically adapt to additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, to improve image restoration quality without inference overhead, we introduce a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, i.e., a teacher model, trained on interference-free orthogonal transmission, guides a student model via feature affinity distillation and cross-head prediction distillation. Moreover, a diffusion model-based refinement stage leverages generative priors to transform initial SemNOMA outputs into high-fidelity images with enhanced perceptual quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-256 datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions. These results highlight the advantages in both pixel-level accuracy and perceptual metrics, effectively mitigating interference and enabling high-quality image recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations. We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity. Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under additional unknown degradations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on common model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling.

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics.

Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

Real-world pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable, stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual staining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Image Restoration and Enhancement: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09388v2)** | 2025-08-28 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2308.09388v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) has been an indispensable and challenging task in the low-level vision field, which strives to improve the subjective quality of images distorted by various forms of degradation. Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV |

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |

The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play (PnP) methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance as state-of-the-art PnP methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.

While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.</p></details> |  |

However, it faced challenges when it came to distinguishing between shadows and their backgrounds. To address this, we developed Deshadow-Anything, considering the generalization of large-scale datasets, and we performed Fine-tuning on large-scale datasets to achieve image shadow removal. The diffusion model can diffuse along the edges and textures of an image, helping to remove shadows while preserving the details of the image. Furthermore, we design Multi-Self-Attention Guidance (MSAG) and adaptive input perturbation (DDPM-AIP) to accelerate the iterative training speed of diffusion. Experiments on shadow removal tasks demonstrate that these methods can effectively improve image restoration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ne...</summary><p>We need to make major changes and re-upload</p></details> |

Although some methods combining traditional optimization algorithms with DNNs have been proposed, they all have some limitations. In this paper, we propose a three-granularity memory layer and contrast learning named MemoryNet, specifically, dividing the samples into positive, negative, and actual three samples for contrastive learning, where the memory layer is able to preserve the deep features of the image and the contrastive learning converges the learned features to balance. Experiments on Derain/Deshadow/Deblur task demonstrate that these methods are effective in improving restoration performance. In addition, this paper's model obtains significant PSNR, SSIM gain on three datasets with different degradation types, which is a strong proof that the recovered images are perceptually realistic.

The early face restoration methods mainly use statistical priors and degradation models, which are difficult to meet the requirements of real-world applications in practice. In recent years, face restoration has witnessed great progress after stepping into the deep learning era. However, there are few works to systematically study the deep learning based face restoration methods. Thus, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in deep learning techniques for face restoration. Specifically, we first summarize different problem formulations and analyze the characteristics of face images. Second, we discuss the challenges of face restoration. With regard to these challenges, we present a comprehensive review of recent FR methods, including prior-based methods and deep-learning methods. Then, we explore developed techniques in the task of FR covering network architectures, loss functions, and benchmark datasets. We also conduct a systematic benchmark evaluation on representative methods. Finally, we discuss the future directions including network designs, metrics, benchmark datasets, applications, etc. We also provide an open source repository for all the discussed methods, which is available at https://github.com/TaoWangzj/Awesome-Face-Restoration.</p></details> | 35 pages, 14 figures |

However, most existing methods are obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score. Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image restoration tasks.

Despite great advances in image restoration and enhancement in recent years, such systematic defects often cannot be restored by current state-of-the-art software features as available e.g. in Adobe Photoshop, but would require the incorporation of defect-aware priors into the underlying machine learning techniques. However, there are no publicly available datasets of autochromes with defect annotations. In this paper, we address these limitations and present the first approach that allows the automatic removal of greening color defects in digitized autochrome photographs. For this purpose, we introduce an approach for accurately simulating respective defects and use the respectively obtained synthesized data with its ground truth defect annotations to train a generative AI model with a carefully designed loss function that accounts for color imbalances between defected and non-defected areas. As demonstrated in our evaluation, our approach allows for the efficient and effective restoration of the considered defects, thereby overcoming limitations of alternative techniques that struggle with accurately reproducing original colors and may require significant manual effort.</p></details> |  |

We introduce NeuSee, the first computational imaging framework for high-fidelity sensor protection across the full visible spectrum. It jointly learns a neural representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. NeuSee system is adversarially trained end-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high as $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\textrm{sat}}$, the point at which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system leverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing, integrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for realistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account open-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and positions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions, and sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum imaging and laser suppression for the first time, with a 10.1\% improvement in restored image quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICCVW 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready, update Fig.4</p></details> |

However, license plate areas in dash cam images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework, MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR (RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments, MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms significantly contribute to these improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU), 2025</p></details> |

This study presents the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs), including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models, particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment. This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.</p></details> |  |

Adverse weather significantly degrades image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models, particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Underwater monitoring platforms rely on mainly visual data for marine biodiversity analysis, ecological assessment and autonomous exploration. However, underwater environments present significant challenges due to light scattering, absorption and turbidity, which degrade image clarity and distort colour information, which makes accurate observation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose DEEP-SEA, a novel deep learning-based underwater image restoration model to enhance both low- and high-frequency information while preserving spatial structures. The proposed Dual-Frequency Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial and Frequency Modulator aims to adaptively refine feature representations in frequency domains and simultaneously spatial information for better structural preservation. Our comprehensive experiments on EUVP and LSUI datasets demonstrate the superiority over the state of the art in restoring fine-grained image detail and structural consistency. By effectively mitigating underwater visual degradation, DEEP-SEA has the potential to improve the reliability of underwater monitoring platforms for more accurate ecological observation, species identification and autonomous navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, current explainable IQA methods not only inadequately use the same distortion criteria to evaluate both User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images, but also lack detailed quality analysis for monitoring image quality and guiding image restoration. In this study, we establish the first large-scale Visual Distortion Assessment Instruction Tuning Dataset for UGC images, termed ViDA-UGC, which comprises 11K images with fine-grained quality grounding, detailed quality perception, and reasoning quality description data. This dataset is constructed through a distortion-oriented pipeline, which involves human subject annotation and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assessment framework. This framework guides GPT-4o to generate quality descriptions by identifying and analyzing UGC distortions, which helps capturing rich low-level visual features that inherently correlate with distortion patterns. Moreover, we carefully select 476 images with corresponding 6,149 question answer pairs from ViDA-UGC and invite a professional team to ensure the accuracy and quality of GPT-generated information. The selected and revised data further contribute to the first UGC distortion assessment benchmark, termed ViDA-UGC-Bench. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ViDA-UGC and CoT framework for consistently enhancing various image quality analysis abilities across multiple base MLLMs on ViDA-UGC-Bench and Q-Bench, even surpassing GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose SNNSIR, a simple yet effective Spiking Neural Network for Stereo Image Restoration, specifically designed under the spike-driven paradigm where neurons transmit information through sparse, event-based binary spikes. In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on operations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are incompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed SNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and hardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of binary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic Block (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual learning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM) module introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication and highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation. Complementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further improves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature interaction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive experiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak removal, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution demonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. These results highlight the potential for real-time, low-power stereo vision applications. The code will be available after the article is accepted.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization, 1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures, leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; https://github.com/cszn/ConverseNet</p></details> |

Current image restoration methods struggle to handle complex degradation while maintaining efficiency. This paper introduces a novel image restoration architecture that combines multi-dimensional dynamic attention and self-attention within a U-Net framework. To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks.

However, a critical limitation of existing RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131 LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |

While State-Space Models like Mamba offer proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent 1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images, hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations, our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new paradigm for infrared image restoration.

While traditional IR methods have made notable progress by targeting individual degradation types, their specialization often comes at the cost of generalization, leaving them ill-equipped to handle the multifaceted distortions encountered in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance the convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we provide the first in-depth and systematic overview of AiOIR, delivering a structured taxonomy that categorizes existing methods by architectural designs, learning paradigms, and their core innovations. We systematically categorize current approaches and assess the challenges these models encounter, outlining research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. To facilitate the evaluation of existing methods, we also consolidate widely-used datasets, evaluation protocols, and implementation practices, and compare and summarize the most advanced open-source models. As the first comprehensive review dedicated to AiOIR, this paper aims to map the conceptual landscape, synthesize prevailing techniques, and ignite further exploration toward more intelligent, unified, and adaptable visual restoration systems.

In particular, recent advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type, resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with only 2.75M parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Sea-Undistort, a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 1200 paired 512x512 through-water scenes rendered in Blender. Each pair comprises a distortion-free and a distorted view, featuring realistic water effects such as sun glint, waves, and scattering over diverse seabeds. Accompanied by per-image metadata such as camera parameters, sun position, and average depth, Sea-Undistort enables supervised training that is otherwise infeasible in real environments. We use Sea-Undistort to benchmark two state-of-the-art image restoration methods alongside an enhanced lightweight diffusion-based framework with an early-fusion sun-glint mask. When applied to real aerial data, the enhanced diffusion model delivers more complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed, especially in deeper areas, reduces bathymetric errors, suppresses glint and scattering, and crisply restores fine seabed details.

However, existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF) scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition, the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205 high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, such as extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component, utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba, which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in both quality and versatility.</p></details> |  |

This generative machine-learning model explicitly mirrors the non-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. Unlike existing inverse solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a single reconstruction, the proposed latent-diffusion model generates multiple plausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scattered-field data, thereby generating several potential instances in the range-space of the non-unique inverse mapping. A forward electromagnetic solver is integrated into the reconstruction pipeline as a physics-based evaluation mechanism. The space of candidate reconstructions form a distribution of possibilities consistent with the conditioning data and the member of this space yielding the lowest scattered-field data discrepancy between the predicted and measured scattered fields is reported as the final solution. Synthetic and experimental labeled datasets are used for training and evaluation of the model. An innovative labeled synthetic dataset is created that exemplifies a varied set of scattering features. Training of the model using this new dataset produces high quality permittivity reconstructions achieving improved generalization with excellent fidelity to shape recognition. The results highlight the potential of hybrid generative physics frameworks as a promising direction for robust, data-driven microwave imaging.</p></details> |  |

We study the resulting computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and transparent proofs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration using zero-shot image-based diffusion models without retraining or modifying their architecture. We propose two complementary inference-time strategies: (1) Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) based on the neuroscience-inspired perceptual straightening hypothesis, which steers the diffusion denoising process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores, such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and perceptual straightness; and (2) Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which aims at reducing stochastic variation by ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity (distortion) scores, such as PSNR and SSIM, without sacrificing sharpness. Together, these training-free techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion models. We performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and degradation types, systematically evaluating each strategy to understand their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while PSG enhances temporal naturalness, particularly in case of temporal blur, MPES consistently improves fidelity and spatio-temporal perception--distortion trade-off across all tasks.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior works focused on photorealistic content generation, we target sparse, stylized, and view-consistent 3D vector sketches, a lightweight and interpretable medium well-suited for visual communication and prototyping. However, this task is very challenging: (i) no paired dataset exists for text and 3D (or 4D) sketches; (ii) sketches require structural abstraction that is difficult to model with conventional 3D representations like NeRFs or point clouds; and (iii) animating such sketches demands temporal coherence and multi-view consistency, which current pipelines do not address. Therefore, we propose 4-Doodle, the first training-free framework for generating dynamic 3D sketches from text. It leverages pretrained image and video diffusion models through a dual-space distillation scheme: one space captures multi-view-consistent geometry using differentiable B\'ezier curves, while the other encodes motion dynamics via temporally-aware priors. Unlike prior work (e.g., DreamFusion), which optimizes from a single view per step, our multi-view optimization ensures structural alignment and avoids view ambiguity, critical for sparse sketches. Furthermore, we introduce a structure-aware motion module that separates shape-preserving trajectories from deformation-aware changes, enabling expressive motion such as flipping, rotation, and articulated movement. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally realistic and structurally stable 3D sketch animations, outperforming existing baselines in both fidelity and controllability. We hope this work serves as a step toward more intuitive and accessible 4D content creation.</p></details> |  |

Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Our approach employs the FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions) model as the 3D face parametric representation, providing a unified framework for modeling face expressions and head pose. This not only enables precise extraction of motion features from driving videos, but also contributes to the faithful preservation of face shape and geometry. Specifically, we enhance the latent diffusion model with rich 3D expression and detailed pose information by incorporating depth maps, normal maps, and rendering maps derived from FLAME sequences. These maps serve as motion guidance and are encoded into the denoising UNet through a specifically designed Geometric Guidance Encoder (GGE). A multi-layer feature fusion module with integrated self-attention mechanisms is used to combine facial appearance and motion latent features within the spatial domain. By utilizing the 3D face parametric model as motion guidance, our method enables parametric alignment of face identity between the reference image and the motion captured from the driving video. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method excels at generating high-quality face animations with precise expression and head pose variation modeling. In addition, it demonstrates strong generalization performance on out-of-domain images. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/weimengting/MagicPortrait.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of generative modeling techniques for generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN). For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e., discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available at https://github.com/scu-zwh/TGBFN.</p></details> |  |

We prove that the discrete energy and its continuum counterpart differ by at most $O(\varepsilon)$; the prefactor involves only the $W^{1,1}$-norm of the connectivity density as $\varepsilon\to0$, so the error bound remains valid even when that density has strong local fluctuations. As an application, we introduce a neural-network procedure that reconstructs the connectivity density from edge-weight data and then embeds the resulting continuum model into a brain-dynamics framework. In this setting, the usual constant diffusion coefficient is replaced by the spatially varying coefficient produced by the learned density, yielding dynamics that differ significantly from those obtained with conventional constant-diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

A huge bottleneck is the attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However, existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. To address this concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. Experimental results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1% of the tokens during inference, outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and MInference.</p></details> | <details><summary>autho...</summary><p>author comment: This version was previously removed by arXiv administrators as the submitter did not have the rights to agree to the license at the time of submission.

This gap is counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning continuous gradients for discrete spaces. We include the code on the project page available here: https://patrickpynadath1.github.io/candi-lander</p></details> |  |

A key limitation lies in their reliance on the Markovian assumption, which restricts each step to condition only on the current state, leading to potential uncorrectable error accumulation. In this paper, we introduce CaDDi (Causal Discrete Diffusion Model), a discrete diffusion model that conditions on the entire generative trajectory, thereby lifting the Markov constraint and allowing the model to revisit and improve past states. By unifying sequential (causal) and temporal (diffusion) reasoning in a single non-Markovian transformer, CaDDi also treats standard causal language models as a special case and permits the direct reuse of pretrained LLM weights with no architectural changes. Empirically, CaDDi outperforms state-of-the-art discrete diffusion baselines on natural-language benchmarks, substantially narrowing the remaining gap to large autoregressive transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

The challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data. Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity.

Recent generative models, such as diffusion models for TS sampling and sequence-based architectures for product generation, offer faster alternatives to quantum-chemistry searches. But diffusion models remain constrained by their stochastic differential equation (SDE) dynamics, which suffer from inefficiency and limited controllability. We show that flow matching, a deterministic ordinary differential (ODE) formulation, can replace SDE-based diffusion for molecular and reaction generation. We introduce MolGEN, a conditional flow-matching framework that learns an optimal transport path to transport Gaussian priors to target chemical distributions. On benchmarks used by TSDiff and OA-ReactDiff, MolGEN surpasses TS geometry accuracy and barrier-height prediction while reducing sampling to sub-second inference. MolGEN also supports open-ended product generation with competitive top-k accuracy and avoids mass/electron-balance violations common to sequence models. In a realistic test on the $\gamma$-ketohydroperoxide decomposition network, MolGEN yields higher fractions of valid and intended TSs with markedly fewer quantum-chemistry evaluations than string-based baselines. These results demonstrate that deterministic flow matching provides a unified, accurate, and computationally efficient foundation for molecular generative modeling, signaling that flow matching is the future for molecular generation across chemistry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updates from the previous version: 1.

In camera-guided video generation with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free, frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase.

Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for potential publication in IEEE Wireless Communications</p></details> |

This success, however, has not translated as effectively to the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games, route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version from preprint arXiv:2506.07280 (Gen2Gen) focused on visual intelligence.

A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and a later time $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially, we find that $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size $n$, while $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$ becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model studied in the high-dimensional limit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an oral at Neurips 2025. 40 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |

Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its advantages over diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update V2: We added CIFAR experiments.

Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space. To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and utility preservation.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches for personalizing text-to-video generation suffer from tackling multiple subjects, which is a more challenging and practical scenario. In this work, our aim is to promote multi-subject guided text-to-video customization. We propose CustomVideo, a novel framework that can generate identity-preserving videos with the guidance of multiple subjects. To be specific, firstly, we encourage the co-occurrence of multiple subjects via composing them in a single image. Further, upon a basic text-to-video diffusion model, we design a simple yet effective attention control strategy to disentangle different subjects in the latent space of diffusion model. Moreover, to help the model focus on the specific area of the object, we segment the object from given reference images and provide a corresponding object mask for attention learning. Also, we collect a multi-subject text-to-video generation dataset as a comprehensive benchmark. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user study results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning.

Clinicians routinely encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended evaluations, ICL contributes only an 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, we observe that MLLMs are affected by a recency bias, where placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial performance improvements of up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks from context.

We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

At the same time, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in health coaching, yet CGM is rarely incorporated as a first-class signal. To address this gap, we conducted a six-week autoethnography, combining CGM with multimodal indicators captured via common digital devices and a chatbot that offered personalized reflections and explanations of glucose fluctuations. Our findings show how CGM-led, data-first multimodal tracking, coupled with conversational support, shaped everyday practices of diet, activity, stress, and wellbeing.

In this work, we present Open3D-VQA, a novel benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to reason about complex spatial relationships from an aerial perspective. The benchmark comprises 73k QA pairs spanning 7 general spatial reasoning tasks, including multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer formats, and supports both visual and point cloud modalities. The questions are automatically generated from spatial relations extracted from both real-world and simulated aerial scenes. Evaluation on 13 popular MLLMs reveals that: 1) Models are generally better at answering questions about relative spatial relations than absolute distances, 2) 3D LLMs fail to demonstrate significant advantages over 2D LLMs, and 3) Fine-tuning solely on the simulated dataset can significantly improve the model's spatial reasoning performance in real-world scenarios.

However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and multimodal inference.

However, prior work often overlooks the tight coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding. Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units, allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SenSys 2026</p></details> |

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning, existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1) Noise-Injected Exploration Policy: Perturbing visual inputs with Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual scenarios; and (2) Bayesian Advantage Estimation: Formulating advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones. Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

Understanding sarcastic image-text posts often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE} (\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts, selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Unlike prior methods that treat external knowledge as static input, MiDRE selectively adapts to when such knowledge is beneficial, mitigating the risks of hallucinated or irrelevant signals from large models. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales, revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions mainly focus on optimization- or data-based strategies but rarely exploit the information inherent in multimodal imbalance or conduct its quantitative analysis. To address this gap, we propose a novel quantitative analysis framework for Multimodal Imbalance and design a sample-level adaptive loss function. We define the Modality Gap as the Softmax score difference between modalities for the correct class and model its distribution using a bimodal Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM), representing balanced and imbalanced samples. Using Bayes' theorem, we estimate each sample's posterior probability of belonging to these two groups. Based on this, our adaptive loss (1) minimizes the overall Modality Gap, (2) aligns imbalanced samples with balanced ones, and (3) adaptively penalizes each according to its imbalance degree. A two-stage training strategy-warm-up and adaptive phases,yields state-of-the-art performance on CREMA-D (80.65%), AVE (70.40%), and KineticSound (72.42%). Fine-tuning with high-quality samples identified by the GMM further improves results, highlighting their value for effective multimodal fusion.</p></details> |  |

However, existing visual-question answering benchmarks fall short in evaluating these capabilities of MLLMs due to the lack of paired plain charts and visual-element-based questions. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes 5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying data but differing in visual presentations. We further design visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new opportunities for advancing MLLMs in infographic chart understanding.

We propose AdS-CLIP (Adapter-state Sharing in CLIP), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in the upper layers to preserve low-level unimodal representations in the lower layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where textual adapters guide visual ones to promote efficient cross-modal learning in the upper layers.

Our key design is to retain the original blocks while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and (2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn because the submission was premature and not agreed by all parties in collaboration</p></details> |

However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct responses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often leading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long chains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly strengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be improved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward model, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both visual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize the model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount of image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o, which is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure of CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge and generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal preference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision tasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection sampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally used for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize for correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision reward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>[Neur...</summary><p>[NeurIPS2025] Project Page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/think</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks fall short: they are largely single modality (text-only), span short time horizons, use shallow evidence, cover domains unevenly, and often omit full articles -- obscuring models' real-world capability. We present MMM-Fact, a large-scale benchmark of 125,449 fact-checked statements (1995--2025) across multiple domains, each paired with the full fact-check article and multimodal evidence (text, images, videos, tables) from four fact-checking sites and one news outlet. To reflect verification effort, each statement is tagged with a retrieval-difficulty tier -- Basic (1--5 sources), Intermediate (6--10), and Advanced (>10) -- supporting fairness-aware evaluation for multi-step, cross-modal reasoning. The dataset adopts a three-class veracity scheme (true/false/not enough information) and enables tasks in veracity prediction, explainable fact-checking, complex evidence aggregation, and longitudinal analysis. Baselines with mainstream LLMs show MMM-Fact is markedly harder than prior resources, with performance degrading as evidence complexity rises.

However, these models remain fragile or entirely incapable when extended to multi-modal tasks. Existing approaches largely rely on single-form captions, which lack diversity and often fail to adapt across different types of Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel for transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a modular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through an agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception agent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively distill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs) tailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM, which serves as a reasoning agent. Crucially, the translator and reasoner engage in multi-round feedback and interaction, enabling the extraction of targeted visual details and yielding more confident answers. Experiments on knowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, including MMMU and MIA-Bench, demonstrate that Seeing Eye not only reduces inference cost but also surpasses much larger end-to-end VLMs. For example, an instantiation combining a 3B-parameter vision translator with an 8B-parameter language reasoner outperforms a monolithic 32B VLM on challenging knowledge-based questions. Our results highlight that decoupling perception from reasoning via agent information flow offers a scalable and plug-and-play pathway to multimodal reasoning, allowing strong text-only LLMs to fully leverage their reasoning capabilities.

Existing approaches often fail to unify structural, semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting effective risk control.

Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B, achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs, FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.</p></details> |  |

We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM), a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality, and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |

As audiovisual media becomes a prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess multimodal RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/alexmartin1722/mirage</p></details> |

The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

Nevertheless, they struggle with varying compute resource availability (due to multi-tenancy, device heterogeneity, etc.) and fluctuating quality of inputs (from sensor feed corruption, environmental noise, etc.). Statically provisioned multimodal systems cannot adapt when compute resources change over time, while existing dynamic networks struggle with strict compute budgets. Additionally, both systems often neglect the impact of variations in modality quality. Consequently, modalities suffering substantial corruption may needlessly consume resources better allocated towards other modalities. We propose ADMN, a layer-wise Adaptive Depth Multimodal Network capable of tackling both challenges: it adjusts the total number of active layers across all modalities to meet strict compute resource constraints and continually reallocates layers across input modalities according to their modality quality. Our evaluations showcase ADMN can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art networks while reducing up to 75% of their floating-point operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2025</p></details> |

However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM) for better emotion recognition.

Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this, we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone. It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications.

This architecture enables highly efficient scaling (dramatically improving computational efficiency while significantly expanding model capacity) and empowers stronger unified multimodal intelligence across vision, speech, and language, representing a key step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to its predecessor, the upgraded version exhibits substantial improvements across multimodal understanding and generation. We significantly advance speech recognition capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in contextual ASR and highly competitive results in dialect-aware ASR. In image generation, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces high-fidelity text rendering and demonstrates marked gains in scene consistency and identity preservation during image editing. Furthermore, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces generative segmentation, a capability that not only achieves strong standalone segmentation performance but also enhances spatial control in image generation and improves editing consistency. Notably, Ming-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art results in text-to-image generation and generative segmentation, and sets new records on all 12 contextual ASR benchmarks, all within a single unified architecture.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.</p></details> | Under review |

OMCRG captures natural dyadic interactions and introduces new challenges in aligning generated audio with listeners' facial responses. To tackle these challenges, we incorporate text as an intermediate modality to connect audio and facial responses. We propose OmniResponse, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that autoregressively generates accurate multimodal listener responses. OmniResponse leverages a pretrained LLM enhanced with two core components: Chrono-Text Markup, which precisely timestamps generated text tokens, and TempoVoice, a controllable online text-to-speech (TTS) module that outputs speech synchronized with facial responses. To advance OMCRG research, we offer ResponseNet, a dataset of 696 detailed dyadic interactions featuring synchronized split-screen videos, multichannel audio, transcripts, and annotated facial behaviors. Comprehensive evaluations on ResponseNet demonstrate that OmniResponse outperforms baseline models in terms of semantic speech content, audio-visual synchronization, and generation quality.

Although it has been extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration. These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.</p></details> |  |

We propose a model that represents the text modality using an encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech component is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model. Our solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former consists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where the 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames, resulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these averaged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to merging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the CATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text and speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the CATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further improve model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during training, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a word error rate (WER) of 0.25 and a character error rate (CER) of 0.9 on the development set. On the test set, our model achieved WER and CER scores of 0.55 and 0.13, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Its prevalence in social media and popular culture poses persistent challenges for natural language understanding, sentiment analysis, and content moderation. With the emergence of multimodal large language models, sarcasm detection extends beyond text and requires integrating cues from audio and vision. We present MuSaG, the first German multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually selected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each instance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated separately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings. We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio, vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human annotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in conversational settings, models perform best on text. This highlights a gap in current multimodal models and motivates the use of MuSaG for developing models better suited to realistic scenarios. We release MuSaG publicly to support future research on multimodal sarcasm detection and human-model alignment.</p></details> |  |

The multimodal nature of video posts, combining visuals, audio, and text, allows for coordination across various modalities and complicates comparison between posts. This paper proposes an approach to detecting coordination that addresses these characteristic challenges. Our methodology, based on multilayer network analysis, is tailored to capture coordination across multiple modalities, and explicitly handles complex forms of similarity inherent in video and audio content. We test this approach on German political posts regarding the 2024 European Elections retrieved via the TikTok Research API. Our results demonstrate the ability of our approach to identify coordination within the constraints of the API, while also critically highlighting potential pitfalls and limitations.</p></details> |  |

While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop: Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle</p></details> |

While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to understand and trust model outputs. To address these limitations, this work first proposes a Region-Aware Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (RMCoT) dataset, in which the process of producing an answer is preceded by a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal.

For accurate heterogeneous semantic fusion, we design the cross-modal interaction and mapping blocks for robust unified representation, yielding the accurate aggregation of 3D genome knowledge. Besides, we introduce the first large-scale dataset comprising over 1 million pairwise samples of Hi-C contact maps and epigenomic tracks for high-quality pre-training, enabling the exploration of functional implications in 3D genomics. Extensive experiments show that MIX-HIC can significantly surpass existing state-of-the-art methods in diverse downstream tasks.

Existing benchmarks remain constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness, understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07, while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile, LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing methods in single editing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page:https://mined-lmm.github.io/</p></details> |

This paper presents a systematic literature review of 176 publications across different application domains (e.g., healthcare, education, and entertainment). Using a four-dimensional coding framework (application, technical, evaluative, and ethical), we find (1) frequent use of pattern recognition and information extraction from multimodal sources, but limited support for adaptive, interactive reasoning; (2) a dominant 'modality-to-text' pipeline that privileges language over rich audiovisual cues, striping away nuanced social cues; (3) evaluation practices reliant on static benchmarks, with socially grounded, human-centered assessments rare; and (4) Ethical discussions focused mainly on legal and rights-related risks (e.g., privacy), leaving societal risks (e.g., deception) overlooked--or at best acknowledged but left unaddressed. We outline a research agenda for evaluating socially competent, ethically informed, and interaction-aware multi-modal systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of multimodal collaboration remains under-exploited due to disparities in data quality and modality representation capabilities. To address this, we introduce DynCIM, a novel dynamic curriculum learning framework designed to quantify the inherent imbalances from both sample and modality perspectives. DynCIM employs a sample-level curriculum to dynamically assess each sample's difficulty according to prediction deviation, consistency, and stability, while a modality-level curriculum measures modality contributions from global and local. Furthermore, a gating-based dynamic fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust modality contributions, minimizing redundancy and optimizing fusion effectiveness. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarking datasets, spanning both bimodal and trimodal scenarios, demonstrate that DynCIM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach effectively mitigates modality and sample imbalances while enhancing adaptability and robustness in multimodal learning tasks.

Traditional fire modeling relies on manual interpretation by Fire Behaviour Analysts (FBAns) and static environmental data, often leading to inaccuracies and operational limitations. Emerging data sources, such as NASA's FIRMS satellite imagery and Volunteered Geographic Information, offer potential improvements by enabling dynamic fire spread prediction. This study proposes a Multimodal Fire Spread Prediction Framework (MFiSP) that integrates social media data and remote sensing observations to enhance forecast accuracy. By adapting fuel map manipulation strategies between assimilation cycles, the framework dynamically adjusts fire behavior predictions to align with the observed rate of spread. We evaluate the efficacy of MFiSP using synthetically generated fire event polygons across multiple scenarios, analyzing individual and combined impacts on forecast perimeters. Results suggest that our MFiSP integrating multimodal data can improve fire spread prediction beyond conventional methods reliant on FBAn expertise and static inputs.</p></details> |  |

Despite this need, existing medical AI systems disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements across diverse medical vision-language tasks.

Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.</p></details> |  |

Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods are designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research introduces ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel multimodal deep learning framework that classifies musculoskeletal risk using both visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. A custom multimodal dataset (MusDis-Sports) was created by combining images and skeletal coordinates, with each sample labeled into eight risk categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) system. ViSK-GAT integrates two innovative modules: the Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which refines inter-modal features via cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal alignment between image features and coordinates. The model achieved robust performance, with all key metrics exceeding 93%. Regression results also indicated a low RMSE of 0.1205 and MAE of 0.0156. ViSK-GAT consistently outperformed nine popular transfer learning backbones and showed its potential to advance AI-driven musculoskeletal risk assessment and enable early, impactful interventions in sports.</p></details> |  |

To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Each problem is paired with problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains, and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for advancing AI tutoring.</p></details> |  |

Yet, they are almost always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units. It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.</p></details> |  |

Rather than treating the brain as a homogeneous system, we grouped the seven functional networks into four clusters and trained separate multi-subject, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models for each. This architecture supports cluster-specific optimization and adaptive memory modeling, allowing each model to adjust temporal dynamics and modality weighting based on the functional role of its target network. Our results demonstrate that this clustered strategy significantly enhances prediction accuracy across the 1,000 cortical regions of the Schaefer atlas. The final model achieved an eighth-place ranking in the Algonauts Project 2025 Challenge, with out-of-distribution (OOD) correlation scores nearly double those of the baseline model used in the selection phase.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.

To fill this gap, we introduce PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models (<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores.

These maps enable detailed transfer of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies. In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from 3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the correspondence with feature fields.

We propose a novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism. Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in complex industrial scenes.</p></details> |  |

Based on these insights, we propose Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes.

However, conventional training relies on image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours, post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit 6.94$\rightarrow$7.25).

In this study, we propose a novel multimodal deep learning framework that uses cost-free, publicly available, unstructured data sources, including textual information, images, and sentiment scores, to generate credit scores that approximate commercial scorecards. Our framework adopts a two-phase approach. In the unimodal phase, we identify the best-performing models for each modality, i.e. BERT for text, VGG for image data, and a multilayer perceptron for sentiment-based features. In the fusion phase, we introduce the capsule-based fusion network (FusionCapsNet), a novel fusion strategy inspired by capsule networks, but fundamentally redesigned for multimodal integration. Unlike standard capsule networks, our method adapts a specific mechanism in capsule networks to each modality and restructures the fusion process to preserve spatial, contextual, and modality-specific information. It also enables adaptive weighting so that stronger modalities dominate without ignoring complementary signals. Our framework incorporates sentiment analysis across distinct news categories to capture borrower and market dynamics and employs GradCAM-based visualizations as an interpretability tool. These components are designed features of the framework, while our results later demonstrate that they effectively enrich contextual understanding and highlight the influential factors driving mortgage risk predictions. Our results show that our multimodal FusionCapsNet framework not only exceeds individual unimodal models but also outperforms benchmark fusion strategies such as addition, concatenation, and cross attention in terms of AUC, partial AUC, and F1 score, demonstrating clear gains in both predictive accuracy and interpretability for mortgage risk assessment.</p></details> |  |

Advances in training paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks. Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping, agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.</p></details> |  |

Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding (\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, this paper reveals that ID features are effective but have limited benefits in multimodal collaborative filtering recommendation. Therefore, this paper systematically deconstruct the pros and cons of ID features: (i) they provide initial embedding but lack semantic richness, (ii) they provide a unique identifier for each user and item but hinder generalization to untrained data, and (iii) they assist in aligning and fusing multimodal features but may lead to representation shift. Based on these insights, this paper proposes IDFREE, an ID-free multimodal collaborative Filtering REcommEndation baseline. IDFREE replaces ID features with multimodal features and positional encodings to generate semantically meaningful ID-free embeddings. For ID-free multimodal collaborative filtering, it further proposes an adaptive similarity graph module to construct dynamic user-user and item-item graphs based on multimodal features. Then, an augmented user-item graph encoder is proposed to construct more effective user and item encoding. Finally, IDFREE achieves inter-multimodal alignment based on the contrastive learning and uses Softmax loss as recommendation loss. Basic experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that IDFREE outperforms existing ID-based MCFRec methods, achieving an average performance gain of 72.24% across standard metrics (Recall@5, 10, 20, 50 and NDCG@5, 10, 20, 50). Exploratory and extended experiments further validate our findings on the limitations of ID features in MCFRec.

| **[Task-Oriented Feature Compression for Multimodal Understanding via Device-Edge Co-Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12926v3)** | 2025-10-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.12926v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large multimodal models (LMMs), multimodal understanding applications are emerging. As most LMM inference requests originate from edge devices with limited computational capabilities, the predominant inference pipeline involves directly forwarding the input data to an edge server which handles all computations. However, this approach introduces high transmission latency due to limited uplink bandwidth of edge devices and significant computation latency caused by the prohibitive number of visual tokens, thus hindering delay-sensitive tasks and degrading user experience. To address this challenge, we propose a task-oriented feature compression (TOFC) method for multimodal understanding in a device-edge co-inference framework, where visual features are merged by clustering and encoded by a learnable and selective entropy model before feature projection. Specifically, we employ density peaks clustering based on K nearest neighbors to reduce the number of visual features, thereby minimizing both data transmission and computational complexity. Subsequently, a learnable entropy model with hyperprior is utilized to encode and decode merged features, further reducing transmission overhead. To enhance compression efficiency, multiple entropy models are adaptively selected based on the characteristics of the visual features, enabling a more accurate estimation of the probability distribution. Comprehensive experiments on seven visual question answering benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFC method. Results show that TOFC achieves up to 52% reduction in data transmission overhead and 63% reduction in system latency while maintaining identical task performance, compared with neural compression ELIC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

This results in misaligned local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model aggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features across clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing input features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in learned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side embedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns. These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally aggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more effective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be algorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to enhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global representation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks with diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\% performance improvement under severe data incompleteness. The method is also supported by a theoretical analysis with an explicit performance bound that matches our empirical observations.

Identifying these parts is key to performing fine-grained, compositional reasoning-yet, large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to perform this seemingly straightforward task. In this work, we introduce PARTONOMY, an LMM benchmark designed for pixel-level part grounding. We construct PARTONOMY from existing part datasets and our own rigorously annotated set of images, encompassing 862 part labels and 534 object labels for evaluation. Unlike existing datasets that simply ask models to identify generic parts, PARTONOMY uses specialized concepts (e.g., agricultural airplane), and challenges models to compare objects' parts, consider part-whole relationships, and justify textual predictions with visual segmentations. Our experiments demonstrate significant limitations in state-of-the-art LMMs (e.g., LISA-13B achieves only 5.9% gIoU), highlighting a critical gap in their part grounding abilities. We note that existing segmentation-enabled LMMs (segmenting LMMs) have two key architectural shortcomings: they use special [SEG] tokens not seen during pretraining which induce distribution shift, and they discard predicted segmentations instead of using past predictions to guide future ones. To address these deficiencies, we train several part-centric LMMs and propose PLUM, a novel segmenting LMM that uses span tagging instead of segmentation tokens and that conditions on prior predictions in a feedback loop. We find that pretrained PLUM outperforms existing segmenting LMMs on reasoning segmentation, VQA, and visual hallucination benchmarks. In addition, PLUM finetuned on our proposed Explanatory Part Segmentation task is competitive with segmenting LMMs trained on significantly more segmentation data. Our work opens up new avenues towards enabling fine-grained, grounded visual understanding in LMMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight; project page: https://wjdghks950.github.io/partonomy.github.io/</p></details> |

We systematize a model-agnostic pipeline that (i) projects heterogeneous last-layer states from text-layout-vision encoders into token-type-aware document vectors and (ii) performs clustering with centroid- or density-based methods, including an HDBSCAN + $k$-NN assignment to eliminate unlabeled points. We evaluate eight encoders (text-only, layout-aware, vision-only, and vision-language) with $k$-Means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN + $k$-NN, and BIRCH on five corpora spanning clean synthetic invoices, their heavily degraded print-and-scan counterparts, scanned receipts, and real identity and certificate documents. The study reveals modality-specific failure modes and a robustness-accuracy trade-off, with vision features nearly solving template discovery on clean pages while text dominates under covariate shift, and fused encoders offering the best balance. We detail a reproducible, oracle-free tuning protocol and the curated evaluation settings to guide future work on unsupervised document organization.</p></details> | 24 pages, 12 figures |

A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial, subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust, preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive multimodal content.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix, PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods.

However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 UniReps Workshop</p></details> |

In response to this growing threat, several works have preliminarily explored countermeasures. However, the lack of sufficient and diverse training data, along with the absence of a standardized benchmark, hinder deeper exploration. To address this challenge, we first build Mega-MMDF, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset for multimodal deepfake detection. Specifically, we employ 21 forgery pipelines through the combination of 10 audio forgery methods, 12 visual forgery methods, and 6 audio-driven face reenactment methods. Mega-MMDF currently contains 0.1 million real samples and 1.1 million forged samples, making it one of the largest and most diverse multimodal deepfake datasets, with plans for continuous expansion. Building on it, we present DeepfakeBench-MM, the first unified benchmark for multimodal deepfake detection. It establishes standardized protocols across the entire detection pipeline and serves as a versatile platform for evaluating existing methods as well as exploring novel approaches. DeepfakeBench-MM currently supports 5 datasets and 11 multimodal deepfake detectors. Furthermore, our comprehensive evaluations and in-depth analyses uncover several key findings from multiple perspectives (e.g., augmentation, stacked forgery). We believe that DeepfakeBench-MM, together with our large-scale Mega-MMDF, will serve as foundational infrastructures for advancing multimodal deepfake detection.</p></details> | Preprint |

To address this gap, we introduce DVL-Suite, a comprehensive framework for analyzing long-term urban dynamics through remote sensing imagery. Our suite comprises 14,871 high-resolution (1.0m) multi-temporal images spanning 42 major cities in the U.S. from 2005 to 2023, organized into two components: DVL-Bench and DVL-Instruct. The DVL-Bench includes six urban understanding tasks, from fundamental change detection (pixel-level) to quantitative analyses (regional-level) and comprehensive urban narratives (scene-level), capturing diverse urban dynamics including expansion/transformation patterns, disaster assessment, and environmental challenges. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal their limitations in long-term temporal understanding and quantitative analysis. These challenges motivate the creation of DVL-Instruct, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset designed to enhance models' capabilities in multi-temporal Earth observation. Building upon this dataset, we develop DVLChat, a baseline model capable of both image-level question-answering and pixel-level segmentation, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of city dynamics through language interactions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Recent MCoT methods fall into two categories: (i) Textual-MCoT (T-MCoT), which takes multimodal input and produces textual output; and (ii) Interleaved-MCoT (I-MCoT), which generates interleaved image-text outputs. Despite advances in both approaches, the mechanisms driving these improvements are not fully understood. To fill this gap, we first reveal that MCoT boosts LVLMs by incorporating visual thoughts, which convey image information to the reasoning process regardless of the MCoT format, depending only on clarity and conciseness of expression. Furthermore, to explore visual thoughts systematically, we define four distinct forms of visual thought expressions and analyze them comprehensively. Our findings demonstrate that these forms differ in clarity and conciseness, yielding varying levels of MCoT improvement. Additionally, we explore the internal nature of visual thoughts, finding that visual thoughts serve as intermediaries between the input image and reasoning to deeper transformer layers, enabling more advanced visual information transmission. We hope that the visual thoughts can inspire further breakthroughs for future MCoT research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025;</p></details> |

While post-training quantization (PTQ) has successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80 players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods (erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions.

Conventional retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional, and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines, highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation.</p></details> | Preprint |

This is expected for MIDI, where performance reaches saturation, but more surprising for audio, where LogicLM, despite near-perfect MIDI accuracy, remains notably brittle. Among models, Gemini Pro achieves the highest performance across most conditions. Overall, current systems reason well over symbols (MIDI) but do not yet "listen" reliably from audio.

In this work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29 hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings, featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with 84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time.

To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality without requiring explicit modality generation or auxiliary networks. To efficiently learn these approximations with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning.

Multimodal diagnostic approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 8 figures, and 7 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes, and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved. Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability, as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Most existing approaches rely heavily on identity-sensitive information, such as facial expressions and speech, which raises concerns about personal privacy. To address this, we introduce the De-identity Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning (DEEMO), a novel task designed to enable emotion understanding using de-identified video and audio inputs. The DEEMO dataset consists of two subsets: DEEMO-NFBL, which includes rich annotations of Non-Facial Body Language (NFBL), and DEEMO-MER, an instruction dataset for Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning using identity-free cues. This design supports emotion understanding without compromising identity privacy. In addition, we propose DEEMO-LLaMA, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates de-identified audio, video, and textual information to enhance both emotion recognition and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that DEEMO-LLaMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, outperforming existing MLLMs by a significant margin, achieving 74.49% accuracy and 74.45% F1-score in de-identity emotion recognition, and 6.20 clue overlap and 7.66 label overlap in de-identity emotion reasoning. Our work contributes to ethical AI by advancing privacy-preserving emotion understanding and promoting responsible affective computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |

For instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Findings; The first two authors contributed equally; Github link: https://github.com/Yui010206/MEXA</p></details> |

For the interactions to be seamless, the agents need to analyse social scenes and behavioural cues from their (robot's) perspective. Works that model human-agent interactions in social situations are few; and even those existing ones are computationally too intensive to be deployed in real time or perform poorly in real-world scenarios when only limited information is available. We propose a knowledge distillation framework that models social interactions through various multimodal cues, and yet is robust against incomplete and noisy information during inference. We train a teacher model with multimodal input (body, face and hand gestures, gaze, raw images) that transfers knowledge to a student model which relies solely on body pose. Extensive experiments on two publicly available human-robot interaction datasets demonstrate that our student model achieves an average accuracy gain of 14.75% over competitive baselines on multiple downstream social understanding tasks, even with up to 51% of its input being corrupted. The student model is also highly efficient - less than 1% in size of the teacher model in terms of parameters and its latency is 11.9% of the teacher model.

Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended.</p></details> |  |

Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored. Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce VisualToolBench, a visual tool-use reasoning benchmark that rigorously evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under the think-with-images paradigm. VisualToolBench comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with images, VisualToolBench offers critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) tailored for TCM has highlighted the urgent need for an objective and comprehensive evaluation framework to assess their performance on real-world tasks. However, existing evaluation datasets are limited in scope and primarily text-based, lacking a unified and standardized multimodal question-answering (QA) benchmark. To address this issue, we introduce TCM-Ladder, the first comprehensive multimodal QA dataset specifically designed for evaluating large TCM language models. The dataset covers multiple core disciplines of TCM, including fundamental theory, diagnostics, herbal formulas, internal medicine, surgery, pharmacognosy, and pediatrics. In addition to textual content, TCM-Ladder incorporates various modalities such as images and videos. The dataset was constructed using a combination of automated and manual filtering processes and comprises over 52,000 questions. These questions include single-choice, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, diagnostic dialogue, and visual comprehension tasks. We trained a reasoning model on TCM-Ladder and conducted comparative experiments against nine state-of-the-art general domain and five leading TCM-specific LLMs to evaluate their performance on the dataset. Moreover, we propose Ladder-Score, an evaluation method specifically designed for TCM question answering that effectively assesses answer quality in terms of terminology usage and semantic expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically evaluate mainstream general domain and TCM-specific LLMs on a unified multimodal benchmark. The datasets and leaderboard are publicly available at https://tcmladder.com and will be continuously updated.</p></details> |  |

Existing NLRec approaches often use Dense Retrieval (DR) to compute item relevance scores from aggregation of inner products between user request embeddings and relevant passage embeddings. However, DR views the request as the sole relevance label, thus leading to a unimodal scoring function centered on the query embedding that is often a weak proxy for query relevance. To better capture the potential multimodal distribution of the relevance scoring function that may arise from complex NLRec data, we propose GPR-LLM that uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with LLM relevance judgments for a subset of candidate passages. Experiments on four NLRec datasets and two LLM backbones demonstrate that GPR-LLM with an RBF kernel, capable of modeling multimodal relevance scoring functions, consistently outperforms simpler unimodal kernels (dot product, cosine similarity), as well as baseline methods including DR, cross-encoder, and pointwise LLM-based relevance scoring by up to 65%. Overall, GPR-LLM provides an efficient and effective approach to NLRec within a minimal LLM labeling budget.</p></details> | 16 pages,20 figures |

AlphaFold2 protein structures are available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling. Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest PPI prediction performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy). The framework also achieved 77.42% accuracy for enzyme classification and 86.04% accuracy for protein family classification.

These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts, such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored. Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder, with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.</p></details> |  |

Understanding the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50 companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves 46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds.

We propose MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion, we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a 27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular representation.

While existing methods rely heavily on structured ontologies or similarity-based techniques, they often lack the flexibility to express structure-free functional descriptions and novel biological functions. In this work, we introduce Prot2Text-V2, a novel multimodal sequence-to-text model that generates free-form natural language descriptions of protein function directly from amino acid sequences. Our method combines a protein language model as a sequence encoder (ESM-3B) and a decoder-only language model (LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct) through a lightweight nonlinear modality projector. A key innovation is our Hybrid Sequence-level Contrastive Alignment Learning (H-SCALE), which improves cross-modal learning by matching mean- and std-pooled protein embeddings with text representations via contrastive loss. After the alignment phase, we apply instruction-based fine-tuning using LoRA on the decoder to teach the model how to generate accurate protein function descriptions conditioned on the protein sequence. We train Prot2Text-V2 on about 250K curated entries from SwissProt and evaluate it under low-homology conditions, where test sequences have low similarity with training samples. Prot2Text-V2 consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across various metrics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |

However, traditional encoding schemes, such as binary or numerical representations, often fail to straightforwardly capture the intricate structural properties of networks. Through employing the image-based encoding to preserve topological context, this study utilizes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as evolutionary operators to facilitate structure-aware optimization over graph data. To address the visual clutter inherent in large-scale network visualizations, we leverage graph sparsification techniques to simplify structures while maintaining essential structural features. To further improve robustness and mitigate bias from different sparsification views, we propose a cooperative evolutionary optimization framework that facilitates cross-domain knowledge transfer and unifies multiple sparsified variants of diverse structures. Additionally, recognizing the sensitivity of MLLMs to network layout, we introduce an ensemble strategy that aggregates outputs from various layout configurations through consensus voting. Finally, experiments on real-world networks through various tasks demonstrate that our approach improves both the quality and reliability of solutions in MLLM-driven evolutionary optimization.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understanding tasks, focusing on how visual information is processed and transferred to the textual domain. We compare native multimodal VLMs, models trained from scratch on multimodal data to generate both text and images, and non-native multimodal VLMs, models adapted from pre-trained large language models or capable of generating only text, highlighting key differences in information flow. We find that in native multimodal VLMs, image and text embeddings are more separated within the residual stream. Moreover, VLMs differ in how visual information reaches text: non-native multimodal VLMs exhibit a distributed communication pattern, where information is exchanged through multiple image tokens, whereas models trained natively for joint image and text generation tend to rely on a single post-image token that acts as a narrow gate for visual information. We show that ablating this single token significantly deteriorates image-understanding performance, whereas targeted, token-level interventions reliably steer image semantics and downstream text with fine-grained control.</p></details> |  |

Due to the lack of available quality-rated medical images, most commonly used IQA methods employing reference images (i.e. full-reference IQA) have been developed and tested for natural images. Reported application inconsistencies arising when employing such measures for medical images are not surprising, as they rely on different properties than natural images. In photoacoustic imaging (PAI), especially, standard benchmarking approaches for assessing the quality of image reconstructions are lacking. PAI is a multi-physics imaging modality, in which two inverse problems have to be solved, which makes the application of IQA measures uniquely challenging due to both, acoustic and optical, artifacts. To support the development and testing of full- and no-reference IQA measures we assembled PhotIQA, a data set consisting of 1134 reconstructed photoacoustic (PA) images that were rated by 2 experts across five quality properties (overall quality, edge visibility, homogeneity, inclusion and background intensity), where the detailed rating enables usage beyond PAI. To allow full-reference assessment, highly characterised imaging test objects were used, providing a ground truth. Our baseline experiments show that HaarPSI$_{med}$ significantly outperforms SSIM in correlating with the quality ratings (SRCC: 0.83 vs. 0.62). The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13325196.</p></details> | 12 pages |

No-reference image quality measures are often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and code are publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388429.</p></details> |  |
| **[Super-temporal-resolution Photoacoustic Imaging with Dynamic Reconstruction through Implicit Neural Representation in Sparse-view](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03175v1)** | 2025-05-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03175v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is an important imaging technique for monitoring physiological processes, capable of providing high-contrast images of optical absorption at much greater depths than traditional optical imaging methods. However, practical instrumentation and geometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the imaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data, produce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not consider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution is crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by the low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser technology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by characterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to improve dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and enhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input. Specifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as implicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the network are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the need for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong implicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit regularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms traditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions, effectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.</p></details> |  |

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |

Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab.

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images.

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.13080v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Deep neural networks have great potential in medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnosis and other healthcare issues, and is promoted in both pre-clinical and even clinical stages. In this review, we performed an overview of some new developments and challenges in the application of machine learning to medical image analysis, with a special focus on deep learning in photoacoustic imaging. The aim of this review is threefold: (i) introducing deep learning with some important basics, (ii) reviewing recent works that apply deep learning in the entire ecological chain of photoacoustic imaging, from image reconstruction to disease diagnosis, (iii) providing some open source materials and other resources for researchers interested in applying deep learning to photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A review of deep learning for photoacoustic imaging</p></details> |

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
