| **[ExDBN: Exact learning of Dynamic Bayesian Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16100v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal learning from data has received much attention in recent years. One way of capturing causal relationships is by utilizing Bayesian networks. There, one recovers a weighted directed acyclic graph, in which random variables are represented by vertices, and the weights associated with each edge represent the strengths of the causal relationships between them. This concept is extended to capture dynamic effects by introducing a dependency on past data, which may be captured by the structural equation model, which is utilized in the present contribution to formulate a score-based learning approach. A mixed-integer quadratic program is formulated and an algorithmic solution proposed, in which the pre-generation of exponentially many acyclicity constraints is avoided by utilizing the so-called branch-and-cut ("lazy constraint") method. Comparing the novel approach to the state of the art, we show that the proposed approach turns out to produce excellent results when applied to small and medium-sized synthetic instances of up to 25 time-series. Lastly, two interesting applications in bio-science and finance, to which the method is directly applied, further stress the opportunities in developing highly accurate, globally convergent solvers that can handle modest instances.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16032v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiRC: Joint Learning for Time Series Anomaly Prediction and Detection with Multi-scale Reconstructive Contrast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15997v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many methods have been proposed for unsupervised time series anomaly detection. Despite some progress, research on predicting future anomalies is still relatively scarce. Predicting anomalies is particularly challenging due to the diverse reaction time and the lack of labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose MultiRC to integrate reconstructive and contrastive learning for joint learning of anomaly prediction and detection, with multi-scale structure and adaptive dominant period mask to deal with the diverse reaction time. MultiRC also generates negative samples to provide essential training momentum for the anomaly prediction tasks and prevent model degradation. We evaluate seven benchmark datasets from different fields. For both anomaly prediction and detection tasks, MultiRC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15982v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) estimates a function from its pointwise incomplete observations. In particular, this method can be used to estimate the state of a dynamical system from observational data gathered by sensors. However, when the number of observations are limited, DEIM returns large estimation errors. Sparse DEIM (S-DEIM) was recently developed to address this problem by introducing a kernel vector which previous DEIM-based methods had ignored. Unfortunately, estimating the optimal kernel vector in S-DEIM is a difficult task. Here, we introduce a data-driven method to estimate this kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this machine learning approach together with S-DEIM leads to nearly optimal state estimations.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-ACL: A Time Series Analytic Continual Learning Framework for Privacy-Preserving and Class-Incremental Pattern Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15954v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental Learning (CIL) in Time Series Classification (TSC) aims to incrementally train models using the streaming time series data that arrives continuously. The main problem in this scenario is catastrophic forgetting, i.e., training models with new samples inevitably leads to the forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Among existing methods, the replay-based methods achieve satisfactory performance but compromise privacy, while exemplar-free methods protect privacy but suffer from low accuracy. However, more critically, owing to their reliance on gradient-based update techniques, these existing methods fundamentally cannot solve the catastrophic forgetting problem. In TSC scenarios with continuously arriving data and temporally shifting distributions, these methods become even less practical. In this paper, we propose a Time Series Analytic Continual Learning framework, called TS-ACL. Inspired by analytical learning, TS-ACL transforms neural network updates into gradient-free linear regression problems, thereby fundamentally mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, employing a pre-trained and frozen feature extraction encoder, TS-ACL only needs to update its analytic classifier recursively in a lightweight manner that is highly suitable for real-time applications and large-scale data processing. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate that the model obtained recursively through the TS-ACL is exactly equivalent to a model trained on the complete dataset in a centralized manner, thereby establishing the property of absolute knowledge memory. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our TS-ACL.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[ProbTS: Benchmarking Point and Distributional Forecasting across Diverse Prediction Horizons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07446v5)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Delivering precise point and distributional forecasts across a spectrum of prediction horizons represents a significant and enduring challenge in the application of time-series forecasting within various industries. Prior research on developing deep learning models for time-series forecasting has often concentrated on isolated aspects, such as long-term point forecasting or short-term probabilistic estimations. This narrow focus may result in skewed methodological choices and hinder the adaptability of these models to uncharted scenarios. While there is a rising trend in developing universal forecasting models, a thorough understanding of their advantages and drawbacks, especially regarding essential forecasting needs like point and distributional forecasts across short and long horizons, is still lacking. In this paper, we present ProbTS, a benchmark tool designed as a unified platform to evaluate these fundamental forecasting needs and to conduct a rigorous comparative analysis of numerous cutting-edge studies from recent years. We dissect the distinctive data characteristics arising from disparate forecasting requirements and elucidate how these characteristics can skew methodological preferences in typical research trajectories, which often fail to fully accommodate essential forecasting needs. Building on this, we examine the latest models for universal time-series forecasting and discover that our analyses of methodological strengths and weaknesses are also applicable to these universal models. Finally, we outline the limitations inherent in current research and underscore several avenues for future exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |
| **[LiMTR: Time Series Motion Prediction for Diverse Road Users through Multimodal Feature Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15819v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the behavior of road users accurately is crucial to enable the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in urban or densely populated areas. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in time series motion prediction research, leading to significant advancements in state-of-the-art techniques in recent years. However, the potential of using LiDAR data to capture more detailed local features, such as a person's gaze or posture, remains largely unexplored. To address this, we develop a novel multimodal approach for motion prediction based on the PointNet foundation model architecture, incorporating local LiDAR features. Evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset shows a performance improvement of 6.20% and 1.58% in minADE and mAP respectively, when integrated and compared with the previous state-of-the-art MTR. We open-source the code of our LiMTR model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2024 workshop Time Series in the Age of Large Models.

| **[A Unified Approach to Extract Interpretable Rules from Tree Ensembles via Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00843v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree ensemble methods represent a popular machine learning model, known for their effectiveness in supervised classification and regression tasks. Their performance derives from aggregating predictions of multiple decision trees, which are renowned for their interpretability properties. However, tree ensemble methods do not reliably exhibit interpretable output. Our work aims to extract an optimized list of rules from a trained tree ensemble, providing the user with a condensed, interpretable model that retains most of the predictive power of the full model. Our approach consists of solving a clean and neat set partitioning problem formulated through Integer Programming. The proposed method works with either tabular or time series data, for both classification and regression tasks, and does not require parameter tuning under the most common setting. Through rigorous computational experiments, we offer statistically significant evidence that our method is competitive with other rule extraction methods and effectively handles time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>- Fix...</summary><p>- Fixed several typos - Related work have been expanded - Discussion of computational results has been improved for clearness</p></details> |
| **[FoundTS: Comprehensive and Unified Benchmarking of Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11802v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is key functionality in numerous fields, including in finance, weather services, and energy management. While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design. We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FoundTS-C2B0.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning of Disentangled Representations for Multivariate Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12606v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series data in fields like healthcare and industry are informative but challenging due to high dimensionality and lack of labels. Recent self-supervised learning methods excel in learning rich representations without labels but struggle with disentangled embeddings and inductive bias issues like transformation-invariance. To address these challenges, we introduce TimeDRL, a framework for multivariate time-series representation learning with dual-level disentangled embeddings. TimeDRL features: (i) disentangled timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) timestamp-predictive and instance-contrastive tasks for representation learning; and (iii) avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases. Experiments on forecasting and classification datasets show TimeDRL outperforms existing methods, with further validation in semi-supervised settings with limited labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission has been withdrawn to avoid duplication with a full version of the paper that is already available in another arXiv entry (arXiv:2410.12606).

| **[Diffusion-TS: Interpretable Diffusion for General Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01742v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are becoming the leading paradigm for generative models. It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[XForecast: Evaluating Natural Language Explanations for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14180v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting aids decision-making, especially for stakeholders who rely on accurate predictions, making it very important to understand and explain these models to ensure informed decisions. Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which underline feature or temporal importance, often require expert knowledge. In contrast, natural language explanations (NLEs) are more accessible to laypeople. However, evaluating forecast NLEs is difficult due to the complex causal relationships in time series data. To address this, we introduce two new performance metrics based on simulatability, assessing how well a human surrogate can predict model forecasts using the explanations. Experiments show these metrics differentiate good from poor explanations and align with human judgments. Utilizing these metrics, we further evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate explanations for time series data, finding that numerical reasoning, rather than model size, is the main factor influencing explanation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSMT: Few-Shot Traffic Forecasting with Single Source Meta-Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15589v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is vital for intelligent traffic prediction. Yet, ITS often relies on data from traffic sensors or vehicle devices, where certain cities might not have all those smart devices or enabling infrastructures. Also, recent studies have employed meta-learning to generalize spatial-temporal traffic networks, utilizing data from multiple cities for effective traffic forecasting for data-scarce target cities. However, collecting data from multiple cities can be costly and time-consuming. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Single Source Meta-Transfer Learning (SSMT) which relies only on a single source city for traffic prediction. Our method harnesses this transferred knowledge to enable few-shot traffic forecasting, particularly when the target city possesses limited data. Specifically, we use memory-augmented attention to store the heterogeneous spatial knowledge from the source city and selectively recall them for the data-scarce target city. We extend the idea of sinusoidal positional encoding to establish meta-learning tasks by leveraging diverse temporal traffic patterns from the source city. Moreover, to capture a more generalized representation of the positions we introduced a meta-positional encoding that learns the most optimal representation of the temporal pattern across all the tasks. We experiment on five real-world benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our method outperforms several existing methods in time series traffic prediction.</p></details> | ICPR 2024 |
| **[Accelerated Sub-Image Search For Variable-Size Patches Identification Based On Virtual Time Series Transformation And Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15425v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses two tasks: (i) fixed-size objects such as hay bales are to be identified in an aerial image for a given reference image of the object, and (ii) variable-size patches such as areas on fields requiring spot spraying or other handling are to be identified in an image for a given small-scale reference image. Both tasks are related. The second differs in that identified sub-images similar to the reference image are further clustered before patches contours are determined by solving a traveling salesman problem. Both tasks are complex in that the exact number of similar sub-images is not known a priori. The main discussion of this paper is presentation of an acceleration mechanism for sub-image search that is based on a transformation of an image to multivariate time series along the RGB-channels and subsequent segmentation to reduce the 2D search space in the image. Two variations of the acceleration mechanism are compared to exhaustive search on diverse synthetic and real-world images. Quantitatively, proposed method results in solve time reductions of up to 2 orders of magnitude, while qualitatively delivering comparative visual results. Proposed method is neural network-free and does not use any image pre-processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Contrastive Learning for Time Series Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15416v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding events in time series is an important task in a variety of contexts. However, human analysis and labeling are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is advantageous to learn embeddings for moments in time series in an unsupervised way, which allows for good performance in classification or detection tasks after later minimal human labeling. In this paper, we propose dynamic contrastive learning (DynaCL), an unsupervised contrastive representation learning framework for time series that uses temporal adjacent steps to define positive pairs. DynaCL adopts N-pair loss to dynamically treat all samples in a batch as positive or negative pairs, enabling efficient training and addressing the challenges of complicated sampling of positives. We demonstrate that DynaCL embeds instances from time series into semantically meaningful clusters, which allows superior performance on downstream tasks on a variety of public time series datasets. Our findings also reveal that high scores on unsupervised clustering metrics do not guarantee that the representations are useful in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Science Time Series: Deep Learning in Hydrology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15218v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research is part of a systematic study of scientific time series. In the last three years, hundreds of papers and over fifty new deep-learning models have been described for time series models. These mainly focus on the key aspect of time dependence, whereas in some scientific time series, the situation is more complex with multiple locations, each location having multiple observed and target time-dependent streams and multiple exogenous (known) properties that are either constant or time-dependent. Here, we analyze the hydrology time series using the CAMELS and Caravan global datasets on catchment rainfall and runoff. Together, these have up to 6 observed streams and up to 209 static parameters defined at each of about 8000 locations. This analysis is fully open source with a Jupyter Notebook running on Google Colab for both an LSTM-based analysis and the data engineering preprocessing. Our goal is to investigate the importance of exogenous data, which we look at using eight different choices on representative hydrology tasks. Increasing the exogenous information significantly improves the data representation, with the mean square error decreasing to 60% of its initial value in the largest dataset examined. We present the initial results of studies of other deep-learning neural network architectures where the approaches that can use the full observed and exogenous observations outperform less flexible methods, including Foundation models. Using the natural annual periodic exogenous time series produces the largest impact, but the static and other periodic exogenous streams are also important. Our analysis is intended to be valuable as an educational resource and benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Future-Guided Learning: A Predictive Approach To Enhance Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15217v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time-series forecasting is essential across a multitude of scientific and industrial domains, yet deep learning models often struggle with challenges such as capturing long-term dependencies and adapting to drift in data distributions over time. We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our approach involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on present data. When discrepancies arise between the forecasting and detection models, the forecasting model undergoes more substantial updates, effectively minimizing surprise and adapting to shifts in the data distribution by aligning its predictions with actual future outcomes. This feedback loop, drawing upon principles of predictive coding, enables the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters, improving accuracy by focusing on features that remain relevant despite changes in the underlying data. We validate our method on a variety of tasks such as seizure prediction in biomedical signal analysis and forecasting in dynamical systems, achieving a 40\% increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and a 10\% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE), respectively. By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism that adapts to data distribution drift, Future-Guided Learning offers a promising avenue for advancing time-series forecasting with deep learning.</p></details> |  |

To address this, hyperspectral data from specialized cameras can be very useful in addition to RGB images. However, due to hardware constraints, high spectral data often come with lower spatial resolution. Additionally, incorporating such data into a learning-based segmentation framework is challenging due to the numerous data channels involved. To overcome these difficulties, we propose an innovative Siamese framework that uses time series-based compression to effectively and scalably integrate the additional spectral data into the segmentation task. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness through competitive benchmarks on aerial datasets in various environmental conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP) 2024.

| **[Incorporating Metabolic Information into LLMs for Anomaly Detection in Clinical Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12830v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in clinical time-series holds significant potential in identifying suspicious patterns in different biological parameters. In this paper, we propose a targeted method that incorporates the clinical domain knowledge into LLMs to improve their ability to detect anomalies. We introduce the Metabolism Pathway-driven Prompting (MPP) method, which integrates the information about metabolic pathways to better capture the structural and temporal changes in biological samples. We applied our method for doping detection in sports, focusing on steroid metabolism, and evaluated using real-world data from athletes. The results show that our method improves anomaly detection performance by leveraging metabolic context, providing a more nuanced and accurate prediction of suspicious samples in athletes' profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Networks with LSTM and GRU in Modeling Active Fires in the Amazon](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02681v5)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a comprehensive methodology for modeling and forecasting the historical time series of active fire spots detected by the AQUA\_M-T satellite in the Amazon, Brazil. The approach employs a mixed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to predict the monthly accumulations of daily detected active fire spots. Data analysis revealed a consistent seasonality over time, with annual maximum and minimum values tending to repeat at the same periods each year. The primary objective is to verify whether the forecasts capture this inherent seasonality through machine learning techniques. The methodology involved careful data preparation, model configuration, and training using cross-validation with two seeds, ensuring that the data generalizes well to both the test and validation sets for both seeds. The results indicate that the combined LSTM and GRU model delivers excellent forecasting performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal patterns and modeling the observed time series. This research significantly contributes to the application of deep learning techniques in environmental monitoring, specifically in forecasting active fire spots. The proposed approach highlights the potential for adaptation to other time series forecasting challenges, opening new opportunities for research and development in machine learning and prediction of natural phenomena.

| **[Collaborative State Fusion in Partially Known Multi-agent Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15137v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the collaborative state fusion problem in a multi-agent environment, where mobile agents collaborate to track movable targets. Due to the limited sensing range and potential errors of on-board sensors, it is necessary to aggregate individual observations to provide target state fusion for better target state estimation. Existing schemes do not perform well due to (1) impractical assumption of the fully known prior target state-space model and (2) observation outliers from individual sensors. To address the issues, we propose a two-stage collaborative fusion framework, namely \underline{L}earnable Weighted R\underline{o}bust \underline{F}usion (\textsf{LoF}). \textsf{LoF} combines a local state estimator (e.g., Kalman Filter) with a learnable weight generator to address the mismatch between the prior state-space model and underlying patterns of moving targets. Moreover, given observation outliers, we develop a time-series soft medoid(TSM) scheme to perform robust fusion. We evaluate \textsf{LoF} in a collaborative detection simulation environment with promising results. In an example setting with 4 agents and 2 targets, \textsf{LoF} leads to a 9.1\% higher fusion gain compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Unexpected increases in passengers can cause overcrowded vehicles, longer boarding times, and service disruptions. Traditional time series models like ARIMA and SARIMA face limitations, particularly in short-term predictions and integration of spatial and temporal features. These models struggle with the dynamic nature of ridership patterns and often ignore spatial correlations between nearby stops. Deep Learning (DL) models present a promising alternative, demonstrating superior performance in short-term prediction tasks by effectively capturing both spatial and temporal features. However, challenges such as dynamic spatial feature extraction, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency, and ensuring scalability remain. This paper introduces DST-TransitNet, a hybrid DL model for system-wide station-level ridership prediction. This proposed model uses graph neural networks (GNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to dynamically integrate the changing temporal and spatial correlations within the stations. The model also employs a precise time series decomposition framework to enhance accuracy and interpretability. Tested on Bogota's BRT system data, with three distinct social scenarios, DST-TransitNet outperformed state-of-the-art models in precision, efficiency and robustness. Meanwhile, it maintains stability over long prediction intervals, demonstrating practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 22 figures.

Existing methods for MedTS classification primarily rely on handcrafted biomarkers extraction and CNN-based models, with limited exploration of transformer-based models. In this paper, we introduce Medformer, a multi-granularity patching transformer tailored specifically for MedTS classification. Our method incorporates three novel mechanisms to leverage the unique characteristics of MedTS: cross-channel patching to leverage inter-channel correlations, multi-granularity embedding for capturing features at different scales, and two-stage (intra- and inter-granularity) multi-granularity self-attention for learning features and correlations within and among granularities. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets under both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent setups. Results demonstrate Medformer's superiority over 10 baselines, achieving top averaged ranking across five datasets on all six evaluation metrics. These findings underscore the significant impact of our method on healthcare applications, such as diagnosing Myocardial Infarction, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.

| **[HiPPO-KAN: Efficient KAN Model for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14939v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we introduces a parameter-efficient model that outperforms traditional models in time series forecasting, by integrating High-order Polynomial Projection (HiPPO) theory into the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) framework. This HiPPO-KAN model achieves superior performance on long sequence data without increasing parameter count. Experimental results demonstrate that HiPPO-KAN maintains a constant parameter count while varying window sizes and prediction horizons, in contrast to KAN, whose parameter count increases linearly with window size. Surprisingly, although the HiPPO-KAN model keeps a constant parameter count as increasing window size, it significantly outperforms KAN model at larger window sizes. These results indicate that HiPPO-KAN offers significant parameter efficiency and scalability advantages for time series forecasting. Additionally, we address the lagging problem commonly encountered in time series forecasting models, where predictions fail to promptly capture sudden changes in the data. We achieve this by modifying the loss function to compute the MSE directly on the coefficient vectors in the HiPPO domain. This adjustment effectively resolves the lagging problem, resulting in predictions that closely follow the actual time series data. By incorporating HiPPO theory into KAN, this study showcases an efficient approach for handling long sequences with improved predictive accuracy, offering practical contributions for applications in large-scale time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Koopman Learning with Episodic Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12615v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Koopman operator theory has found significant success in learning models of complex, real-world dynamical systems, enabling prediction and control. The greater interpretability and lower computational costs of these models, compared to traditional machine learning methodologies, make Koopman learning an especially appealing approach. Despite this, little work has been performed on endowing Koopman learning with the ability to leverage its own failures. To address this, we equip Koopman methods - developed for predicting non-autonomous time-series - with an episodic memory mechanism, enabling global recall of (or attention to) periods in time where similar dynamics previously occurred. We find that a basic implementation of Koopman learning with episodic memory leads to significant improvements in prediction on synthetic and real-world data. Our framework has considerable potential for expansion, allowing for future advances, and opens exciting new directions for Koopman learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Better Batch for Deep Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17028v5)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep probabilistic time series forecasting has gained attention for its ability to provide nonlinear approximation and valuable uncertainty quantification for decision-making. However, existing models often oversimplify the problem by assuming a time-independent error process and overlooking serial correlation. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative training method that incorporates error autocorrelation to enhance probabilistic forecasting accuracy. Our method constructs a mini-batch as a collection of $D$ consecutive time series segments for model training. It explicitly learns a time-varying covariance matrix over each mini-batch, encoding error correlation among adjacent time steps. The learned covariance matrix can be used to improve prediction accuracy and enhance uncertainty quantification. We evaluate our method on two different neural forecasting models and multiple public datasets. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving the performance of both models across a range of datasets, resulting in notable improvements in predictive accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 27th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2024); We corrected a misleading notation in the published version and added a link to the code</p></details> |

Despite the primary focus on NLP, we posit that the paradigm of retrieval-enhancement can be extended to a broader spectrum of machine learning (ML) such as computer vision, time series prediction, and computational biology. Therefore, this work introduces a formal framework of this paradigm, Retrieval-Enhanced Machine Learning (REML), by synthesizing the literature in various domains in ML with consistent notations which is missing from the current literature. Also, we found that while a number of studies employ retrieval components to augment their models, there is a lack of integration with foundational Information Retrieval (IR) research. We bridge this gap between the seminal IR research and contemporary REML studies by investigating each component that comprises the REML framework. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to equip researchers across various disciplines with a comprehensive, formally structured framework of retrieval-enhanced models, thereby fostering interdisciplinary future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Regularization of Learnable Embeddings for Time Series Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14630v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In processing multiple time series, accounting for the individual features of each sequence can be challenging. To address this, modern deep learning methods for time series analysis combine a shared (global) model with local layers, specific to each time series, often implemented as learnable embeddings. Ideally, these local embeddings should encode meaningful representations of the unique dynamics of each sequence. However, when these are learned end-to-end as parameters of a forecasting model, they may end up acting as mere sequence identifiers. Shared processing blocks may then become reliant on such identifiers, limiting their transferability to new contexts. In this paper, we address this issue by investigating methods to regularize the learning of local learnable embeddings for time series processing. Specifically, we perform the first extensive empirical study on the subject and show how such regularizations consistently improve performance in widely adopted architectures. Furthermore, we show that methods preventing the co-adaptation of local and global parameters are particularly effective in this context. This hypothesis is validated by comparing several methods preventing the downstream models from relying on sequence identifiers, going as far as completely resetting the embeddings during training. The obtained results provide an important contribution to understanding the interplay between learnable local parameters and shared processing layers: a key challenge in modern time series processing models and a step toward developing effective foundation models for time series.</p></details> |  |

However, it is unclear how these models will influence financial markets, especially when they infer financial value in a semi-autonomous way. In this work, we explore the interplay between deep generative models and market dynamics. We develop a form of virtual traders that use deep generative models to make buy/sell decisions, which we term neuro-symbolic traders, and expose them to a virtual market. Under our framework, neuro-symbolic traders are agents that use vision-language models to discover a model of the fundamental value of an asset. Agents develop this model as a stochastic differential equation, calibrated to market data using gradient descent. We test our neuro-symbolic traders on both synthetic data and real financial time series, including an equity stock, commodity, and a foreign exchange pair. We then expose several groups of neuro-symbolic traders to a virtual market environment. This market environment allows for feedback between the traders belief of the underlying value to the observed price dynamics. We find that this leads to price suppression compared to the historical data, highlighting a future risk to market stability. Our work is a first step towards quantifying the effect of deep generative agents on markets dynamics and sets out some of the potential risks and benefits of this approach in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, ACM format</p></details> |

This motivates the objective of discovering typical care pathways from patient data. Revealing typical care pathways can be achieved through clustering. The difficulty in clustering care pathways, represented by sequences of timestamped events, lies in defining a semantically appropriate metric and clustering algorithms. In this article, we adapt two methods developed for time series to the clustering of timed sequences: the drop-DTW metric and the DBA approach for the construction of averaged time sequences. These methods are then applied in clustering algorithms to propose original and sound clustering algorithms for timed sequences. This approach is experimented with and evaluated on synthetic and real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ANT: Adaptive Noise Schedule for Time Series Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14488v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in diffusion models for generative artificial intelligence have recently propagated to the time series (TS) domain, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, prior works on TS diffusion models often borrow the framework of existing works proposed in other domains without considering the characteristics of TS data, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose Adaptive Noise schedule for Time series diffusion models (ANT), which automatically predetermines proper noise schedules for given TS datasets based on their statistics representing non-stationarity. Our intuition is that an optimal noise schedule should satisfy the following desiderata: 1) It linearly reduces the non-stationarity of TS data so that all diffusion steps are equally meaningful, 2) the data is corrupted to the random noise at the final step, and 3) the number of steps is sufficiently large. The proposed method is practical for use in that it eliminates the necessity of finding the optimal noise schedule with a small additional cost to compute the statistics for given datasets, which can be done offline before training. We validate the effectiveness of our method across various tasks, including TS forecasting, refinement, and generation, on datasets from diverse domains.

| **[Predicting time-varying flux and balance in metabolic systems using structured neural-ODE processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14426v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a novel data-driven framework as an alternative to dynamic flux balance analysis, bypassing the demand for deep domain knowledge and manual efforts to formulate the optimization problem. The proposed framework is end-to-end, which trains a structured neural ODE process (SNODEP) model to estimate flux and balance samples using gene-expression time-series data. SNODEP is designed to circumvent the limitations of the standard neural ODE process model, including restricting the latent and decoder sampling distributions to be normal and lacking structure between context points for calculating the latent, thus more suitable for modeling the underlying dynamics of a metabolic system. Through comprehensive experiments ($156$ in total), we demonstrate that SNODEP not only predicts the unseen time points of real-world gene-expression data and the flux and balance estimates well but can even generalize to more challenging unseen knockout configurations and irregular data sampling scenarios, all essential for metabolic pathway analysis. We hope our work can serve as a catalyst for building more scalable and powerful models for genome-scale metabolic analysis.

Unlike common data analysis frameworks, it builds up from well defined and reusable logical units (objects), which can be easily combined together in order to ensure a high level of consistency. Thanks to this approach, Timeseria can address by design several non-trivial issues often underestimated, such as handling data losses, non-uniform sampling rates, differences between aggregated data and punctual observations, time zones, daylight saving times, and more. Timeseria comes with a comprehensive set of base data structures, common data manipulation operations, and extensible models for data reconstruction, forecasting and anomaly detection. It also integrates a powerful plotting engine capable of handling even millions of data points.</p></details> |  |

These methods are related to two main wavelet tools: the windowed scalogram difference and the scale index. The windowed scalogram difference compares two time series, identifying if their scalograms follow similar patterns at different scales and times, and it is thus a useful complement to other comparison tools such as the squared wavelet coherence. On the other hand, the scale index provides a numerical estimation of the degree of non-periodicity of a time series and it is widely used in many scientific areas.</p></details> | 27 pages, 17 figures |

One area that stands to benefit greatly is Earth observation, where these models can efficiently process large-scale, unlabeled geospatial data. In this work we extend the SwinMAE model to integrate temporal information for satellite time-series data. The architecture employs a hierarchical 3D Masked Autoencoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks to effectively capture multi-scale spatio-temporal dependencies in satellite imagery. To enhance transfer learning, we incorporate both encoder and decoder pretrained weights, along with skip connections to preserve scale-specific information. This forms an architecture similar to SwinUNet with an additional temporal component. Our approach shows significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art foundation models for all the evaluated downstream tasks: land cover segmentation, building density prediction, flood mapping, wildfire scar mapping and multi-temporal crop segmentation. Particularly, in the land cover segmentation task of the PhilEO Bench dataset, it outperforms other geospatial foundation models with a 10.4% higher accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[On time series clustering with k-means](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14269v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a long history of research into time series clustering using distance-based partitional clustering. Many of the most popular algorithms adapt k-means (also known as Lloyd's algorithm) to exploit time dependencies in the data by specifying a time series distance function. However, these algorithms are often presented with k-means configured in various ways, altering key parameters such as the initialisation strategy. This variability makes it difficult to compare studies because k-means is known to be highly sensitive to its configuration. To address this, we propose a standard Lloyd's-based model for TSCL that adopts an end-to-end approach, incorporating a specialised distance function not only in the assignment step but also in the initialisation and stopping criteria. By doing so, we create a unified structure for comparing seven popular Lloyd's-based TSCL algorithms. This common framework enables us to more easily attribute differences in clustering performance to the distance function itself, rather than variations in the k-means configuration.</p></details> |  |

It can provide deep insights into the behavior of systems evolving in time, as typically described by differential or recursive equations. A common approach to facilitate mathematical tractability and interpretability of DS models involves decomposing nonlinear DS into multiple linear DS separated by switching manifolds, i.e. piecewise linear (PWL) systems. PWL models are popular in engineering and a frequent choice in mathematics for analyzing the topological properties of DS. However, hand-crafting such models is tedious and only possible for very low-dimensional scenarios, while inferring them from data usually gives rise to unnecessarily complex representations with very many linear subregions. Here we introduce Almost-Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs) which automatically and robustly produce most parsimonious PWL representations of DS from time series data, using as few PWL nonlinearities as possible. AL-RNNs can be efficiently trained with any SOTA algorithm for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR), and naturally give rise to a symbolic encoding of the underlying DS that provably preserves important topological properties. We show that for the Lorenz and R\"ossler systems, AL-RNNs discover, in a purely data-driven way, the known topologically minimal PWL representations of the corresponding chaotic attractors. We further illustrate on two challenging empirical datasets that interpretable symbolic encodings of the dynamics can be achieved, tremendously facilitating mathematical and computational analysis of the underlying systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Granger Causality in Extremes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09632v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a rigorous mathematical framework for Granger causality in extremes, designed to identify causal links from extreme events in time series. Granger causality plays a pivotal role in uncovering directional relationships among time-varying variables. While this notion gains heightened importance during extreme and highly volatile periods, state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on causality within the body of the distribution, often overlooking causal mechanisms that manifest only during extreme events. Our framework is designed to infer causality mainly from extreme events by leveraging the causal tail coefficient. We establish equivalences between causality in extremes and other causal concepts, including (classical) Granger causality, Sims causality, and structural causality. We prove other key properties of Granger causality in extremes and show that the framework is especially helpful under the presence of hidden confounders. We also propose a novel inference method for detecting the presence of Granger causality in extremes from data. Our method is model-free, can handle non-linear and high-dimensional time series, outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in all considered setups, both in performance and speed, and was found to uncover coherent effects when applied to financial and extreme weather observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timer: Generative Pre-trained Transformers Are Large Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02368v3)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has contributed remarkably to the advancement of time series analysis. Still, deep models can encounter performance bottlenecks in real-world data-scarce scenarios, which can be concealed due to the performance saturation with small models on current benchmarks. Meanwhile, large models have demonstrated great powers in these scenarios through large-scale pre-training. Continuous progress has been achieved with the emergence of large language models, exhibiting unprecedented abilities such as few-shot generalization, scalability, and task generality, which are however absent in small deep models. To change the status quo of training scenario-specific small models from scratch, this paper aims at the early development of large time series models (LTSM). During pre-training, we curate large-scale datasets with up to 1 billion time points, unify heterogeneous time series into single-series sequence (S3) format, and develop the GPT-style architecture toward LTSMs. To meet diverse application needs, we convert forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection of time series into a unified generative task. The outcome of this study is a Time Series Transformer (Timer), which is generative pre-trained by next token prediction and adapted to various downstream tasks with promising capabilities as an LTSM.

| **[Hierarchical Conditional Multi-Task Learning for Streamflow Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14137v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Streamflow, vital for water resource management, is governed by complex hydrological systems involving intermediate processes driven by meteorological forces. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results of streamflow prediction, their end-to-end single-task learning approach often fails to capture the causal relationships within these systems. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Conditional Multi-Task Learning (HCMTL), a hierarchical approach that jointly models soil water and snowpack processes based on their causal connections to streamflow. HCMTL utilizes task embeddings to connect network modules, enhancing flexibility and expressiveness while capturing unobserved processes beyond soil water and snowpack. It also incorporates the Conditional Mini-Batch strategy to improve long time series modeling. We compare HCMTL with five baselines on a global dataset. HCMTL's superior performance across hundreds of drainage basins over extended periods shows that integrating domain-specific causal knowledge into deep learning enhances both prediction accuracy and interpretability. This is essential for advancing our understanding of complex hydrological systems and supporting efficient water resource management to mitigate natural disasters like droughts and floods.</p></details> |  |

These capabilities can be partly explained if LLMs understand basic time series concepts. However, our knowledge of what these models understand about time series data remains relatively limited. To address this gap, we introduce TimeSeriesExam, a configurable and scalable multiple-choice question exam designed to assess LLMs across five core time series understanding categories: pattern recognition, noise understanding, similarity analysis, anomaly detection, and causality analysis. TimeSeriesExam comprises of over 700 questions, procedurally generated using 104 carefully curated templates and iteratively refined to balance difficulty and their ability to discriminate good from bad models. We test 7 state-of-the-art LLMs on the TimeSeriesExam and provide the first comprehensive evaluation of their time series understanding abilities. Our results suggest that closed-source models such as GPT-4 and Gemini understand simple time series concepts significantly better than their open-source counterparts, while all models struggle with complex concepts such as causality analysis. We believe that the ability to programatically generate questions is fundamental to assessing and improving LLM's ability to understand and reason about time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS'24 Time Series in the Age of Large Models Workshop</p></details> |

Transformers are a relatively new deep learning architecture, which has served as the foundation for groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT. While TL has been studied in the past, these studies considered either one TL strategy or used older deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks. Here, we carry out an extensive empirical study on six different TL strategies and analyse their performance under varying feature spaces. In addition to the vanilla Transformer architecture, we also experiment with Informer and PatchTST, specifically designed for time series forecasting. We use 16 datasets from the Building Data Genome Project 2 to create building energy consumption forecasting models. Experiment results reveal that while TL is generally beneficial, especially when the target domain has no data, careful selection of the exact TL strategy should be made to gain the maximum benefit. This decision largely depends on the feature space properties such as the recorded weather features. We also note that PatchTST outperforms the other two Transformer variants (vanilla Transformer and Informer). We believe our findings would assist researchers in making informed decision in using TL and transformer architectures for building energy consumption forecasting.</p></details> |  |

While generative models have shown great promise in capturing the intricate dynamics inherent in time series, evaluating their performance remains a major challenge. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short due to the temporal dependencies and potential high dimensionality of the features. In this paper, we propose the REcurrent NeurAL (RENAL) Goodness-of-Fit test, a novel and statistically rigorous framework for evaluating generative time series models. By leveraging recurrent neural networks, we transform the time series into conditionally independent data pairs, enabling the application of a chi-square-based goodness-of-fit test to the temporal dependencies within the data. This approach offers a robust, theoretically grounded solution for assessing the quality of generative models, particularly in settings with limited time sequences. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy. Our method fills a critical gap in the evaluation of time series generative models, offering a tool that is both practical and adaptable to high-stakes applications.</p></details> | 27 pages, 4 figures |

By reviewing existing studies, it is clear that there are several gaps in the field to ensure reliable islanding detection, including (i) model complexity and stability concerns, (ii) limited accuracy under noisy conditions, and (iii) limited applicability to systems with different types of resources. Accordingly, this paper proposes a WaveNet classifier reinforced by a denoising U-Net model to address these shortcomings. The proposed scheme has a simple structure due to the use of 1D convolutional layers and incorporates residual connections that significantly enhance the model's generalization. Additionally, the proposed scheme is robust against noisy conditions by incorporating a denoising U-Net model. Furthermore, the model is sufficiently fast using a sliding window time series of 10 milliseconds for detection. Utilizing positive/negative/zero sequence components of voltages, superimposed waveforms, and the rate of change of frequency provides the necessary features to precisely detect the islanding condition. In order to assess the effectiveness of the suggested scheme, over 3k islanding/non-islanding cases were tested, considering different load active/reactive powers values, load switching transients, capacitor bank switching, fault conditions in the main grid, different load quality factors, signal-to-noise ratio levels, and both types of conventional and inverter-based sources.</p></details> |  |

However, despite ongoing research efforts to better understand these models, the field still lacks a comprehensive understanding. This is particularly true for deep time series forecasting methods, where analysis and understanding work is relatively limited. Time series data, unlike image and text information, can be more challenging to interpret and analyze. To address this, we approach the problem from a manifold learning perspective, assuming that the latent representations of time series forecasting models lie next to a low-dimensional manifold. In our study, we focus on analyzing the geometric features of these latent data manifolds, including intrinsic dimension and principal curvatures. Our findings reveal that deep transformer models exhibit similar geometric behavior across layers, and these geometric features are correlated with model performance. Additionally, we observe that untrained models initially have different structures, but they rapidly converge during training. By leveraging our geometric analysis and differentiable tools, we can potentially design new and improved deep forecasting neural networks. This approach complements existing analysis studies and contributes to a better understanding of transformer models in the context of time series forecasting.

Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p></details> |  |

Recently, topological data analysis (TDA) methods have been applied to study this time series representation mainly through the lens of persistent homology. Current literature on the fusion of TDE and TDA are adept at analyzing uniformly-spaced time series observations. This work introduces a novel {\em subsequence} embedding method for irregularly-spaced time-series data. We show that this method preserves the original state space topology while reducing spurious homological features. Theoretical stability results and convergence properties of the proposed method in the presence of noise and varying levels of irregularity in the spacing of the time series are established. Numerical studies and an application to real data illustrates the performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

The curation of such datasets is both time consuming and prone to systematic biases, which result in difficulties with cross-dataset generalization, hindering general applicability. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised method for earthquake detection that learns to detect earthquakes from raw waveforms, without access to ground truth labels. The performance is comparable to, and in some cases better than, some state-of-the-art supervised methods. Moreover, the method has strong \emph{cross-dataset generalization} performance. The algorithm utilizes deep autoencoders that learn to reproduce the waveforms after a data-compressive bottleneck and uses a simple, cross-covariance-based triggering algorithm at the bottleneck for labeling. The approach has the potential to be useful for time series datasets from other domains.</p></details> |  |

Due to the diversity and complexity of the world economy, a wide range of models have been used, but there are challenges in making decadal GDP forecasts given unexpected changes such as emergence of catastrophic world events including pandemics and wars. Deep learning models are well suited for modelling temporal sequences and time series forecasting. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to forecast the GDP growth rate of the world economy over a decade. We use the Penn World Table as the data source featuring 13 countries prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as Australia, China, India, and the United States. We present a recursive deep learning framework to predict the GDP growth rate in the next ten years. We test prominent deep learning models and compare their results with traditional econometric models for selected developed and developing countries. Our decadal forecasts reveal that that most of the developed countries would experience economic growth slowdown, stagnation and even recession within five years (2020-2024). Furthermore, our model forecasts show that only China, France, and India would experience stable GDP growth.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArrivalNet: Predicting City-wide Bus/Tram Arrival Time with Two-dimensional Temporal Variation Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14742v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate arrival time prediction (ATP) of buses and trams plays a crucial role in public transport operations. Current methods focused on modeling one-dimensional temporal information but overlooked the latent periodic information within time series. Moreover, most studies developed algorithms for ATP based on a single or a few routes of public transport, which reduces the transferability of the prediction models and their applicability in public transport management systems. To this end, this paper proposes \textit{ArrivalNet}, a two-dimensional temporal variation-based multi-step ATP for buses and trams. It decomposes the one-dimensional temporal sequence into intra-periodic and inter-periodic variations, which can be recast into two-dimensional tensors (2D blocks). Each row of a tensor contains the time points within a period, and each column involves the time points at the same intra-periodic index across various periods. The transformed 2D blocks in different frequencies have an image-like feature representation that enables effective learning with computer vision backbones (e.g., convolutional neural network). Drawing on the concept of residual neural network, the 2D block module is designed as a basic module for flexible aggregation. Meanwhile, contextual factors like workdays, peak hours, and intersections, are also utilized in the augmented feature representation to improve the performance of prediction. 125 days of public transport data from Dresden were collected for model training and validation. Experimental results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of the proposed predictor decrease by at least 6.1\%, 14.7\%, and 34.2\% compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE T-ITS</p></details> |

Neurodegeneration is studied widely as a biomarker for clinical diagnosis, which can be measured from time series MRI progression. On the other hand, generative AI has shown promise in anomaly detection in medical imaging and used for tasks including tumor detection. However, testing the reliability of such data-driven methods is non-trivial due to the issue of double-dipping in hypothesis testing. In this work, we propose to solve this issue with selective inference and develop a reliable generative AI method for Alzheimer's prediction. We show that compared to traditional statistical methods with highly inflated p-values, selective inference successfully controls the false discovery rate under the desired alpha level while retaining statistical power. In practice, our pipeline could assist clinicians in Alzheimer's diagnosis and early intervention.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)~\textit{~The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple datasets, different missing scenarios and missing ratios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[FDF: Flexible Decoupled Framework for Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Denoising and Polynomial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13253v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is vital in numerous web applications, influencing critical decision-making across industries. While diffusion models have recently gained increasing popularity for this task, we argue they suffer from a significant drawback: indiscriminate noise addition to the original time series followed by denoising, which can obscure underlying dynamic evolving trend and complicate forecasting. To address this limitation, we propose a novel flexible decoupled framework (FDF) that learns high-quality time series representations for enhanced forecasting performance. A key characteristic of our approach leverages the inherent inductive bias of time series data by decomposing it into trend and seasonal components, each modeled separately to enable decoupled analysis and modeling. Specifically, we propose an innovative Conditional Denoising Seasonal Module (CDSM) within the diffusion model, which leverages statistical information from the historical window to conditionally model the complex seasonal component. Notably, we incorporate a Polynomial Trend Module (PTM) to effectively capture the smooth trend component, thereby enhancing the model's ability to represent temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and higlighting its flexibility in time series forecasting. We hope our work can bring a new perspective for time series forecasting. We intend to make our code publicly available as open-source in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context Matters: Leveraging Contextual Features for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12672v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasts are often influenced by exogenous contextual features in addition to their corresponding history. For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</p></details> |  |

However, we often observe inconsistent or seemingly contradictory performance findings across different studies. This hinders our understanding of the merits of different approaches and slows down progress. We address the need for means of assessing MTS forecasting proposals reliably and fairly, in turn enabling better exploitation of MTS as seen in different applications. Specifically, we first propose BasicTS+, a benchmark designed to enable fair, comprehensive, and reproducible comparison of MTS forecasting solutions. BasicTS+ establishes a unified training pipeline and reasonable settings, enabling an unbiased evaluation. Second, we identify the heterogeneity across different MTS as an important consideration and enable classification of MTS based on their temporal and spatial characteristics. Disregarding this heterogeneity is a prime reason for difficulties in selecting the most promising technical directions. Third, we apply BasicTS+ along with rich datasets to assess the capabilities of more than 45 MTS forecasting solutions. This provides readers with an overall picture of the cutting-edge research on MTS forecasting.

However, their internal representations and learned concepts are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the structure and redundancy of representations across various TSFMs, examining the self-similarity of model layers within and across different model sizes. This analysis reveals block-like redundancy in the representations, which can be utilized for informed pruning to improve inference speed and efficiency. Additionally, we explore the concepts learned by these models - such as periodicity and trends - and how these can be manipulated through latent space steering to influence model behavior. Our experiments show that steering interventions can introduce new features, e.g., adding periodicity or trends to signals that initially lacked them. These findings underscore the value of representational analysis for optimizing models and demonstrate how conceptual steering offers new possibilities for more controlled and efficient time series analysis with TSFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSET: Swapping-Sliding Explanation for Time Series Classifiers in Affect Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12996v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local explanation of machine learning (ML) models has recently received significant attention due to its ability to reduce ambiguities about why the models make specific decisions. Extensive efforts have been invested to address explainability for different data types, particularly images. However, the work on multivariate time series data is limited. A possible reason is that the conflation of time and other variables in time series data can cause the generated explanations to be incomprehensible to humans. In addition, some efforts on time series fall short of providing accurate explanations as they either ignore a context in the time domain or impose differentiability requirements on the ML models. Such restrictions impede their ability to provide valid explanations in real-world applications and non-differentiable ML settings. In this paper, we propose a swapping--sliding decision explanation for multivariate time series classifiers, called SSET. The proposal consists of swapping and sliding stages, by which salient sub-sequences causing significant drops in the prediction score are presented as explanations. In the former stage, the important variables are detected by swapping the series of interest with close train data from target classes. In the latter stage, the salient observations of these variables are explored by sliding a window over each time step. Additionally, the model measures the importance of different variables over time in a novel way characterized by multiple factors. We leverage SSET on affect detection domain where evaluations are performed on two real-world physiological time series datasets, WESAD and MAHNOB-HCI, and a deep convolutional classifier, CN-Waterfall. This classifier has shown superior performance to prior models to detect human affective states. Comparing SSET with several benchmarks, including LIME, integrated gradients, and Dynamask, we found..</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Posterior Sampling: Time Series Generation with Hard Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12652v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints (~100) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 10% and 42%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.</p></details> |  |

Finding an optimal energy-efficient policy that is adaptable to underlying edge devices while meeting deadlines for tasks has always been challenging. This research studies generalized systems with multi-task, multi-deadline scenarios with reinforcement learning-based DVFS for energy saving. This work addresses the limitation of previous work that models a periodic system as a single task and single-deadline scenario, which is too simplified to cope with complex situations. The method encodes time series information in the Linux kernel into information that is easy to use for reinforcement learning, allowing the system to generate DVFS policies to adapt system patterns based on the general workload. For encoding, we present two different methods for comparison. Both methods use only one performance counter: system utilization and the kernel only needs minimal information from the userspace. Our method is implemented on Jetson Nano Board (2GB) and is tested with three fixed multitask workloads, which are three, five, and eight tasks in the workload, respectively. For randomness and generalization, we also designed a random workload generator to build different multitask workloads to test. Based on the test results, our method could save 3%-10% power compared to Linux built-in governors.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches used by practitioners are often ad-hoc and lack the abstractions needed to scale this process. We present TorchQL, a programming framework to evaluate and improve the correctness of machine learning applications. TorchQL allows users to write queries to specify and check integrity constraints over machine learning models and datasets. It seamlessly integrates relational algebra with functional programming to allow for highly expressive queries using only eight intuitive operators. We evaluate TorchQL on diverse use-cases including finding critical temporal inconsistencies in objects detected across video frames in autonomous driving, finding data imputation errors in time-series medical records, finding data labeling errors in real-world images, and evaluating biases and constraining outputs of language models. Our experiments show that TorchQL enables up to 13x faster query executions than baselines like Pandas and MongoDB, and up to 40% shorter queries than native Python. We also conduct a user study and find that TorchQL is natural enough for developers familiar with Python to specify complex integrity constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parsimony or Capability? Decomposition Delivers Both in Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11929v4)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) represents a critical frontier in time series analysis, characterized by extensive input sequences, as opposed to the shorter spans typical of traditional approaches. While longer sequences inherently offer richer information for enhanced predictive precision, prevailing studies often respond by escalating model complexity. These intricate models can inflate into millions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive parameter scales. Our study demonstrates, through both analytical and empirical evidence, that decomposition is key to containing excessive model inflation while achieving uniformly superior and robust results across various datasets. Remarkably, by tailoring decomposition to the intrinsic dynamics of time series data, our proposed model outperforms existing benchmarks, using over 99 \% fewer parameters than the majority of competing methods. Through this work, we aim to unleash the power of a restricted set of parameters by capitalizing on domain characteristics--a timely reminder that in the realm of LTSF, bigger is not invariably better.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Neural Scaling Laws for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12360v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisited Large Language Model for Time Series Analysis through Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12326v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive performance in many pivotal web applications such as sensor data analysis. However, since LLMs are not designed for time series tasks, simpler models like linear regressions can often achieve comparable performance with far less complexity. In this study, we perform extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of applying LLMs to key time series tasks, including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection. We compare the performance of LLMs against simpler baseline models, such as single-layer linear models and randomly initialized LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs offer minimal advantages for these core time series tasks and may even distort the temporal structure of the data. In contrast, simpler models consistently outperform LLMs while requiring far fewer parameters. Furthermore, we analyze existing reprogramming techniques and show, through data manifold analysis, that these methods fail to effectively align time series data with language and display pseudo-alignment behaviour in embedding space. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLM-based methods in time series tasks arises from the intrinsic characteristics and structure of time series data, rather than any meaningful alignment with the language model architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Leitmotifs in Multidimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12293v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A leitmotif is a recurring theme in literature, movies or music that carries symbolic significance for the piece it is contained in. When this piece can be represented as a multi-dimensional time series (MDTS), such as acoustic or visual observations, finding a leitmotif is equivalent to the pattern discovery problem, which is an unsupervised and complex problem in time series analytics. Compared to the univariate case, it carries additional complexity because patterns typically do not occur in all dimensions but only in a few - which are, however, unknown and must be detected by the method itself. In this paper, we present the novel, efficient and highly effective leitmotif discovery algorithm LAMA for MDTS. LAMA rests on two core principals: (a) a leitmotif manifests solely given a yet unknown number of sub-dimensions - neither too few, nor too many, and (b) the set of sub-dimensions are not independent from the best pattern found therein, necessitating both problems to be approached in a joint manner. In contrast to most previous methods, LAMA tackles both problems jointly - instead of independently selecting dimensions (or leitmotifs) and finding the best leitmotifs (or dimensions). Our experimental evaluation on a novel ground-truth annotated benchmark of 14 distinct real-life data sets shows that LAMA, when compared to four state-of-the-art baselines, shows superior performance in detecting meaningful patterns without increased computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning nomral patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising resutls, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Irregularity-Informed Time Series Analysis: Adaptive Modelling of Spatial and Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12257v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular Time Series Data (IRTS) has shown increasing prevalence in real-world applications. We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git</p></details> |  |
| **[FredNormer: Frequency Domain Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01860v4)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent normalization-based methods have shown great success in tackling the distribution shift issue, facilitating non-stationary time series forecasting. Since these methods operate in the time domain, they may fail to fully capture the dynamic patterns that are more apparent in the frequency domain, leading to suboptimal results. This paper first theoretically analyzes how normalization methods affect frequency components. We prove that the current normalization methods that operate in the time domain uniformly scale non-zero frequencies, and thus, they struggle to determine components that contribute to more robust forecasting. Therefore, we propose FredNormer, which observes datasets from a frequency perspective and adaptively up-weights the key frequency components. To this end, FredNormer consists of two components: a statistical metric that normalizes the input samples based on their frequency stability and a learnable weighting layer that adjusts stability and introduces sample-specific variations. Notably, FredNormer is a plug-and-play module, which does not compromise the efficiency compared to existing normalization methods. Extensive experiments show that FredNormer improves the averaged MSE of backbone forecasting models by 33.3% and 55.3% on the ETTm2 dataset. Compared to the baseline normalization methods, FredNormer achieves 18 top-1 results and 6 top-2 results out of 28 settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abnormality Forecasting: Time Series Anomaly Prediction via Future Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12206v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying anomalies from time series data plays an important role in various fields such as infrastructure security, intelligent operation and maintenance, and space exploration. Current research focuses on detecting the anomalies after they occur, which can lead to significant financial/reputation loss or infrastructure damage. In this work we instead study a more practical yet very challenging problem, time series anomaly prediction, aiming at providing early warnings for abnormal events before their occurrence. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel principled approach, namely future context modeling (FCM). Its key insight is that the future abnormal events in a target window can be accurately predicted if their preceding observation window exhibits any subtle difference to normal data. To effectively capture such differences, FCM first leverages long-term forecasting models to generate a discriminative future context based on the observation data, aiming to amplify those subtle but unusual difference. It then models a normality correlation of the observation data with the forecasting future context to complement the normality modeling of the observation data in foreseeing possible abnormality in the target window. A joint variate-time attention learning is also introduced in FCM to leverage both temporal signals and features of the time series data for more discriminative normality modeling in the aforementioned two views. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that FCM gains good recall rate (70\%+) on multiple datasets and significantly outperforms all baselines in F1 score.

In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for processing information, such as one-dimensional time series and two-dimensional images, in the frequency domain. The information of interest is encoded into the magnitude of probability amplitude or the coefficient of each basis state. The oracle for filtering operates based on postselection results, and its explicit circuit design is presented. This oracle is versatile enough to perform all basic filtering, including high pass, low pass, band pass, band stop, and many other processing techniques. Finally, we present two novel schemes for transposing matrices in this paper. They use similar encoding rules but with deliberate choices in terms of selecting basis states. These schemes could potentially be useful for other quantum information processing tasks, such as edge detection. The proposed techniques are implemented on the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. Some results are compared with traditional information processing results to verify their correctness and are presented in this paper.</p></details> | 12 pages, 53 figures |

Despite existing literature in this field, there is a lack of research on effectively integrating features from different periods, particularly intra-period and inter-period features, for subway station passenger flow prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel model called \textbf{M}uti \textbf{P}eriod \textbf{S}patial \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{MPSTN}) that leverages features from different periods by transforming one-dimensional time series data into two-dimensional matrices based on periods. The folded matrices exhibit structural characteristics similar to images, enabling the utilization of image processing techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to integrate features from different periods. Therefore, our MPSTN model incorporates a CNN module to extract temporal information from different periods and a graph neural network (GNN) module to integrate spatial information from different stations. We compared our approach with various state-of-the-art methods for spatiotemporal data prediction using a publicly available dataset and achieved minimal prediction errors.

Traditional time series approaches for prediction often focus on either autoregressive modeling, which relies solely on past observations of the target ``endogenous variables'', or forward modeling, which considers only current covariate drivers ``exogenous variables''. However, effectively integrating past endogenous and past exogenous with current exogenous variables remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ExoTST, a novel transformer-based framework that effectively incorporates current exogenous variables alongside past context for improved time series prediction. To integrate exogenous information efficiently, ExoTST leverages the strengths of attention mechanisms and introduces a novel cross-temporal modality fusion module. This module enables the model to jointly learn from both past and current exogenous series, treating them as distinct modalities. By considering these series separately, ExoTST provides robustness and flexibility in handling data uncertainties that arise from the inherent distribution shift between historical and current exogenous variables. Extensive experiments on real-world carbon flux datasets and time series benchmarks demonstrate ExoTST's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 10\% in prediction accuracy. Moreover, ExoTST exhibits strong robustness against missing values and noise in exogenous drivers, maintaining consistent performance in real-world situations where these imperfections are common.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDM 2024</p></details> |

Extending prior results, we sandwich the repetition time in terms of unconditional and conditional min-entropies. The condition for the upper bound resembles short memory in the sense developed in time series analysis. Our reasonings make a repeated use of dualities between so called times and so called counts that generalize the duality of the recurrence time and the longest match length. We also discuss the analogy of these results with the Wyner-Ziv/Ornstein-Weiss theorem, which sandwiches the recurrence time in terms of Shannon entropies.</p></details> | 22 pages |

However, the mechanisms by which LLMs use different parts of the input context remain largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of context utilization in MT, studying how LLMs use various context parts, such as few-shot examples and the source text, when generating translations. We highlight several key findings: (1) the source part of few-shot examples appears to contribute more than its corresponding targets, irrespective of translation direction; (2) finetuning LLMs with parallel data alters the contribution patterns of different context parts; and (3) there is a positional bias where earlier few-shot examples have higher contributions to the translated sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that inspecting anomalous context contributions can potentially uncover pathological translations, such as hallucinations. Our findings shed light on the internal workings of LLM-based MT which go beyond those known for standard encoder-decoder MT models.</p></details> |  |

Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by $1.9\sim3.9\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 110ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens.

| **[Pangea: A Fully Open Multilingual Multimodal LLM for 39 Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16153v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their development has predominantly focused on English- and western-centric datasets and tasks, leaving most of the world's languages and diverse cultural contexts underrepresented. This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we introduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance. We fully open-source our data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.</p></details> | 52 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Mechanism Design for LLM Fine-tuning with Multiple Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16276v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to aggregate multiple preferences has attracted considerable research attention. With aggregation algorithms advancing, a potential economic scenario arises where fine-tuning services are provided to agents with different preferences. In this context, agents may benefit from strategically misreporting their preferences, which could affect the fine-tuned outcomes. This paper addresses such incentive issues by framing it as a mechanism design problem: an LLM provider determines the fine-tuning objective (training rule) and the pricing scheme (payment rule) for agents. We primarily focus on a representative class of training rules that maximize social welfare subject to certain regularizations, referred to as \tr\ rules. Firstly, we show that under most circumstances, truthful reporting is sub-optimal with simply a training rule, thereby highlighting the necessity of payments. Secondly, we design affine maximizer payment rules that implement \tr\ rules in dominant-strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). We characterize sufficient conditions for payment equivalence properties. For a training rule that satisfies these conditions, we have found all the payment rules that implement it in DSIC, as they only differ by a constant term irrelevant to agents' reports from each other. Thirdly, we demonstrate that our mechanism is approximately DSIC even with perturbed input, showcasing its robustness against the inevitable errors in real-world applications. Experiments on real LLM setups further confirm the practical implications of our results.</p></details> | 35 pages, 2 figures |

Variation in grammatical and rhetorical styles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16107v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are capable of writing grammatical text that follows instructions, answers questions, and solves problems. As they have advanced, it has become difficult to distinguish their output from human-written text. While past research has found some differences in surface features such as word choice and punctuation, and developed classifiers to detect LLM output, none has studied the rhetorical styles of LLMs. Using several variants of Llama 3 and GPT-4o, we construct two parallel corpora of human- and LLM-written texts from common prompts. Using Douglas Biber's set of lexical, grammatical, and rhetorical features, we identify systematic differences between LLMs and humans and between different LLMs. These differences persist when moving from smaller models to larger ones, and are larger for instruction-tuned models than base models. This demonstrates that despite their advanced abilities, LLMs struggle to match human styles, and hence more advanced linguistic features can detect patterns in their behavior not previously recognized.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 4 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

While LLMs have shown high performance on idiomaticity detection tasks, this success may be attributed to reasoning shortcuts in existing datasets. To this end, we construct a novel, controlled contrastive dataset designed to test whether LLMs can effectively use context to disambiguate idiomatic meaning. Additionally, we explore how collocational frequency and sentence probability influence model performance. Our findings reveal that LLMs often fail to resolve idiomaticity when it is required to attend to the surrounding context, and that models perform better on sentences that have higher likelihood. The collocational frequency of expressions also impacts performance. We make our code and dataset publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural GaLore: Accelerating GaLore for memory-efficient LLM Training and Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16029v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training LLMs presents significant memory challenges due to growing size of data, weights, and optimizer states. Techniques such as data and model parallelism, gradient checkpointing, and offloading strategies address this issue but are often infeasible due to hardware constraints. To mitigate memory usage, alternative methods like Parameter-Efficient-Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and GaLore approximate weights or optimizer states. PEFT methods, such as LoRA, have gained popularity for fine-tuning LLMs, though they require a full-rank warm start. In contrast, GaLore allows full-parameter learning while being more memory-efficient. This work introduces Natural GaLore, a simple drop in replacement for AdamW, which efficiently applies the inverse Empirical Fisher Information Matrix to low-rank gradients using Woodbury's Identity. We demonstrate that incorporating second-order information speeds up optimization significantly, especially when the iteration budget is limited. Empirical pretraining on 60M, 130M, 350M, and 1.1B parameter Llama models on C4 data demonstrate significantly lower perplexity over GaLore without additional memory overhead. By fine-tuning RoBERTa on the GLUE benchmark using Natural GaLore, we demonstrate significant reduction in gap 86.05% vs 86.28% for full-finetuning. Furthermore, fine-tuning the TinyLlama 1.1B model for function calling using the TinyAgent framework shows that Natural GaLore achieving 83.09% accuracy on the TinyAgent dataset, significantly outperforms 16-bit LoRA at 80.06% and even surpasses GPT4-Turbo by 4%, all while using 30% less memory.

| **[Beware of Words: Evaluating the Lexical Diversity of Conversational LLMs using ChatGPT as Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15518v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs) in general, and of ChatGPT in particular, is currently being evaluated on many different tasks, from logical reasoning or maths to answering questions on a myriad of topics. Instead, much less attention is being devoted to the study of the linguistic features of the texts generated by these LLMs. This is surprising since LLMs are models for language, and understanding how they use the language is important. Indeed, conversational LLMs are poised to have a significant impact on the evolution of languages as they may eventually dominate the creation of new text. This means that for example, if conversational LLMs do not use a word it may become less and less frequent and eventually stop being used altogether. Therefore, evaluating the linguistic features of the text they produce and how those depend on the model parameters is the first step toward understanding the potential impact of conversational LLMs on the evolution of languages. In this paper, we consider the evaluation of the lexical richness of the text generated by LLMs and how it depends on the model parameters. A methodology is presented and used to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of lexical richness using ChatGPT as a case study. The results show how lexical richness depends on the version of ChatGPT and some of its parameters, such as the presence penalty, or on the role assigned to the model. The dataset and tools used in our analysis are released under open licenses with the goal of drawing the much-needed attention to the evaluation of the linguistic features of LLM-generated text.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Knowledge Selection Behaviours in LLMs via SAE-Based Representation Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15999v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can store a significant amount of factual knowledge in their parameters. However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context -- this phenomenon, known as \emph{context-memory knowledge conflicts}, can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. Analysing the internal activations of LLMs, we find that they can internally register the signals of knowledge conflict at mid-layers. Such signals allow us to detect whether a knowledge conflict occurs and use \emph{inference-time} intervention strategies to resolve it. In this work, we propose \textsc{SpARE}, a \emph{training-free} representation engineering method that uses pre-trained sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) to control the knowledge selection behaviour of LLMs. \textsc{SpARE} identifies the functional features that control the knowledge selection behaviours and applies them to edit the internal activations of LLMs at inference time. Our experimental results show that \textsc{SpARE} can effectively control the usage of either knowledge source to resolve knowledge conflict in open-domain question-answering tasks, surpassing existing representation engineering methods ($+10\%$) as well as contrastive decoding methods ($+15\%$).</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Language Models Have an English Accent? Evaluating and Improving the Naturalness of Multilingual LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15956v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly designed with English as the primary language, and even the few that are multilingual tend to exhibit strong English-centric biases. Much like speakers who might produce awkward expressions when learning a second language, LLMs often generate unnatural outputs in non-English languages, reflecting English-centric patterns in both vocabulary and grammar. Despite the importance of this issue, the naturalness of multilingual LLM outputs has received limited attention. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing novel automatic corpus-level metrics to assess the lexical and syntactic naturalness of LLM outputs in a multilingual context. Using our new metrics, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated benchmark in French and Chinese, revealing a tendency towards English-influenced patterns. To mitigate this issue, we also propose a simple and effective alignment method to improve the naturalness of an LLM in a target language and domain, achieving consistent improvements in naturalness without compromising the performance on general-purpose benchmarks. Our work highlights the importance of developing multilingual metrics, resources and methods for the new wave of multilingual LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The paper details the end-to-end pipeline, from data collection, preprocessing, to retrieval indexing and response generation, highlighting technical challenges and practical solutions. We aim to offer insights to researchers and practitioners developing similar systems using two distinct approaches: OpenAI's Assistant API with GPT Series and Llama's open-source models. The practical implications of this research lie in enhancing the reliability of generative AI systems in various sectors where domain-specific knowledge and real-time information retrieval is important.

These causal relationships are often represented by causal graphs, which are directed acyclic graphs. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an increasing interest in exploring their capabilities in causal reasoning and their potential use to hypothesize causal graphs. These tasks necessitate the LLMs to encode the causal graph effectively for subsequent downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, \emph{CausalGraph2LLM}, encompassing a variety of causal graph settings to assess the causal graph understanding capability of LLMs. We categorize the causal queries into two types: graph-level and node-level queries. We benchmark both open-sourced and closed models for our study. Our findings reveal that while LLMs show promise in this domain, they are highly sensitive to the encoding used. Even capable models like GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 exhibit sensitivity to encoding, with deviations of about $60\%$. We further demonstrate this sensitivity for downstream causal intervention tasks. Moreover, we observe that LLMs can often display biases when presented with contextual information about a causal graph, potentially stemming from their parametric memory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code - https://github.com/ivaxi0s/CausalGraph2LLM</p></details> |

Identifying text segments requiring fact-checking is known as claim detection (CD) and claim check-worthiness detection (CW), the latter incorporating complex domain-specific criteria of worthiness and often framed as a ranking task. Zero- and few-shot LLM prompting is an attractive option for both tasks, as it bypasses the need for labeled datasets and allows verbalized claim and worthiness criteria to be directly used for prompting. We evaluate the LLMs' predictive and calibration accuracy on five CD/CW datasets from diverse domains, each utilizing a different worthiness criterion. We investigate two key aspects: (1) how best to distill factuality and worthiness criteria into a prompt and (2) what amount of context to provide for each claim. To this end, we experiment with varying the level of prompt verbosity and the amount of contextual information provided to the model. Our results show that optimal prompt verbosity is domain-dependent, adding context does not improve performance, and confidence scores can be directly used to produce reliable check-worthiness rankings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WASSA at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

In this work, we conduct a theoretical analysis to better understand why No Position Encoding (NoPE) fails outside its effective range, as well as examining the power of Position Encoding (PE) in this context. Our findings reveal that with meticulous weave position, PE can indeed be extended beyond effective range. Our theorems establish that LLMs equipped with weave PE can achieve improved extrapolation performance without additional cost. Furthermore, we introduce a novel weave PE method, Mesa-Extrapolation, which utilizes a chunk-based triangular attention matrix and applies Stair PE to manage the final chunk. This method not only retains competitive performance but also offers substantial benefits such as significantly reduced memory demand and faster inference speed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Mesa-Extrapolation, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution to enhancing LLMs applicative reach.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) for GRN discovery, leveraging their learned biological knowledge alone or in combination with traditional statistical methods. We develop a task-based evaluation strategy to address the challenge of unavailable ground truth causal graphs. Specifically, we use the GRNs suggested by LLMs to guide causal synthetic data generation and compare the resulting data against the original dataset.

In particular, LLMs are capable of "lying", knowingly outputting false statements. Hence, it is of interest and importance to develop methods to detect when LLMs lie. Indeed, several authors trained classifiers to detect LLM lies based on their internal model activations. However, other researchers showed that these classifiers may fail to generalise, for example to negated statements. In this work, we aim to develop a robust method to detect when an LLM is lying. To this end, we make the following key contributions: (i) We demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional subspace, along which the activation vectors of true and false statements can be separated. Notably, this finding is universal and holds for various LLMs, including Gemma-7B, LLaMA2-13B, Mistral-7B and LLaMA3-8B. Our analysis explains the generalisation failures observed in previous studies and sets the stage for more robust lie detection; (ii) Building upon (i), we construct an accurate LLM lie detector. Empirically, our proposed classifier achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 94% accuracy in both distinguishing true from false factual statements and detecting lies generated in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 poster |

However, creating a powerful all-in-one LLM remains challenging due to the need for proprietary data and vast computational resources. As a resource-friendly alternative, we explore the potential of merging multiple expert models into a single LLM. Existing studies on model merging mainly focus on generalist LLMs instead of domain experts, or the LLMs under the same architecture and size. In this work, we propose an unconstrained model merging framework that accommodates both homogeneous and heterogeneous model architectures with a focus on reasoning tasks. A fine-grained layer-wise weight merging strategy is designed for homogeneous models merging, while heterogeneous model merging is built upon the probabilistic distribution knowledge derived from instruction-response fine-tuning data. Across 7 benchmarks and 9 reasoning-optimized LLMs, we reveal key findings that combinatorial reasoning emerges from merging which surpasses simple additive effects. We propose that unconstrained model merging could serve as a foundation for decentralized LLMs, marking a notable progression from the existing centralized LLM framework. This evolution could enhance wider participation and stimulate additional advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, effectively addressing the constraints posed by centralized models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, correct typos</p></details> |

However, In specialized fields such as patent, finance, or biomedical domains, terminology is crucial for translation, with many terms that needs to be translated following agreed-upon conventions. In this paper we introduce a methodology that efficiently trains models with a smaller amount of data while preserving the accuracy of terminology translation. We achieve this through a systematic process of term extraction and glossary creation using the Trie Tree algorithm, followed by data reconstruction to teach the LLM how to integrate these specialized terms. This methodology enhances the model's ability to handle specialized terminology and ensures high-quality translations, particularly in fields where term consistency is crucial. Our approach has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving the highest translation score among participants in the WMT patent task to date, showcasing its effectiveness and broad applicability in specialized translation domains where general methods often fall short.</p></details> | Accepted to WMT 2024 |

A Structured Investigation Framework and Toxicity Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06900v4)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the pursuit of developing Large Language Models (LLMs) that adhere to societal standards, it is imperative to detect the toxicity in the generated text. The majority of existing toxicity metrics rely on encoder models trained on specific toxicity datasets, which are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems and depend on the dataset's definition of toxicity. In this paper, we introduce a robust metric grounded on LLMs to flexibly measure toxicity according to the given definition. We first analyze the toxicity factors, followed by an examination of the intrinsic toxic attributes of LLMs to ascertain their suitability as evaluators. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our metric with detailed analysis. Our empirical results demonstrate outstanding performance in measuring toxicity within verified factors, improving on conventional metrics by 12 points in the F1 score. Our findings also indicate that upstream toxicity significantly influences downstream metrics, suggesting that LLMs are unsuitable for toxicity evaluations within unverified factors.</p></details> | 8 page long |

However, underrepresented languages like Cantonese, spoken by over 85 million people, face significant development gaps, which is particularly concerning given the economic significance of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, and in substantial Cantonese-speaking populations in places like Singapore and North America. Despite its wide use, Cantonese has scant representation in NLP research, especially compared to other languages from similarly developed regions. To bridge these gaps, we outline current Cantonese NLP methods and introduce new benchmarks designed to evaluate LLM performance in factual generation, mathematical logic, complex reasoning, and general knowledge in Cantonese, which aim to advance open-source Cantonese LLM technology. We also propose future research directions and recommended models to enhance Cantonese LLM development.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a simple but effective low-latency post-correction method, \textbf{Retrieval Augmented Correction (RAC)}, aimed at enhancing the factual performance of LLMs without requiring additional fine-tuning. Our method is general and can be used with any instruction-tuned LLM, and has greatly reduced latency compared to prior approaches. RAC decomposes the LLM's output into atomic facts and applies a fine-grained verification and correction process with retrieved content to verify and correct the LLM-generated output. Our extensive experiments show that RAC yields up to 30\% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across two popular factuality evaluation datasets, validating its efficacy and robustness in both with and without the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) across different LLMs.\footnote{Our code is at \url{https://github.com/jlab-nlp/Retrieval-Augmented-Correction}}</p></details> |  |

PCG has a long history in both the game industry and the academic world. It can increase player engagement and ease the work of game designers.

This survey explores the differences between various algorithms used for PCG, including search-based methods, machine learning-based methods, other frequently used methods (e.g., noise functions), and the newcomer, LLMs. We also provide a detailed discussion on combined methods. Furthermore, we compare these methods based on the type of content they generate and the publication dates of their respective papers. Finally, we identify gaps in the existing academic work and suggest possible directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMILES-Prompting: A Novel Approach to LLM Jailbreak Attacks in Chemical Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15641v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) across various fields has heightened concerns about their potential to propagate dangerous information. This paper specifically explores the security vulnerabilities of LLMs within the field of chemistry, particularly their capacity to provide instructions for synthesizing hazardous substances. We evaluate the effectiveness of several prompt injection attack methods, including red-teaming, explicit prompting, and implicit prompting. Additionally, we introduce a novel attack technique named SMILES-prompting, which uses the Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) to reference chemical substances. Our findings reveal that SMILES-prompting can effectively bypass current safety mechanisms. These findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced domain-specific safeguards in LLMs to prevent misuse and improve their potential for positive social impact.</p></details> |  |

Thus, we propose to explore the dense semantic information retained within LLMs' \textbf{IN}ternal \textbf{S}tates for halluc\textbf{I}nation \textbf{DE}tection (\textbf{INSIDE}). In particular, a simple yet effective \textbf{EigenScore} metric is proposed to better evaluate responses' self-consistency, which exploits the eigenvalues of responses' covariance matrix to measure the semantic consistency/diversity in the dense embedding space. Furthermore, from the perspective of self-consistent hallucination detection, a test time feature clipping approach is explored to truncate extreme activations in the internal states, which reduces overconfident generations and potentially benefits the detection of overconfident hallucinations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are performed on several popular LLMs and question-answering (QA) benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR-2024</p></details> |

We call this MPP, in contrast to conventional SPP that prompts an LLM with a single problem at a time. While MPP has been shown to work comparably well or even better than SPP under few-shot settings, its zero-shot performance is underexplored, which better reveals the innate multiple problem handling capabilities of LLMs. To address that, we study the zero-shot MPP performance of various LLMs on 6 classification and 12 reasoning benchmarks and confirm that LLMs are competent zero-shot multi-problem solvers. We also examine the conditions of effectiveness of zero-shot MPP and explore several model-level factors that may enable MPP. We observe that LLMs consistently perform worse with selecting indices of texts of a given class label and with multiple mixed-source reasoning problems, indicating a lack of true understanding. We also find that instruction tuning is an important factor than enhances MPP.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 11 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Parallel Program Performance Through DSL-Driven Code Generation with LLM Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15625v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mapping computations to processors and assigning data to memory are critical for maximizing performance in parallel programming. These mapping decisions are managed through the development of specialized low-level system code, called mappers, crafted by performance engineers. Each mapper is tailored to a specific application and optimized for the underlying machine architecture, a process that requires days of refinement and tuning from an expert. Despite advances in system research, automating mapper generation remains a challenge due to the complexity of making millions of decisions to find the optimal solution and generate the solution as code. We introduce an approach that leverages recent advances in LLM-based optimizers for mapper design. In under ten minutes, our method automatically discovers mappers that surpass human expert designs in scientific applications by up to 1.34X speedup. For parallel matrix multiplication algorithms, our mapper achieves up to 1.31X of the expert-designed solution. To achieve this, we simplify the complexity of low-level code generation by introducing a domain-specific language (DSL) that abstracts the low-level system programming details and defines a structured search space for LLMs to explore. To maximize the application performance, we use an LLM optimizer to improve an agentic system that generates the mapper code. As a result, this approach significantly reduces the workload for performance engineers while achieving substantial performance gains across diverse applications. Finally, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based optimization in system design and suggest its potential for addressing other complex system challenges.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

Though large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated encouraging potential in social media analytics, they lack thorough evaluation when in offensive language detection, particularly in multilingual environments. We for the first time evaluate multilingual offensive language detection of LLMs in three languages: English, Spanish, and German with three LLMs, GPT-3.5, Flan-T5, and Mistral, in both monolingual and multilingual settings. We further examine the impact of different prompt languages and augmented translation data for the task in non-English contexts. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of the inherent bias in LLMs and the datasets in the mispredictions related to sensitive topics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at UIC 2024 proceedings.

| **[Causally Testing Gender Bias in LLMs: A Case Study on Occupational Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10678v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generated texts from large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit a variety of harmful, human-like biases against various demographics. These findings motivate research efforts aiming to understand and measure such effects. This paper introduces a causal formulation for bias measurement in generative language models. Based on this theoretical foundation, we outline a list of desiderata for designing robust bias benchmarks. We then propose a benchmark called OccuGender, with a bias-measuring procedure to investigate occupational gender bias. We test several state-of-the-art open-source LLMs on OccuGender, including Llama, Mistral, and their instruction-tuned versions. The results show that these models exhibit substantial occupational gender bias. Lastly, we discuss prompting strategies for bias mitigation and an extension of our causal formulation to illustrate the generalizability of our framework.

| **[Chain of Ideas: Revolutionizing Research in Novel Idea Development with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13185v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective research ideation is a critical step for scientific research. However, the exponential increase in scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current with recent advances and identify meaningful research directions. Recent developments in large language models~(LLMs) suggest a promising avenue for automating the generation of novel research ideas. However, existing methods for idea generation either trivially prompt LLMs or directly expose LLMs to extensive literature without indicating useful information. Inspired by the research process of human researchers, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas~(CoI) agent, an LLM-based agent that organizes relevant literature in a chain structure to effectively mirror the progressive development in a research domain. This organization facilitates LLMs to capture the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that can comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different perspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers. Experimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other methods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation. Moreover, our CoI agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of \$0.50 to generate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,5 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Concept Bottleneck Models with LLM Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15555v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have been proposed as a compromise between white-box and black-box models, aiming to achieve interpretability without sacrificing accuracy. The standard training procedure for CBMs is to predefine a candidate set of human-interpretable concepts, extract their values from the training data, and identify a sparse subset as inputs to a transparent prediction model. However, such approaches are often hampered by the tradeoff between enumerating a sufficiently large set of concepts to include those that are truly relevant versus controlling the cost of obtaining concept extractions. This work investigates a novel approach that sidesteps these challenges: BC-LLM iteratively searches over a potentially infinite set of concepts within a Bayesian framework, in which Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as both a concept extraction mechanism and prior. BC-LLM is broadly applicable and multi-modal. Despite imperfections in LLMs, we prove that BC-LLM can provide rigorous statistical inference and uncertainty quantification. In experiments, it outperforms comparator methods including black-box models, converges more rapidly towards relevant concepts and away from spuriously correlated ones, and is more robust to out-of-distribution samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-IF: Benchmarking LLMs on Multi-Turn and Multilingual Instructions Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15553v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks, including instruction following, which is crucial for aligning model outputs with user expectations. However, evaluating LLMs' ability to follow instructions remains challenging due to the complexity and subjectivity of human language. Current benchmarks primarily focus on single-turn, monolingual instructions, which do not adequately reflect the complexities of real-world applications that require handling multi-turn and multilingual interactions. To address this gap, we introduce Multi-IF, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs' proficiency in following multi-turn and multilingual instructions. Multi-IF, which utilizes a hybrid framework combining LLM and human annotators, expands upon the IFEval by incorporating multi-turn sequences and translating the English prompts into another 7 languages, resulting in a dataset of 4,501 multilingual conversations, where each has three turns. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs on Multi-IF reveals that it presents a significantly more challenging task than existing benchmarks. All the models tested showed a higher rate of failure in executing instructions correctly with each additional turn. For example, o1-preview drops from 0.877 at the first turn to 0.707 at the third turn in terms of average accuracy over all languages. Moreover, languages with non-Latin scripts (Hindi, Russian, and Chinese) generally exhibit higher error rates, suggesting potential limitations in the models' multilingual capabilities. We release Multi-IF prompts and the evaluation code base to encourage further research in this critical area.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDP4Bit: Toward 4-bit Communication Quantization in Sharded Data Parallelism for LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15526v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a clear trend towards language models with an ever-increasing number of parameters, as well as the growing training overhead and memory usage. Distributed training, particularly through Sharded Data Parallelism (ShardedDP) which partitions optimizer states among workers, has emerged as a crucial technique to mitigate training time and memory usage. Yet, a major challenge in the scalability of ShardedDP is the intensive communication of weights and gradients. While compression techniques can alleviate this issue, they often result in worse accuracy. Driven by this limitation, we propose SDP4Bit (Toward 4Bit Communication Quantization in Sharded Data Parallelism for LLM Training), which effectively reduces the communication of weights and gradients to nearly 4 bits via two novel techniques: quantization on weight differences, and two-level gradient smooth quantization. Furthermore, SDP4Bit presents an algorithm-system co-design with runtime optimization to minimize the computation overhead of compression. In addition to the theoretical guarantees of convergence, we empirically evaluate the accuracy of SDP4Bit on the pre-training of GPT models with up to 6.7 billion parameters, and the results demonstrate a negligible impact on training loss. Furthermore, speed experiments show that SDP4Bit achieves up to 4.08$\times$ speedup in end-to-end throughput on a scale of 128 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Past work tests QA and RQA separately, but we test them jointly, comparing their difficulty, aiding benchmark design, and assessing reasoning consistency. 16 LLMs run QA and RQA with trivia questions/answers, showing: 1) Versus QA, LLMs are much less accurate in RQA for numerical answers, but slightly more accurate in RQA for textual answers; 2) LLMs often answer their own invalid questions from RQA accurately in QA, so RQA errors are not from knowledge gaps alone; 3) RQA errors correlate with question difficulty and inversely correlate with answer frequencies in the Dolma corpus; and 4) LLMs struggle to give valid multi-hop questions. By finding question and answer types yielding RQA errors, we suggest improvements for LLM RQA reasoning.</p></details> | In-progress preprint |
| **[Dynamic Intelligence Assessment: Benchmarking LLMs on the Road to AGI with a Focus on Model Confidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15490v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine intelligence evolves, the need to test and compare the problem-solving abilities of different AI models grows. However, current benchmarks are often overly simplistic, allowing models to perform uniformly well, making it difficult to distinguish their capabilities. Additionally, benchmarks typically rely on static question-answer pairs, which models might memorize or guess. To address these limitations, we introduce the Dynamic Intelligence Assessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic question templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as mathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The accompanying DIA-Bench dataset, which includes 150 diverse and challenging task templates with mutable parameters, is presented in various formats such as text, PDFs, compiled binaries, and visual puzzles. Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's reliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed that even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in varying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably, models like GPT-4o tended to overestimate their mathematical abilities, while ChatGPT-4o demonstrated better decision-making and performance through effective tool usage. We evaluated eight state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) using DIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often display unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions. The DIA framework sets a new standard for assessing not only problem-solving but also a model's adaptive intelligence and ability to assess its own limitations. The dataset is publicly available on our project's website.</p></details> |  |
| **["What is the value of {templates}?" Rethinking Document Information Extraction Datasets for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15484v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) for visually rich document understanding (VRDU) has kindled a need for prompt-response, document-based datasets. As annotating new datasets from scratch is labor-intensive, the existing literature has generated prompt-response datasets from available resources using simple templates. For the case of key information extraction (KIE), one of the most common VRDU tasks, past work has typically employed the template "What is the value for the {key}?". However, given the variety of questions encountered in the wild, simple and uniform templates are insufficient for creating robust models in research and industrial contexts. In this work, we present K2Q, a diverse collection of five datasets converted from KIE to a prompt-response format using a plethora of bespoke templates. The questions in K2Q can span multiple entities and be extractive or boolean. We empirically compare the performance of seven baseline generative models on K2Q with zero-shot prompting. We further compare three of these models when training on K2Q versus training on simpler templates to motivate the need of our work. We find that creating diverse and intricate KIE questions enhances the performance and robustness of VRDU models. We hope this work encourages future studies on data quality for generative model training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP Findings 2024</p></details> |

The widely adopted approach in post-training popular open-source LLMs is to sequentially perform SFT and RLHF/DPO. However, sequential training is sub-optimal in terms of SFT and RLHF/DPO trade-off: the LLM gradually forgets about the first stage's training when undergoing the second stage's training. We theoretically prove the sub-optimality of sequential post-training. Furthermore, we propose a practical joint post-training framework with theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically outperforms sequential post-training framework, while having similar computational cost.

However, many previous works studied textual and relational retrieval tasks as separate topics. To address the gap, we develop STARK, a large-scale Semi-structure retrieval benchmark on Textual and Relational Knowledge Bases. Our benchmark covers three domains: product search, academic paper search, and queries in precision medicine. We design a novel pipeline to synthesize realistic user queries that integrate diverse relational information and complex textual properties, together with their ground-truth answers (items). We conduct rigorous human evaluation to validate the quality of our synthesized queries. We further enhance the benchmark with high-quality human-generated queries to provide an authentic reference. STARK serves as a comprehensive testbed for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems driven by large language models (LLMs). Our experiments suggest that STARK presents significant challenges to the current retrieval and LLM systems, highlighting the need for more capable semi-structured retrieval systems.

| **[Evaluating Consistencies in LLM responses through a Semantic Clustering of Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15440v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of Large Language Model (LLM) functionalities, providing reliable information is paramount, yet reports suggest that LLM outputs lack consistency. This inconsistency, often at-tributed to randomness in token sampling, under-mines user trust as it leads to varying responses even for identical queries. In this paper, we present a new approach for evaluating semantic consistencies of LLM including comparison of alternative tech-niques. Our approach evaluates whether LLM re-sponses are semantically congruent for a given question, recognizing that as syntactically different sentences may convey the same meaning. Here-tofore, To enhance LLM consistency, two main approaches have been explored: Leverage external knowledge as context like the RAG pattern or use Zero-shot-CoT to improve performance of LLM itself. We apply our evaluation approach to these techniques, and demonstrate to compare the im-pact of these methods on LLM response con-sistency across different domains of question an-swering tasks. Using the TruthfulQA dataset to assess LLM responses, the study induces N re-sponses per question from the LLM and clusters semantically equivalent sentences to measure semantic consistency across 37 categories. Through this, it quantitatively analyzes the effectiveness of the aforementioned methods in improving LLM performance before and after their adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Trustworthy AI Workshop at IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

While existing research seeks to enhance RAG performance by retrieving higher-quality documents or designing RAG-specific LLMs, the internal mechanisms within LLMs that contribute to the effectiveness of RAG systems remain underexplored. In this paper, we aim to investigate these internal mechanisms within the popular Mixture-of-Expert (MoE)-based LLMs and demonstrate how to improve RAG by examining expert activations in these LLMs. Our controlled experiments reveal that several core groups of experts are primarily responsible for RAG-related behaviors. The activation of these core experts can signify the model's inclination towards external/internal knowledge and adjust its behavior. For instance, we identify core experts that can (1) indicate the sufficiency of the model's internal knowledge, (2) assess the quality of retrieved documents, and (3) enhance the model's ability to utilize context. Based on these findings, we propose several strategies to enhance RAG's efficiency and effectiveness through expert activation. Experimental results across various datasets and MoE-based LLMs show the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tandem Transformers for Inference Efficient LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08644v4)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autoregressive nature of conventional large language models (LLMs) inherently limits inference speed, as tokens are generated sequentially. While speculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they face limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation or failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations. We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these issues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model and (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens simultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially enhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations. On the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko demonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a standalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter model with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem model within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model validates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster than using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream task accuracy.</p></details> |  |

With capabilities such as reconnaissance, exploitation, and command execution, LLMs could soon become integral to autonomous cyber agents, capable of launching highly sophisticated attacks. In this paper, we introduce novel defense strategies that exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of attacking LLMs. By targeting weaknesses such as biases, trust in input, memory limitations, and their tunnel-vision approach to problem-solving, we develop techniques to mislead, delay, or neutralize these autonomous agents. We evaluate our defenses under black-box conditions, starting with single prompt-response scenarios and progressing to real-world tests using custom-built CTF machines. Our results show defense success rates of up to 90\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of turning LLM vulnerabilities into defensive strategies against LLM-driven cyber threats.</p></details> |  |

However, when applied to pairwise comparisons of candidate responses, LLM-based evaluators often exhibit selection bias. Specifically, their judgments may become inconsistent when the option positions or ID tokens are swapped, compromising the effectiveness and fairness of the evaluation result. To address this challenge, we introduce CalibraEval, a novel label-free method for mitigating selection bias during inference. Specifically, CalibraEval reformulates debiasing as an optimization task aimed at adjusting observed prediction distributions to align with unbiased prediction distributions. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a non-parametric order-preserving algorithm (NOA). This algorithm leverages the partial order relationships between model prediction distributions, thereby eliminating the need for explicit labels and precise mathematical function modeling.Empirical evaluations of LLMs in multiple representative benchmarks demonstrate that CalibraEval effectively mitigates selection bias and improves performance compared to existing debiasing methods. This work marks a step toward building more robust and unbiased automated evaluation frameworks, paving the way for improved reliability in AI-driven assessments</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[CompAct: Compressed Activations for Memory-Efficient LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15352v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CompAct, a technique that reduces peak memory utilization on GPU by 25-30% for pretraining and 50% for fine-tuning of LLMs. Peak device memory is a major limiting factor in training LLMs, with various recent works aiming to reduce model memory. However most works don't target the largest component of allocated memory during training: the model's compute graph, which is stored for the backward pass. By storing low-rank, compressed activations to be used in the backward pass we greatly reduce the required memory, unlike previous methods which only reduce optimizer overheads or the number of trained parameters. Our compression uses random projection matrices, thus avoiding additional memory overheads. Comparisons with previous techniques for either pretraining or fine-tuning show that CompAct substantially improves existing compute-performance tradeoffs. We expect CompAct's savings to scale even higher for larger models.</p></details> |  |

However, the accuracy of hate speech detection systems heavily relies on human-labeled data, which is inherently susceptible to biases. While previous work has examined the issue, the interplay between the characteristics of the annotator and those of the target of the hate are still unexplored. We fill this gap by leveraging an extensive dataset with rich socio-demographic information of both annotators and targets, uncovering how human biases manifest in relation to the target's attributes. Our analysis surfaces the presence of widespread biases, which we quantitatively describe and characterize based on their intensity and prevalence, revealing marked differences. Furthermore, we compare human biases with those exhibited by persona-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that while persona-based LLMs do exhibit biases, these differ significantly from those of human annotators. Overall, our work offers new and nuanced results on human biases in hate speech annotations, as well as fresh insights into the design of AI-driven hate speech detection systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing literature relevant to LLM uncertainty estimation often relies on heuristic approaches, lacking systematic classification of the methods. In this survey, we clarify the definitions of uncertainty and confidence, highlighting their distinctions and implications for model predictions. On this basis, we integrate theoretical perspectives, including Bayesian inference, information theory, and ensemble strategies, to categorize various classes of uncertainty estimation methods derived from heuristic approaches. Additionally, we address challenges that arise when applying these methods to LLMs. We also explore techniques for incorporating uncertainty into diverse applications, including out-of-distribution detection, data annotation, and question clarification. Our review provides insights into uncertainty estimation from both definitional and theoretical angles, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of this critical aspect in LLMs. We aim to inspire the development of more reliable and effective uncertainty estimation approaches for LLMs in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Guiding LLMs to Explore Multi-Perspective Team Tactic in the Game](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15311v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal AI agents in complex tasks but still face challenges in open decision-making problems within complex scenarios. To address this, we use the language logic game ``Who is Undercover?'' (WIU) as an experimental platform to propose the Multi-Perspective Team Tactic (MPTT) framework. MPTT aims to cultivate LLMs' human-like language expression logic, multi-dimensional thinking, and self-perception in complex scenarios. By alternating speaking and voting sessions, integrating techniques like self-perspective, identity-determination, self-reflection, self-summary and multi-round find-teammates, LLM agents make rational decisions through strategic concealment and communication, fostering human-like trust. Preliminary results show that MPTT, combined with WIU, leverages LLMs' cognitive capabilities to create a decision-making framework that can simulate real society. This framework aids minority groups in communication and expression, promoting fairness and diversity in decision-making. Additionally, our Human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that LLMs can learn and align with human behaviors through interactive, indicating their potential for active participation in societal decision-making.</p></details> |  |

However, their capabilities remain limited when addressing domain-specific problems, particularly in downstream NLP tasks. Research has shown that models fine-tuned on instruction-based downstream NLP datasets outperform those that are not fine-tuned. While most efforts in this area have primarily focused on resource-rich languages like English and broad domains, little attention has been given to multilingual settings and specific domains. To address this gap, this study focuses on developing a specialized LLM, LlamaLens, for analyzing news and social media content in a multilingual context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to tackle both domain specificity and multilinguality, with a particular focus on news and social media. Our experimental setup includes 19 tasks, represented by 52 datasets covering Arabic, English, and Hindi. We demonstrate that LlamaLens outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 16 testing sets, and achieves comparable performance on 10 sets. We make the models and resources publicly available for the research community.(https://huggingface.co/QCRI)</p></details> | <details><summary>LLMs,...</summary><p>LLMs, Multilingual, Language Diversity, Large Language Models, Social Media, News Media, Specialized LLMs, Fact-checking, Media Analysis</p></details> |

Leveraging adversarial debate and a novel dual entropy theory, EVINCE improves prediction accuracy, robustness, and stability in LLMs by integrating statistical modeling, information theory, and machine learning to balance diverse perspective exploration with strong prior exploitation. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through consistent convergence of information-theoretic metrics, particularly improved mutual information, fostering productive LLM collaboration. We apply $\EVINCE$ to healthcare, showing improved disease diagnosis, and discuss its broader implications for decision-making across domains. This work provides theoretical foundations and empirical validation for $\EVINCE$, paving the way for advancements in LLM collaboration and AGI development.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.15808</p></details> |
| **[Attention Is All You Need for LLM-based Code Vulnerability Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15288v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of software systems and the growing number of reported vulnerabilities have emphasized the importance of accurately identifying vulnerable code segments. Traditional methods for vulnerability localization, such as manual code audits or rule-based tools, are often time-consuming and limited in scope, typically focusing on specific programming languages or types of vulnerabilities. In recent years, the introduction of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA has opened new possibilities for automating vulnerability detection. However, while LLMs show promise in this area, they face challenges, particularly in maintaining accuracy over longer code contexts. This paper introduces LOVA, a novel framework leveraging the self-attention mechanisms inherent in LLMs to enhance vulnerability localization. Our key insight is that self-attention mechanisms assign varying importance to different parts of the input, making it possible to track how much attention the model focuses on specific lines of code. In the context of vulnerability localization, the hypothesis is that vulnerable lines of code will naturally attract higher attention weights because they have a greater influence on the model's output. By systematically tracking changes in attention weights and focusing on specific lines of code, LOVA improves the precision of identifying vulnerable lines across various programming languages. Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate that LOVA significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches, achieving up to a 5.3x improvement in F1-scores. LOVA also demonstrated strong scalability, with up to a 14.6x improvement in smart contract vulnerability localization across languages like C, Python, Java, and Solidity. Its robustness was proven through consistent performance across different LLM architectures.</p></details> |  |

Current LLM-based agents require lengthy inference times and face challenges in interacting with real-time autonomous driving environments. A key open question is whether we can effectively leverage the knowledge from LLMs to train an efficient and robust Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This paper introduces RAPID, a novel \underline{\textbf{R}}obust \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive \underline{\textbf{P}}olicy \underline{\textbf{I}}nfusion and \underline{\textbf{D}}istillation framework, which trains specialized mix-of-policy RL agents using data synthesized by an LLM-based driving agent and online adaptation. RAPID features three key designs: 1) utilization of offline data collected from an LLM agent to distil expert knowledge into RL policies for faster real-time inference; 2) introduction of robust distillation in RL to inherit both performance and robustness from LLM-based teacher; and 3) employment of a mix-of-policy approach for joint decision decoding with a policy adapter. Through fine-tuning via online environment interaction, RAPID reduces the forgetting of LLM knowledge while maintaining adaptability to different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate RAPID's capability to effectively integrate LLM knowledge into scaled-down RL policies in an efficient, adaptable, and robust way. Code and checkpoints will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of traditional topic models often relies on sufficient word co-occurrence, which is lacking in short texts. Therefore, existing approaches, whether probabilistic or neural, frequently struggle to extract meaningful patterns from such data, resulting in incoherent topics. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extend short texts into more detailed sequences before applying topic modeling. To further improve the efficiency and solve the problem of semantic inconsistency from LLM-generated texts, we propose to use prefix tuning to train a smaller language model coupled with a variational autoencoder for short-text topic modeling. Our method significantly improves short-text topic modeling performance, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on real-world datasets with extreme data sparsity, outperforming current state-of-the-art topic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP Findings 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2310.15420</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a targeted method that incorporates the clinical domain knowledge into LLMs to improve their ability to detect anomalies. We introduce the Metabolism Pathway-driven Prompting (MPP) method, which integrates the information about metabolic pathways to better capture the structural and temporal changes in biological samples. We applied our method for doping detection in sports, focusing on steroid metabolism, and evaluated using real-world data from athletes. The results show that our method improves anomaly detection performance by leveraging metabolic context, providing a more nuanced and accurate prediction of suspicious samples in athletes' profiles.</p></details> |  |

In the field of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programming, previous researchers have focused on using LLMs to generate Structured Text (ST) language, and created automatic programming workflows based on it. The IEC 61131 graphic programming languages, which still has the most users, have however been overlooked. In this paper we explore using LLMs to generate graphic languages in ASCII art to provide assistance to engineers. Our series of experiments indicate that, contrary to what researchers usually think, it is possible to generate a correct Sequential Function Chart (SFC) for simple requirements when LLM is provided with several examples. On the other hand, generating a Ladder Diagram (LD) automatically remains a challenge even for very simple use cases. The automatic conversion between LD and SFC without extra information also fails when using prompt engineering alone.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, LLM users are now encouraged or required to disclose the use of LLM-generated content for varied types of real-world tasks. However, an emerging phenomenon, users' secret use of LLM, raises challenges in ensuring end users adhere to the transparency requirement. Our study used mixed-methods with an exploratory survey (125 real-world secret use cases reported) and a controlled experiment among 300 users to investigate the contexts and causes behind the secret use of LLMs. We found that such secretive behavior is often triggered by certain tasks, transcending demographic and personality differences among users. Task types were found to affect users' intentions to use secretive behavior, primarily through influencing perceived external judgment regarding LLM usage. Our results yield important insights for future work on designing interventions to encourage more transparent disclosure of the use of LLMs or other AI technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 3 figures, and accepted at CSCW 2025</p></details> |

Previous state-of-the-art work has focused on modeling thematic fit through distributional or neural models of event representation, trained in a supervised fashion with indirect labels. In this work, we assess whether pre-trained autoregressive LLMs possess consistent, expressible knowledge about thematic fit. We evaluate both closed and open state-of-the-art LLMs on several psycholinguistic datasets, along three axes: (1) Reasoning Form: multi-step logical reasoning (chain-of-thought prompting) vs. simple prompting. (2) Input Form: providing context (generated sentences) vs. raw tuples <predicate, argument, role>. (3) Output Form: categorical vs. numeric. Our results show that chain-of-thought reasoning is more effective on datasets with self-explanatory semantic role labels, especially Location. Generated sentences helped only in few settings, and lowered results in many others. Predefined categorical (compared to numeric) output raised GPT's results across the board with few exceptions, but lowered Llama's. We saw that semantically incoherent generated sentences, which the models lack the ability to consistently filter out, hurt reasoning and overall performance too. Our GPT-powered methods set new state-of-the-art on all tested datasets.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

Our survey on 52 recent such systems uncovers a severe lack of diversity, with a heavy reliance on dictatorial and plurality voting for CDM. Through the lens of social choice theory, we scrutinize widely-adopted CDM methods and identify their limitations. To enrich current landscape of LLM-based CDM, we present GEDI, an electoral CDM module that incorporates various ordinal preferential voting mechanisms. Our empirical case study across three benchmarks shows that the integration of certain CDM methods can markedly improve the reasoning capabilities and robustness of some leading LLMs, all without requiring intricate system designs. Additionally, we find that some CDM mechanisms generate positive synergies even with as few as three agents. The voting-based methods also demonstrate robustness against single points of failure, as well as diversity in terms of hit-rate@k and subject-wise impacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful code analysis capabilities, but their static training data and privacy risks limit their effectiveness. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we propose LSAST, a novel approach that integrates LLMs with SAST scanners to enhance vulnerability detection. LSAST leverages a locally hostable LLM, combined with a state-of-the-art knowledge retrieval system, to provide up-to-date vulnerability insights without compromising data privacy. We set a new benchmark for static vulnerability analysis, offering a robust, privacy-conscious solution that bridges the gap between traditional scanners and advanced AI-driven analysis. Our evaluation demonstrates that incorporating SAST results into LLM analysis significantly improves detection accuracy, identifying vulnerabilities missed by conventional methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review of IEEE SaTML 2024</p></details> |

However, the automation sector, especially in motion control, continues to rely heavily on manual programming due to the complexity of tasks and critical safety considerations. In this domain, incorrect code execution can pose risks to both machinery and personnel, necessitating specialized expertise. To address these challenges, we introduce MCCoder, an LLM-powered system designed to generate code that addresses complex motion control tasks, with integrated soft-motion data verification. MCCoder enhances code generation through multitask decomposition, hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and self-correction with a private motion library. Moreover, it supports data verification by logging detailed trajectory data and providing simulations and plots, allowing users to assess the accuracy of the generated code and bolstering confidence in LLM-based programming. To ensure robust validation, we propose MCEVAL, an evaluation dataset with metrics tailored to motion control tasks of varying difficulties. Experiments indicate that MCCoder improves performance by 11.61% overall and by 66.12% on complex tasks in MCEVAL dataset compared with base models with naive RAG. This system and dataset aim to facilitate the application of code generation in automation settings with strict safety requirements.

However, previous studies on explanation generation has shown several limitations, such as being confined to English scenarios, involving overly complex inference processes, and not fully unleashing the potential of the mutual feedback between veracity labels and explanation texts. To address these issues, we construct two complex fact-checking datasets in the Chinese scenarios: CHEF-EG and TrendFact. These datasets involve complex facts in areas such as health, politics, and society, presenting significant challenges for fact verification methods. In response to these challenges, we propose a unified framework called FactISR (Augmenting Fact-Checking via Iterative Self-Revision) to perform mutual feedback between veracity and explanations by leveraging the capabilities of large language models(LLMs). FactISR uses a single model to address tasks such as fact verification and explanation generation. Its self-revision mechanism can further revision the consistency between veracity labels, explanation texts, and evidence, as well as eliminate irrelevant noise. We conducted extensive experiments with baselines and FactISR on the proposed datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Designing Effective RL Reward at Training Time for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15115v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models have been increasingly critical for improving the reasoning capability of LLMs. Existing research has shown that a well-trained reward model can substantially improve model performances at inference time via search. However, the potential of reward models during RL training time still remains largely under-explored. It is currently unclear whether these reward models can provide additional training signals to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in RL training that uses sparse success rewards, which verify the correctness of solutions. In this work, we evaluate popular reward models for RL training, including the Outcome-supervised Reward Model (ORM) and the Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM), and train a collection of LLMs for math problems using RL by combining these learned rewards with success rewards. Surprisingly, even though these learned reward models have strong inference-time performances, they may NOT help or even hurt RL training, producing worse performances than LLMs trained with the success reward only. Our analysis reveals that an LLM can receive high rewards from some of these reward models by repeating correct but unnecessary reasoning steps, leading to a severe reward hacking issue. Therefore, we introduce two novel reward refinement techniques, including Clipping and Delta. The key idea is to ensure the accumulative reward of any reasoning trajectory is upper-bounded to keep a learned reward model effective without being exploited. We evaluate our techniques with multiple reward models over a set of 1.5B and 7B LLMs on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks and demonstrate that with a carefully designed reward function, RL training without any additional supervised tuning can improve all the evaluated LLMs, including the state-of-the-art 7B LLM Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Detecting and classifying them is a crucial NLP task to prevent misinformation, manipulative claims, and biased decisions. However, existing fallacy classifiers are limited by the requirement for sufficient labeled data for training, which hinders their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities. In this paper, we focus on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot fallacy classification. To elicit fallacy-related knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs, we propose diverse single-round and multi-round prompting schemes, applying different task-specific instructions such as extraction, summarization, and Chain-of-Thought reasoning. With comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we suggest that LLMs could be potential zero-shot fallacy classifiers. In general, LLMs under single-round prompting schemes have achieved acceptable zero-shot performances compared to the best full-shot baselines and can outperform them in all OOD inference scenarios and some open-domain tasks. Our novel multi-round prompting schemes can effectively bring about more improvements, especially for small LLMs. Our analysis further underlines the future research on zero-shot fallacy classification.

We introduce Adanonymizer, an anonymization plug-in that allows users to control this balance by navigating a trade-off curve. A survey (N=221) revealed a privacy paradox, where users frequently disclosed sensitive information despite acknowledging privacy risks. The study further demonstrated that privacy risks were not significantly correlated with model output performance, highlighting the potential to navigate this trade-off. Adanonymizer normalizes privacy and utility ratings by type and automates the pseudonymization of sensitive terms based on user preferences, significantly reducing user effort. Its 2D color palette interface visualizes the privacy-utility trade-off, allowing users to adjust the balance by manipulating a point. An evaluation (N=36) compared Adanonymizer with ablation methods and differential privacy techniques, where Adanonymizer significantly reduced modification time, achieved better perceived model performance and overall user preference.</p></details> |  |

It caches states of self-attention to avoid recomputation. Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with ultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the KV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the used static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts. Remedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic eviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual information. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache eviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context as input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context eviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags and only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The Attention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially plugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our method is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and adaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves higher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional training-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many tokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE, where it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.</p></details> |  |

Listening affords people more mobility than reading by seeing, thus broadening learning opportunities. This study explores the potential applications of large language models (LLMs) to adapt text documents into audio content, addressing the lack of listening-friendly materials for niche content like research papers. LLMs can generate scripts of audio content in various styles tailored to specific needs, such as the duration of the content and whether it is a monologue or dialogue. To explore this potential, we developed PaperWave, a prototype that transforms academic paper PDFs into conversational podcasts. Our two-month investigation involving 11 participants (including the authors) employed autobiographical design, a field study, and a design workshop. The findings highlight the importance of considering listeners' interaction with their environment when designing document-to-audio systems.</p></details> |  |

The analysis, including k-core techniques, identified critical nodes and relationships that are central to understanding the disorder. Building on these findings, we curated a knowledge graph that is usable in a context-aware chatbot (Graph-RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling accurate and informed interactions. Our knowledge graph not only advances the understanding of ADHD but also provides a powerful tool for research and clinical applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

To address this, we propose MemoAnalyzer, a system for identifying, visualizing, and managing private information within memories. A semi-structured interview (N=40) revealed that low privacy awareness was the primary challenge, while proactive privacy control emerged as the most common user need. MemoAnalyzer uses a prompt-based method to infer and identify sensitive information from aggregated past inputs, allowing users to easily modify sensitive content. Background color temperature and transparency are mapped to inference confidence and sensitivity, streamlining privacy adjustments. A 5-day evaluation (N=36) comparing MemoAnalyzer with the default GPT setting and a manual modification baseline showed MemoAnalyzer significantly improved privacy awareness and protection without compromising interaction speed. Our study contributes to privacy-conscious LLM design, offering insights into privacy protection for Human-AI interactions.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces an adaptive retrieval augmented framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that aligns with human instructions through Instruction Tuning and incorporates market feedback to dynamically adjust weights across various knowledge sources within the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Building upon foundational models like LLaMA 2, we fine-tune a series of LLMs ranging from 7B to 70B in size, enriched with Instruction Tuning and RAG, and further optimized through direct feedback and Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based refinement methods applied to the source weights of RAG.Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that the sentiment outputs from our LLMs more accurately mirror the intrinsic sentiment of textual data, showcasing a 1% to 6% boost in accuracy and F1 score over existing state-of-the-art models and leading conversational AI systems. Moreover, the sentiments extracted are more indicative of the directions in stock price movements. On top of that, we successfully construct portfolios that yield a 3.61% higher Sharpe ratio compared to the S&P 500 baseline in bullish markets. These portfolios also demonstrate resilience in bearish markets, with a 5x reduction in return losses compared to those typically experienced by the S&P 500.</p></details> |  |

These agent-based systems represent an emerging shift in personal computing. We contribute to the security foundations of agent-based systems and surface a new class of automatically computed obfuscated adversarial prompt attacks that violate the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to an LLM agent. We show how prompt optimization techniques can find such prompts automatically given the weights of a model. We demonstrate that such attacks transfer to production-level agents. For example, we show an information exfiltration attack on Mistral's LeChat agent that analyzes a user's conversation, picks out personally identifiable information, and formats it into a valid markdown command that results in leaking that data to the attacker's server. This attack shows a nearly 80% success rate in an end-to-end evaluation. We conduct a range of experiments to characterize the efficacy of these attacks and find that they reliably work on emerging agent-based systems like Mistral's LeChat, ChatGLM, and Meta's Llama. These attacks are multimodal, and we show variants in the text-only and image domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website: imprompter.ai code: https://github.com/Reapor-Yurnero/imprompter</p></details> |

We hypothesize that a core missing component is a lack of diverse LLM outputs, leading to inefficient search due to models repeatedly sampling highly similar, yet incorrect generations. We empirically demonstrate that this lack of diversity can be mitigated by searching over candidate plans for solving a problem in natural language. Based on this insight, we propose PlanSearch, a novel search algorithm which shows strong results across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and LiveCodeBench (a contamination-free benchmark for competitive coding). PlanSearch generates a diverse set of observations about the problem and then uses these observations to construct plans for solving the problem. By searching over plans in natural language rather than directly over code solutions, PlanSearch explores a significantly more diverse range of potential solutions compared to baseline search methods. Using PlanSearch on top of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves a state-of-the-art pass@200 of 77.0% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming both the best score achieved without search (pass@1 = 41.4%) and using standard repeated sampling (pass@200 = 60.6%). Finally, we show that, across all models, search algorithms, and benchmarks analyzed, we can accurately predict performance gains due to search as a direct function of the diversity over generated ideas.

Traditionally, processing sensor data requires profound theoretical knowledge and proficiency in signal-processing tools. However, recent works show that Large Language Models (LLMs) have promising capabilities in processing sensory data, suggesting their potential as copilots for developing sensing systems. To explore this potential, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, SensorBench, to establish a quantifiable objective. The benchmark incorporates diverse real-world sensor datasets for various tasks. The results show that while LLMs exhibit considerable proficiency in simpler tasks, they face inherent challenges in processing compositional tasks with parameter selections compared to engineering experts. Additionally, we investigate four prompting strategies for sensor processing and show that self-verification can outperform all other baselines in 48% of tasks. Our study provides a comprehensive benchmark and prompting analysis for future developments, paving the way toward an LLM-based sensor processing copilot.</p></details> |  |

They also excel in answering questions pertaining to natural language inference and commonsense reasoning. Composing these questions is itself a skilled writing task, so in this paper we consider LLMs as authors of commonsense assessment items. We prompt LLMs to generate items in the style of a prominent benchmark for commonsense reasoning, the Choice of Plausible Alternatives (COPA). We examine the outcome according to analyses facilitated by the LLMs and human annotation. We find that LLMs that succeed in answering the original COPA benchmark are also more successful in authoring their own items.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

A Detailed Analysis of Potential Factors Contributing to Difficulties in LLM Text Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14875v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs increase in accessibility, LLM-generated texts have proliferated across several fields, such as scientific, academic, and creative writing. However, LLMs are not created equally; they may have different architectures and training datasets. Thus, some LLMs may be more challenging to detect than others. Using two datasets spanning four total writing domains, we train AI-generated (AIG) text classifiers using the LibAUC library - a deep learning library for training classifiers with imbalanced datasets. Our results in the Deepfake Text dataset show that AIG-text detection varies across domains, with scientific writing being relatively challenging. In the Rewritten Ivy Panda (RIP) dataset focusing on student essays, we find that the OpenAI family of LLMs was substantially difficult for our classifiers to distinguish from human texts. Additionally, we explore possible factors that could explain the difficulties in detecting OpenAI-generated texts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024 - Safe Generative AI Workshop</p></details> |
| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |

Our key idea is to impose syntactic and semantic biases on programs generated by LLMs, such that the synthesized program is more amenable to automated verification. Based on this idea, we propose a novel specification-verification tool, built on top of Verified Software Toolchain, that help automate the process. Our experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks drawn from the deductive program synthesis community, shows that this approach is scalable and extensible. The benchmarks constitute of specifications comprising of basic coding examples, Separation Logic based assertions, and API specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making LLMs Vulnerable to Prompt Injection via Poisoning Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14827v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a prompt injection attack, an attacker injects a prompt into the original one, aiming to make the LLM follow the injected prompt and perform a task chosen by the attacker. Existing prompt injection attacks primarily focus on how to blend the injected prompt into the original prompt without altering the LLM itself. Our experiments show that these attacks achieve some success, but there is still significant room for improvement. In this work, we show that an attacker can boost the success of prompt injection attacks by poisoning the LLM's alignment process. Specifically, we propose PoisonedAlign, a method to strategically create poisoned alignment samples. When even a small fraction of the alignment data is poisoned using our method, the aligned LLM becomes more vulnerable to prompt injection while maintaining its foundational capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/Sadcardation/PoisonedAlign</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Multilingual LLMs to Low-Resource Languages using Continued Pre-training and Synthetic Corpus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14815v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual LLMs support a variety of languages; however, their performance is suboptimal for low-resource languages. In this work, we emphasize the importance of continued pre-training of multilingual LLMs and the use of translation-based synthetic pre-training corpora for improving LLMs in low-resource languages. We conduct our study in the context of the low-resource Indic language Hindi. We introduce Nemotron-Mini-Hindi 4B, a bilingual SLM supporting both Hindi and English, based on Nemotron-Mini 4B. The model is trained using a mix of real and synthetic Hindi + English tokens, with continuous pre-training performed on 400B tokens. We demonstrate that both the base and instruct models achieve state-of-the-art results on Hindi benchmarks while remaining competitive on English tasks. Additionally, we observe that the continued pre-training approach enhances the model's overall factual accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distance between Relevant Information Pieces Causes Bias in Long-Context LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14641v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positional bias in large language models (LLMs) hinders their ability to effectively process long inputs. A prominent example is the "lost in the middle" phenomenon, where LLMs struggle to utilize relevant information situated in the middle of the input. While prior research primarily focuses on single pieces of relevant information, real-world applications often involve multiple relevant information pieces. To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. Thorough experiments are conducted with five commercial and six open-source models. These experiments reveal that while most current models are robust against the "lost in the middle" issue, there exist significant biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating and reducing positional biases to advance LLM's capabilities.</p></details> | work in progress |

Previous training-free embedding methods have mainly focused on optimizing embedding prompts and have overlooked the benefits of utilizing the generative abilities of LLMs. We propose a novel method, GenEOL, which uses LLMs to generate diverse transformations of a sentence that preserve its meaning, and aggregates the resulting embeddings of these transformations to enhance the overall sentence embedding. GenEOL significantly outperforms the existing training-free embedding methods by an average of 2.85 points across several LLMs on the sentence semantic text similarity (STS) benchmark. Our analysis shows that GenEOL stabilizes representation quality across LLM layers and is robust to perturbations of embedding prompts. GenEOL also achieves notable gains on multiple clustering, reranking and pair-classification tasks from the MTEB benchmark.</p></details> |  |

| **[DiSCo Meets LLMs: A Unified Approach for Sparse Retrieval and Contextual Distillation in Conversational Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14609v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Search (CS) is the task of retrieving relevant documents from a corpus within a conversational context, combining retrieval with conversational context modeling. With the explosion of Large Language Models (LLMs), the CS field has seen major improvements with LLMs rewriting user queries, accounting for conversational context. However, engaging LLMs at inference time harms efficiency. Current methods address this by distilling embeddings from human-rewritten queries to learn the context modeling task. Yet, these approaches predominantly focus on context modeling, and only treat the contrastive component of the retrieval task within a distillation-independent loss term. To address these limitations, we propose a new distillation method, as a relaxation of the previous objective, unifying retrieval and context modeling. We relax the existing training objectives by distilling similarity scores between conversations and documents, rather than relying solely on representation learning. Our proposed distillation objective allows for more freedom in the representation space and leverages the contrastive nature of document relevance. Through experiments on Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) across 5 CS datasets, our approach demonstrates substantial improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval performance, outperforming state-of-the-art with gains of up to 6 points in recall for out-of-domain datasets. Additionally, through the relaxation of the objective, we propose a multi-teacher distillation, using multiple LLMs as teachers, yielding additional gains, and outperforming the teachers themselves in in-domain experiments. Finally, analysis of the sparsity of the models reveals that our distillation allows for better control over the sparsity of the trained models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs estimate uncertainty well in instruction-following?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14582v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) could be valuable personal AI agents across various domains, provided they can precisely follow user instructions. However, recent studies have shown significant limitations in LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, raising concerns about their reliability in high-stakes applications. Accurately estimating LLMs' uncertainty in adhering to instructions is critical to mitigating deployment risks. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic evaluation of the uncertainty estimation abilities of LLMs in the context of instruction-following. Our study identifies key challenges with existing instruction-following benchmarks, where multiple factors are entangled with uncertainty stems from instruction-following, complicating the isolation and comparison across methods and models. To address these issues, we introduce a controlled evaluation setup with two benchmark versions of data, enabling a comprehensive comparison of uncertainty estimation methods under various conditions. Our findings show that existing uncertainty methods struggle, particularly when models make subtle errors in instruction following. While internal model states provide some improvement, they remain inadequate in more complex scenarios. The insights from our controlled evaluation setups provide a crucial understanding of LLMs' limitations and potential for uncertainty estimation in instruction-following tasks, paving the way for more trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> |  |

These LLM agents are often paired with web-based tools, enabling access to diverse sources and real-time information. Although these advancements offer significant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk of malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information. In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails. Our experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM agents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, up to 93.9% of impersonation posts created by LLM agents were evaluated as authentic, and the click rate for links in spear phishing emails created by LLM agents reached up to 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing safeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for more robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs "know" internally when they follow instructions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14516v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-following is crucial for building AI agents with large language models (LLMs), as these models must adhere strictly to user-provided constraints and guidelines. However, LLMs often fail to follow even simple and clear instructions. To improve instruction-following behavior and prevent undesirable outputs, a deeper understanding of how LLMs' internal states relate to these outcomes is required. Our analysis of LLM internal states reveal a dimension in the input embedding space linked to successful instruction-following. We demonstrate that modifying representations along this dimension improves instruction-following success rates compared to random changes, without compromising response quality. Further investigation reveals that this dimension is more closely related to the phrasing of prompts rather than the inherent difficulty of the task or instructions. This discovery also suggests explanations for why LLMs sometimes fail to follow clear instructions and why prompt engineering is often effective, even when the content remains largely unchanged. This work provides insight into the internal workings of LLMs' instruction-following, paving the way for reliable LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

Deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications such as medicine, however, brings in many concerns. One major area of concern relates to biased behaviors of LLMs in medical applications, leading to unfair treatment of individuals. To pave the way for the responsible and impactful deployment of Med LLMs, rigorous evaluation is a key prerequisite. Due to the huge complexity and variability of different medical scenarios, existing work in this domain has primarily relied on using manually crafted datasets for bias evaluation. In this study, we present a new method to scale up such bias evaluations by automatically generating test cases based on rigorous medical evidence. We specifically target the challenges of a) domain-specificity of bias characterization, b) hallucinating while generating the test cases, and c) various dependencies between the health outcomes and sensitive attributes. To that end, we offer new methods to address these challenges integrated with our generative pipeline, using medical knowledge graphs, medical ontologies, and customized general LLM evaluation frameworks in our method. Through a series of extensive experiments, we show that the test cases generated by our proposed method can effectively reveal bias patterns in Med LLMs at larger and more flexible scales than human-crafted datasets. We publish a large bias evaluation dataset using our pipeline, which is dedicated to a few medical case studies. A live demo of our application for vignette generation is available at https://vignette.streamlit.app. Our code is also available at https://github.com/healthylaife/autofair.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Study of Cross-Layer KV Sharing for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14442v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, sharing key-value (KV) cache across layers has been found effective in efficient inference of large language models (LLMs). To systematically investigate different techniques of cross-layer KV sharing, we propose a unified framework that covers several recent methods and their novel variants. We conduct comprehensive experiments on all the configurations of the framework, evaluating their generation throughput and performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. We find that when reducing the size of the KV cache by 2x, most configurations can achieve competitive performance to and higher throughput than standard transformers, but when further reducing the size of the KV cache, pairing queries of all layers with KVs of upper layers can better maintain performance, although it also introduces additional training cost and prefilling latency. We hope that this work will help users choose the appropriate approach according to their requirements and facilitate research on the acceleration of LLM inference.</p></details> |  |

However, PEFT has been proven vulnerable to malicious attacks. Research indicates that poisoned LLMs, even after PEFT, retain the capability to activate internalized backdoors when input samples contain predefined triggers. In this paper, we introduce a novel weak-to-strong unlearning algorithm to defend against backdoor attacks based on feature alignment knowledge distillation, named W2SDefense. Specifically, we first train a small-scale language model through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the clean teacher model. Then, this teacher model guides the large-scale poisoned student model in unlearning the backdoor, leveraging PEFT. Theoretical analysis suggests that W2SDefense has the potential to enhance the student model's ability to unlearn backdoor features, preventing the activation of the backdoor. We conduct experiments on text classification tasks involving three state-of-the-art language models and three different backdoor attack algorithms. Our empirical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of W2SDefense in defending against backdoor attacks without compromising model performance.</p></details> |  |

More recently, multi-agent systems with LLM-based agents (Multi-LLM) have been utilized increasingly more for QA. In these scenarios, the models may each answer the question and reach a consensus or each model is specialized to answer different domain questions. However, most prior work dealing with Multi-LLM QA has focused on scenarios where the models are asked in a zero-shot manner or are given information sources to extract the answer. For question answering of an unknown environment, embodied exploration of the environment is first needed to answer the question. This skill is necessary for personalizing embodied AI to environments such as households. There is a lack of insight into whether a Multi-LLM system can handle question-answering based on observations from embodied exploration. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the use of Multi-Embodied LLM Explorers (MELE) for QA in an unknown environment. Multiple LLM-based agents independently explore and then answer queries about a household environment. We analyze different aggregation methods to generate a single, final answer for each query: debating, majority voting, and training a central answer module (CAM). Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher accuracy compared against the other non-learning-based aggregation methods. We provide code and the query dataset for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, prior methods are limited by the requirement for a large number of labeled molecules and their restricted ability to generalize for unseen and new tasks, both of which are essential for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present MolecularGPT for few-shot MPP. From a perspective on instruction tuning, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) based on curated molecular instructions spanning over 1000 property prediction tasks. This enables building a versatile and specialized LLM that can be adapted to novel MPP tasks without any fine-tuning through zero- and few-shot in-context learning (ICL). MolecularGPT exhibits competitive in-context reasoning capabilities across 10 downstream evaluation datasets, setting new benchmarks for few-shot molecular prediction tasks. More importantly, with just two-shot examples, MolecularGPT can outperform standard supervised graph neural network methods on 4 out of 7 datasets. It also excels state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 15.7% increase on classification accuracy and decrease of 17.9 on regression metrics (e.g., RMSE) under zero-shot. This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs as effective few-shot molecular property predictors. The code is available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/MolecularGPT.</p></details> |  |

However, it is difficult for readers to quickly interpret such data-involved texts and gain deep insights. To fill this research gap, this work aims to automatically generate charts to accurately convey the underlying data and ideas to readers, which is essentially a challenging task. The challenges originate from text ambiguities, intrinsic sparsity and uncertainty of data in text documents, and subjective sentiment differences. Specifically, we propose ChartifyText, a novel fully-automated approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert complex data-involved texts to expressive charts. It consists of two major modules: tabular data inference and expressive chart generation. The tabular data inference module employs systematic prompt engineering to guide the LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to infer table data, where data ranges, uncertainties, missing data values and corresponding subjective sentiments are explicitly considered. The expressive chart generation module augments standard charts with intuitive visual encodings and concise texts to accurately convey the underlying data and insights. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of ChartifyText on real-world data-involved text documents through case studies, in-depth interviews with three visualization experts, and a carefully-designed user study with 15 participants. The results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of ChartifyText in helping readers efficiently and effectively make sense of data-involved texts.</p></details> |  |

LLM Secure Code Generation by Natural Language Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14321v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in code generation, making them increasingly important in the field. However, the security issues of generated code have not been fully addressed, and the usability of LLMs in code generation still requires further exploration. This work introduces SecCode, a framework that leverages an innovative interactive encouragement prompting (EP) technique for secure code generation with \textit{only NL} prompts. This approach ensures that the prompts can be easily shared and understood by general users. SecCode functions through three stages: 1) Code Generation using NL Prompts; 2) Code Vulnerability Detection and Fixing, utilising our proposed encouragement prompting; 3) Vulnerability Cross-Checking and Code Security Refinement. These stages are executed in multiple interactive iterations to progressively enhance security. By using both proprietary LLMs (i.e., GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 and GPT-4o) and open-source LLMs (i.e., Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, DeepSeek Coder V2 Lite Instruct) evaluated on three benchmark datasets, extensive experimental results show that our proposed SecCode greatly outperforms compared baselines, generating secure code with a high vulnerability correction rate. For example, SecCode exhibits a high fix success rate of over 76\% after running 5 automated EP interactive iterations and over 89\% after running 10 automated EP interactive iterations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to formulate secure code generation with NL prompts only. We have open-sourced our code and encourage the community to focus on secure code generation.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, it struggles to capture all the necessary knowledge for complex reasoning questions. Existing retrieval methods typically divide reference documents into passages, treating them in isolation. These passages, however, are often interrelated, such as passages that are contiguous or share the same keywords. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize such relatedness for enhancing the retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval method, called GNN-Ret, which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance retrieval by exploiting the relatedness between passages. Specifically, we first construct a graph of passages by connecting passages that are structure-related or keyword-related. A graph neural network (GNN) is then leveraged to exploit the relationships between passages and improve the retrieval of supporting passages. Furthermore, we extend our method to handle multi-hop reasoning questions using a recurrent graph neural network (RGNN), named RGNN-Ret. At each step, RGNN-Ret integrates the graphs of passages from previous steps, thereby enhancing the retrieval of supporting passages. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNN-Ret achieves higher accuracy for question answering with a single query of LLMs than strong baselines that require multiple queries, and RGNN-Ret further improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 10.4% accuracy improvement on the 2WikiMQA dataset.</p></details> | Under review |

Nevertheless, handling the complex and diverse degradations encountered in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network. In the fine-tuning stage, we refine the pre-trained IR network using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Built upon a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, LoRA-IR dynamically integrates multiple low-rank restoration experts through a degradation-guided router. This dynamic integration mechanism significantly enhances our model's adaptability to diverse and unknown degradations in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 image restoration tasks and 29 benchmarks.

In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level. Related source codes and pre-trained parameters were public in https://github.com/puppy210/DaLPSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on All-in-One Image Restoration: Taxonomy, Evaluation and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15067v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) refers to the process of improving visual quality of images while removing degradation, such as noise, blur, weather effects, and so on. Traditional IR methods typically target specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance both convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this review, we delve into the AiOIR methodologies, emphasizing their architecture innovations and learning paradigm and offering a systematic review of prevalent approaches. We systematically categorize prevalent approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to advance this dynamic field. Our paper begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of cutting-edge designs based on factors such as prior knowledge and generalization capability. Next, we highlight key advancements in AiOIR, aiming to inspire further inquiry and innovation within the community. To facilitate a robust evaluation of existing methods, we collate and summarize commonly used datasets, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present an objective comparison of open-sourced methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners alike. This paper stands as the first comprehensive and insightful review of AiOIR. A related repository is available at https://github.com/Harbinzzy/All-in-One-Image-Restoration-Survey.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter Efficient Adaptation for Image Restoration with Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08881v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing single-task image restoration models for specific degradation has seen great success in recent years. To achieve generalized image restoration, all-in-one methods have recently been proposed and shown potential for multiple restoration tasks using one single model. Despite the promising results, the existing all-in-one paradigm still suffers from high computational costs as well as limited generalization on unseen degradations. In this work, we introduce an alternative solution to improve the generalization of image restoration models. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), we aim to tune only a small number of parameters to adapt pre-trained restoration models to various tasks. However, current PETL methods fail to generalize across varied restoration tasks due to their homogeneous representation nature. To this end, we propose AdaptIR, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with orthogonal multi-branch design to capture local spatial, global spatial, and channel representation bases, followed by adaptive base combination to obtain heterogeneous representation for different degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AdaptIR achieves stable performance on single-degradation tasks, and excels in hybrid-degradation tasks, with fine-tuning only 0.6% parameters for 8 hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Deep learning-based image restoration has emerged as a promising solution capable of generating high-resolution and motion-artifact-free MRI images from low-resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition times or from motion-artifact-corrupted images. To facilitate clinical integration, a time- and GPU-efficient network with reliable accuracy is essential. In this study, we adopted a unified 2D deep learning framework for pseudo-3D MRI image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) and motion artifact reduction (MAR). The optimal down-sampling factors to optimize the acquisition time in SRR were identified. Training for MAR was performed using publicly available in vivo data, employing a novel standardized method to induce motion artifacts of varying severity in a controlled way. The accuracy of the network was evaluated through a pixel-wise uncertainty map, and performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrated that the down-sampling factor of 1x1x2 for x2 acceleration and 2x2x2 for x4 acceleration was optimal. For SRR, the proposed TS-RCAN outperformed the 3D networks of mDCSRN and ReCNN, with an improvement of more than 0.01 in SSIM and 1.5 dB in PSNR while reducing GPU load by up to and inference time by up to 90%. For MAR, TS-RCAN exceeded UNet's performance by up to 0.014 in SSIM and 1.48 dB in PSNR. Additionally, TS-RCAN provided uncertainty information, which can be used to estimate the quality of the reconstructed images. TS-RCAN has potential use for SRR and MAR in the clinical setting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fusion from Decomposition: A Self-Supervised Approach for Image Fusion and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12274v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion is famous as an alternative solution to generate one high-quality image from multiple images in addition to image restoration from a single degraded image. The essence of image fusion is to integrate complementary information from source images. Existing fusion methods struggle with generalization across various tasks and often require labor-intensive designs, in which it is difficult to identify and extract useful information from source images due to the diverse requirements of each fusion task. Additionally, these methods develop highly specialized features for different downstream applications, hindering the adaptation to new and diverse downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFusion++, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to enhance the versatility of feature representation for different image fusion tasks. DeFusion++ captures the image fusion task-friendly representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way, overcoming the constraints of limited fusion datasets. Specifically, we introduce two innovative pretext tasks: common and unique decomposition (CUD) and masked feature modeling (MFM). CUD decomposes source images into abstract common and unique components, while MFM refines these components into robust fused features. Jointly training of these tasks enables DeFusion++ to produce adaptable representations that can effectively extract useful information from various source images, regardless of the fusion task. The resulting fused representations are also highly adaptable for a wide range of downstream tasks, including image segmentation and object detection. DeFusion++ stands out by producing versatile fused representations that can enhance both the quality of image fusion and the effectiveness of downstream high-level vision tasks, simplifying the process with the elegant fusion framework.</p></details> | 18page |
| **[Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration: New Benchmarks and A Dual Interaction Prior-Driven Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13607v4)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration has acquired remarkable attention due to its practical demand. In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, dehazing, deblurring, desonwing, and deraining. The source codes and benchmarks are available at \url{https://github.com/wlydlut/UHDDIP}.</p></details> |  |

However, efforts to extend these advancements to video scenarios have been minimal, partly because of the absence of benchmarks that allow for a comprehensive and fair comparison. In this work, we first present a fair evaluation benchmark, in which we first introduce a Real-world Low-Quality Face Video benchmark (RFV-LQ), evaluate several leading image-based face restoration algorithms, and conduct a thorough systematical analysis of the benefits and challenges associated with extending blind face image restoration algorithms to degraded face videos. Our analysis identifies several key issues, primarily categorized into two aspects: significant jitters in facial components and noise-shape flickering between frames. To address these issues, we propose a Temporal Consistency Network (TCN) cooperated with alignment smoothing to reduce jitters and flickers in restored videos. TCN is a flexible component that can be seamlessly plugged into the most advanced face image restoration algorithms, ensuring the quality of image-based restoration is maintained as closely as possible. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed TCN and alignment smoothing operation.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various unknown degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different types of degradation, forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration plug-and-play method that generates parameters based on the input image and thus makes the model to adapt to specific degradation dynamically. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and All-in-One settings. Notably, our proposed model Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve a given small enough error, our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to mainstream embedding-based All-in-One methods.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate the versatility of DDR as an image descriptor, with strong correlations observed with key image attributes such as complexity, colorfulness, sharpness, and overall quality. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of DDR across a spectrum of applications. It excels as a blind image quality assessment metric, outperforming existing methodologies across multiple datasets.

However, existing restoration backbones often face the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation, hindering their application in practice. Recently, the Selective Structured State Space Model, especially the improved version Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a way to resolve the above dilemma. However, the standard Mamba still faces certain challenges in low-level vision such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In this work, we introduce a simple but effective baseline, named MambaIR, which introduces both local enhancement and channel attention to improve the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of the local pixel similarity and reduces the channel redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms SwinIR by up to 0.45dB on image SR, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field.

| **[A Preliminary Exploration Towards General Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15143v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the tremendous success of deep models in various individual image restoration tasks, there are at least two major technical challenges preventing these works from being applied to real-world usages: (1) the lack of generalization ability and (2) the complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing deep models, tailored for specific individual image restoration tasks, often fall short in effectively addressing these challenges. In this paper, we present a new problem called general image restoration (GIR) which aims to address these challenges within a unified model. GIR covers most individual image restoration tasks (\eg, image denoising, deblurring, deraining and super-resolution) and their combinations for general purposes. This paper proceeds to delineate the essential aspects of GIR, including problem definition and the overarching significance of generalization performance. Moreover, the establishment of new datasets and a thorough evaluation framework for GIR models is discussed. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing approaches for tackling the GIR challenge, illuminating their strengths and pragmatic challenges. By analyzing these approaches, we not only underscore the effectiveness of GIR but also highlight the difficulties in its practical implementation. At last, we also try to understand and interpret these models' behaviors to inspire the future direction. Our work can open up new valuable research directions and contribute to the research of general vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Pre-training: Towards Efficient and Scalable All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02154v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-in-one image restoration tackles different types of degradations with a unified model instead of having task-specific, non-generic models for each degradation. The requirement to tackle multiple degradations using the same model can lead to high-complexity designs with fixed configuration that lack the adaptability to more efficient alternatives. We propose DyNet, a dynamic family of networks designed in an encoder-decoder style for all-in-one image restoration tasks. Our DyNet can seamlessly switch between its bulkier and lightweight variants, thereby offering flexibility for efficient model deployment with a single round of training. This seamless switching is enabled by our weights-sharing mechanism, forming the core of our architecture and facilitating the reuse of initialized module weights. Further, to establish robust weights initialization, we introduce a dynamic pre-training strategy that trains variants of the proposed DyNet concurrently, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GPU hours. Our dynamic pre-training strategy eliminates the need for maintaining separate checkpoints for each variant, as all models share a common set of checkpoints, varying only in model depth. This efficient strategy significantly reduces storage overhead and enhances adaptability. To tackle the unavailability of large-scale dataset required in pre-training, we curate a high-quality, high-resolution image dataset named Million-IRD, having 2M image samples. We validate our DyNet for image denoising, deraining, and dehazing in all-in-one setting, achieving state-of-the-art results with 31.34\% reduction in GFlops and a 56.75\% reduction in parameters compared to baseline models. The source codes and trained models are available at https://github.com/akshaydudhane16/DyNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes updates where the DyNet variants now share the same weights during inference as well, eliminating the need to store separate weights and thereby reducing device storage requirements.

| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image restoration algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08688v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite previous works typically targeting isolated degradation types, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations which involve a complex interplay of multiple different isolated degradations. Recognizing the challenges posed by the exponential number of possible degradation combinations, we propose Universal Image Restoration (UIR), a new task setting that requires models to be trained on a set of degradation bases and then remove any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought which prompts LLMs to address problems step-by-step, we propose the Chain-of-Restoration (CoR), which instructs models to step-by-step remove unknown composite degradations. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR significantly improves model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving results comparable to or surpassing those of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations. The code will be released at https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Existing methods achieve remarkable results for addressing single-weather conditions. However, they face challenges when encountering unpredictable weather conditions, which often happen in real-world scenarios. Although different weather conditions exhibit different degradation patterns, they share common characteristics that are highly related and complementary, such as occlusions caused by degradation patterns, color distortion, and contrast attenuation due to the scattering of atmospheric particles. Therefore, we focus on leveraging common knowledge across multiple weather conditions to restore images in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose a Triplet Attention Network (TANet) to efficiently and effectively address all-in-one adverse weather image restoration. TANet consists of Triplet Attention Block (TAB) that incorporates three types of attention mechanisms: Local Pixel-wise Attention (LPA) and Global Strip-wise Attention (GSA) to address occlusions caused by non-uniform degradation patterns, and Global Distribution Attention (GDA) to address color distortion and contrast attenuation caused by atmospheric phenomena. By leveraging common knowledge shared across different weather conditions, TANet successfully addresses multiple weather conditions in a unified manner. Experimental results show that TANet efficiently and effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance in all-in-one adverse weather image restoration.

Despite the impressive results achieved by these I2I models, their practical utility is hampered by their large model size and the computational burden of the iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel compression method tailored for diffusion-based I2I models. Based on the observations that the image conditions of I2I models already provide rich information on image structures, and that the time steps with a larger impact tend to be biased, we develop surprisingly simple yet effective approaches for reducing the model size and latency. We validate the effectiveness of our method on three representative I2I tasks: InstructPix2Pix for image editing, StableSR for image restoration, and ControlNet for image-conditional image generation. Our approach achieves satisfactory output quality with 39.2%, 56.4% and 39.2% reduction in model footprint, as well as 81.4%, 68.7% and 31.1% decrease in latency to InstructPix2Pix, StableSR and ControlNet, respectively.</p></details> | ACCV 2024 |

An effective strategy is to incorporate prior knowledge, either from human input or generative model. In this paper, we introduce Instant-reference Image Restoration (InstantIR), a novel diffusion-based BIR method which dynamically adjusts generation condition during inference. We first extract a compact representation of the input via a pre-trained vision encoder. At each generation step, this representation is used to decode current diffusion latent and instantiate it in the generative prior. The degraded image is then encoded with this reference, providing robust generation condition. We observe the variance of generative references fluctuate with degradation intensity, which we further leverage as an indicator for developing a sampling algorithm adaptive to input quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate InstantIR achieves state-of-the-art performance and offering outstanding visual quality. Through modulating generative references with textual description, InstantIR can restore extreme degradation and additionally feature creative restoration.</p></details> |  |

Despite the outstanding performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted the application of image restoration. To lift the restriction, it is required to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning approaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint. However, it fails to account for different computational complexities and performance requirements for different layers of an image restoration network. To further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the restoration accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method which outperforms previous pruning methods significantly.

However, existing LRMs often suffer from the hallucination dilemma, i.e., producing incorrect contents or textures when dealing with severe degradations, due to their heavy reliance on limited internal knowledge. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal solution called the Retrieval-augmented Framework for Image Restoration (ReFIR), which incorporates retrieved images as external knowledge to extend the knowledge boundary of existing LRMs in generating details faithful to the original scene. Specifically, we first introduce the nearest neighbor lookup to retrieve content-relevant high-quality images as reference, after which we propose the cross-image injection to modify existing LRMs to utilize high-quality textures from retrieved images. Thanks to the additional external knowledge, our ReFIR can well handle the hallucination challenge and facilitate faithfully results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFIR can achieve not only high-fidelity but also realistic restoration results. Importantly, our ReFIR requires no training and is adaptable to various LRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the significant superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

| **[SITCOM: Step-wise Triple-Consistent Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04479v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative models that allow sampling from a distribution learned over a training set. When applied to solving inverse imaging problems (IPs), the reverse sampling steps of DMs are typically modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution in the image space. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (such as in the presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier sampling steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces the standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions, either implicitly or explicitly, our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our accelerated method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, under different levels of measurement noise, our extensive experiments across five linear and three non-linear image restoration tasks demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard image similarity metrics while requiring a significantly reduced run-time across all considered tasks.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we tackle a variety of vision tasks into a unified image-text-to-image generation framework and curate an Omni Pixel-to-Pixel Instruction-Tuning Dataset. By constructing detailed instruction templates in natural language, we comprehensively include a large set of diverse vision tasks such as text-to-image generation, image restoration, image grounding, dense image prediction, image editing, controllable generation, inpainting/outpainting, and more. Furthermore, we adopt Diffusion Transformers (DiT) as our foundation model and extend its capabilities with a flexible any resolution mechanism, enabling the model to dynamically process images based on the aspect ratio of the input, closely aligning with human perceptual processes.

Leveraging a blend of attribute text prompts, high-quality reference images, and identity information, MGFR can mitigate the generation of false facial attributes and identities often associated with generative face restoration methods. By incorporating a dual-control adapter and a two-stage training strategy, our method effectively utilizes multi-modal prior information for targeted restoration tasks. We also present the Reface-HQ dataset, comprising over 23,000 high-resolution facial images across 5,000 identities, to address the need for reference face training images. Our approach achieves superior visual quality in restoring facial details under severe degradation and allows for controlled restoration processes, enhancing the accuracy of identity preservation and attribute correction. Including negative quality samples and attribute prompts in the training further refines the model's ability to generate detailed and perceptually accurate images.</p></details> | 23 Pages, 28 Figures |

We consider the setting where the rank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a priori and use an objective function built from a rank-overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground truth. We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the rank of the ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix rank, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when it is stopped appropriately. We then propose an efficient stopping strategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects a nearly optimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with deep image prior, which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900v3)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility.

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

| **[Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03463v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint. under review.

| **[Denoising as Adaptation: Noise-Space Domain Adaptation for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18516v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although learning-based image restoration methods have made significant progress, they still struggle with limited generalization to real-world scenarios due to the substantial domain gap caused by training on synthetic data. Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://kangliao929.github.io/projects/noise-da/</p></details> |

Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking. In this paper, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from technical details to applications. We highlight the major advancements in deep learning-based single-image shadow removal methods, thoroughly review previous research across various categories, and provide insights into the historical progression of these developments. Additionally, we summarize performance comparisons both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond the technical aspects of shadow removal methods, we also explore potential future directions for this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>url: ...</summary><p>url: https://github.com/GuoLanqing/Awesome-Shadow-Removal</p></details> |
| **[TransRef: Multi-Scale Reference Embedding Transformer for Reference-Guided Image Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11528v3)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image inpainting for completing complicated semantic environments and diverse hole patterns of corrupted images is challenging even for state-of-the-art learning-based inpainting methods trained on large-scale data. A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking and Defending Protective Perturbation in Personalized Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18944v4)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized diffusion models (PDMs) have become prominent for adapting pretrained text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects using minimal training data. However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted datasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective perturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification methods attempt to mitigate this issue but often over-purify images, resulting in information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a latent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP embedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate noisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor generalization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic defense framework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning. We first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images with their original semantic meanings in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of personalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers fundamental shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its superiority over existing purification methods and stronger robustness against adaptive perturbation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/liuyixin-louis/DiffShortcut</p></details> |
| **[Posterior sampling via Langevin dynamics based on generative priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02078v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Posterior sampling in high-dimensional spaces using generative models holds significant promise for various applications, including but not limited to inverse problems and guided generation tasks. Despite many recent developments, generating diverse posterior samples remains a challenge, as existing methods require restarting the entire generative process for each new sample, making the procedure computationally expensive. In this work, we propose efficient posterior sampling by simulating Langevin dynamics in the noise space of a pre-trained generative model. By exploiting the mapping between the noise and data spaces which can be provided by distilled flows or consistency models, our method enables seamless exploration of the posterior without the need to re-run the full sampling chain, drastically reducing computational overhead. Theoretically, we prove a guarantee for the proposed noise-space Langevin dynamics to approximate the posterior, assuming that the generative model sufficiently approximates the prior distribution. Our framework is experimentally validated on image restoration tasks involving noisy linear and nonlinear forward operators applied to LSUN-Bedroom (256 x 256) and ImageNet (64 x 64) datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach generates high-fidelity samples with enhanced semantic diversity even under a limited number of function evaluations, offering superior efficiency and performance compared to existing diffusion-based posterior sampling techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00418v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods typically attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

Currently, CNN-transformer hybrid models provide state-of-the-art performance for these tasks. The key common ingredient in the architectural designs of these models is Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). We first show that CSA is an overall low-rank operation. Then, we propose an instance-Guided Low-rank Multi-Head selfattention (GLMHA) to replace the CSA for a considerable computational gain while closely retaining the original model performance. Unique to the proposed GLMHA is its ability to provide computational gain for both short and long input sequences. In particular, the gain is in terms of both Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and parameter count reduction. This is in contrast to the existing popular computational complexity reduction techniques, e.g., Linformer, Performer, and Reformer, for whom FLOPs overpower the efficient design tricks for the shorter input sequences. Moreover, parameter reduction remains unaccounted for in the existing methods.We perform an extensive evaluation for the tasks of spectral reconstruction from RGB images, spectral reconstruction from snapshot compressive imaging, motion deblurring, and image deraining by enhancing the best-performing models with our GLMHA. Our results show up to a 7.7 Giga FLOPs reduction with 370K fewer parameters required to closely retain the original performance of the best-performing models that employ CSA.</p></details> |  |

Despite performing effectively compared to single degradation restoration methods, they overlook the utilization of commonalities and specificities within multi-task restoration, thereby impeding the model's performance. Inspired by the success of deep generative models and fine-tuning techniques, we proposed a universal image restoration framework based on multiple low-rank adapters (LoRA) from multi-domain transfer learning. Our framework leverages the pre-trained generative model as the shared component for multi-degradation restoration and transfers it to specific degradation image restoration tasks using low-rank adaptation. Additionally, we introduce a LoRA composing strategy based on the degradation similarity, which adaptively combines trained LoRAs and enables our model to be applicable for mixed degradation restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple and mixed degradations demonstrate that the proposed universal image restoration method not only achieves higher fidelity and perceptual image quality but also has better generalization ability than other unified image restoration models.

However, these approaches often incur substantial memory requirements, particularly when processing ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. In this paper, we propose a novel image restoration method called MixNet, which introduces an alternative approach to global modeling approaches and is more effective for UHD image restoration. To capture the longrange dependency of features without introducing excessive computational complexity, we present the Global Feature Modulation Layer (GFML). GFML associates features from different views by permuting the feature maps, enabling efficient modeling of long-range dependency. In addition, we also design the Local Feature Modulation Layer (LFML) and Feed-forward Layer (FFL) to capture local features and transform features into a compact representation. This way, our MixNetachieves effective restoration with low inference time overhead and computational complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on four UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, underwater image enhancement, image deblurring and image demoireing, and the comprehensive results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a simple pipeline for all-in-one blind image restoration to Restore Anything with Masks (RAM). We focus on the image content by utilizing Mask Image Modeling to extract intrinsic image information rather than distinguishing degradation types like other methods. Our pipeline consists of two stages: masked image pre-training and fine-tuning with mask attribute conductance. We design a straightforward masking pre-training approach specifically tailored for all-in-one image restoration. This approach enhances networks to prioritize the extraction of image content priors from various degradations, resulting in a more balanced performance across different restoration tasks and achieving stronger overall results. To bridge the gap of input integrity while preserving learned image priors as much as possible, we selectively fine-tuned a small portion of the layers. Specifically, the importance of each layer is ranked by the proposed Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC), and the layers with higher contributions are selected for finetuning.

The Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) presents a promising alternative by starting the generative process from corrupted images and leveraging training techniques from score-based diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce the Implicit Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^3$SB) to further accelerate the generative process of I$^2$SB. I$^3$SB reconfigures the generative process into a non-Markovian framework by incorporating the initial corrupted image into each step, while ensuring that the marginal distribution aligns with that of I$^2$SB. This allows for the direct use of the pretrained network from I$^2$SB. Extensive experiments on natural images, human face images, and medical images validate the acceleration benefits of I$^3$SB.

However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps.

However, existing methods tend to degrade on double JPEG images, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for double JPEG artifacts removal, termed as OAPT. We conduct an analysis of double JPEG compression that results in up to four patterns within each 8x8 block and design our model to cluster the similar patterns to remedy the difficulty of restoration. Our OAPT consists of two components: compression offset predictor and image reconstructor. Specifically, the predictor estimates pixel offsets between the first and second compression, which are then utilized to divide different patterns. The reconstructor is mainly based on several Hybrid Partition Attention Blocks (HPAB), combining vanilla window-based self-attention and sparse attention for clustered pattern features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OAPT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 0.16dB in double JPEG image restoration task. Moreover, without increasing any computation cost, the pattern clustering module in HPAB can serve as a plugin to enhance other transformer-based image restoration methods.

Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases. In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation. This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks. We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively. Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement.

| **[Lightweight single-image super-resolution network based on dual paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06590v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The single image super-resolution(SISR) algorithms under deep learning currently have two main models, one based on convolutional neural networks and the other based on Transformer. The former uses the stacking of convolutional layers with different convolutional kernel sizes to design the model, which enables the model to better extract the local features of the image; the latter uses the self-attention mechanism to design the model, which allows the model to establish long-distance dependencies between image pixel points through the self-attention mechanism and then better extract the global features of the image. However, both of the above methods face their problems. Based on this, this paper proposes a new lightweight multi-scale feature fusion network model based on two-way complementary convolutional and Transformer, which integrates the respective features of Transformer and convolutional neural networks through a two-branch network architecture, to realize the mutual fusion of global and local information. Meanwhile, considering the partial loss of information caused by the low-pixel images trained by the deep neural network, this paper designs a modular connection method of multi-stage feature supplementation to fuse the feature maps extracted from the shallow stage of the model with those extracted from the deep stage of the model, to minimize the loss of the information in the feature images that is beneficial to the image restoration as much as possible, to facilitate the obtaining of a higher-quality restored image. The practical results finally show that the model proposed in this paper is optimal in image recovery performance when compared with other lightweight models with the same amount of parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perception-Distortion Balanced Super-Resolution: A Multi-Objective Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15408v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High perceptual quality and low distortion degree are two important goals in image restoration tasks such as super-resolution (SR). Most of the existing SR methods aim to achieve these goals by minimizing the corresponding yet conflicting losses, such as the $\ell_1$ loss and the adversarial loss. Unfortunately, the commonly used gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, are hard to balance these objectives due to the opposite gradient decent directions of the contradictory losses. In this paper, we formulate the perception-distortion trade-off in SR as a multi-objective optimization problem and develop a new optimizer by integrating the gradient-free evolutionary algorithm (EA) with gradient-based Adam, where EA and Adam focus on the divergence and convergence of the optimization directions respectively. As a result, a population of optimal models with different perception-distortion preferences is obtained. We then design a fusion network to merge these models into a single stronger one for an effective perception-distortion trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that with the same backbone network, the perception-distortion balanced SR model trained by our method can achieve better perceptual quality than its competitors while attaining better reconstruction fidelity.

| **[Graph Image Prior for Unsupervised Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15770v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can be a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The conclusion about reconstruction performance with the size of the latent variable is not stable, we must validate it before presenting it to other researchers</p></details> |
| **[One-Shot Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17426v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration, or inverse problems in image processing, has long been an extensively studied topic. In recent years supervised learning approaches have become a popular strategy attempting to tackle this task. Unfortunately, most supervised learning-based methods are highly demanding in terms of computational resources and training data (sample complexity). In addition, trained models are sensitive to domain changes, such as varying acquisition systems, signal sampling rates, resolution and contrast. In this work, we try to answer a fundamental question: Can supervised learning models generalize well solely by learning from one image or even part of an image? If so, then what is the minimal amount of patches required to achieve acceptable generalization? To this end, we focus on an efficient patch-based learning framework that requires a single image input-output pair for training. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach for supervised image deblurring and super-resolution. Our results showcase significant improvement of learning models' sample efficiency, generalization and time complexity, that can hopefully be leveraged for future real-time applications, and applied to other signals and modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.14267</p></details> |
| **[Dequantization and Color Transfer with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02698v4)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate an image dequantizing diffusion model that enables novel image edits on natural images. We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally, the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly, while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784v2)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation to develop empirically effective algorithms for image restoration. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments over multiple datasets across several restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Efficient Diffusion Model for Image Restoration by Residual Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07319v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods have achieved remarkable success, they are still limited by the low inference speed attributed to the necessity of executing hundreds or even thousands of sampling steps. Existing acceleration sampling techniques, though seeking to expedite the process, inevitably sacrifice performance to some extent, resulting in over-blurry restored outcomes. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on three classical IR tasks, namely image super-resolution, image inpainting, and blind face restoration, \textit{\textbf{even only with four sampling steps}}.

| **[Variational Bayes image restoration with compressive autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17744v3)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling.Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, they often overlook the correlation between these channels, leading to color distortion and artifacts in the reconstructed image. To address this, we present Quaternion Nuclear Norm Minus Frobenius Norm Minimization (QNMF), a novel approach for color image reconstruction. QNMF utilizes quaternion algebra to capture the relationships among RGB channels comprehensively. By employing a regularization technique that involves nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm, QNMF approximates the underlying low-rank structure of quaternion-encoded color images. Theoretical proofs are provided to ensure the method's mathematical integrity. Demonstrating versatility and efficacy, the QNMF regularizer excels in various color low-level vision tasks, including denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and random impulse noise removal, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by Pattern Recognition on September 5, 2024</p></details> |
| **[In-Loop Filtering via Trained Look-Up Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10926v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology for removing the artifacts in image/video coding standards. Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[PanAdapter: Two-Stage Fine-Tuning with Spatial-Spectral Priors Injecting for Pansharpening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06980v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pansharpening is a challenging image fusion task that involves restoring images using two different modalities: low-resolution multispectral images (LRMS) and high-resolution panchromatic (PAN). Many end-to-end specialized models based on deep learning (DL) have been proposed, yet the scale and performance of these models are limited by the size of dataset. Given the superior parameter scales and feature representations of pre-trained models, they exhibit outstanding performance when transferred to downstream tasks with small datasets. Therefore, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method, namely PanAdapter, which utilizes additional advanced semantic information from pre-trained models to alleviate the issue of small-scale datasets in pansharpening tasks. Specifically, targeting the large domain discrepancy between image restoration and pansharpening tasks, the PanAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy for progressively adapting to the downstream task. In the first stage, we fine-tune the pre-trained CNN model and extract task-specific priors at two scales by proposed Local Prior Extraction (LPE) module. In the second stage, we feed the extracted two-scale priors into two branches of cascaded adapters respectively. At each adapter, we design two parameter-efficient modules for allowing the two branches to interact and be injected into the frozen pre-trained VisionTransformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that by only training the proposed LPE modules and adapters with a small number of parameters, our approach can benefit from pre-trained image restoration models and achieve state-of-the-art performance in several benchmark pansharpening datasets. The code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Weather Image Restoration via Histogram-Based Transformer Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06334v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, the mainstream restoration tasks under adverse weather conditions have predominantly focused on single-weather scenarios. However, in reality, multiple weather conditions always coexist and their degree of mixing is usually unknown. Under such complex and diverse weather conditions, single-weather restoration models struggle to meet practical demands. This is particularly critical in fields such as autonomous driving, where there is an urgent need for a model capable of effectively handling mixed weather conditions and enhancing image quality in an automated manner. In this paper, we propose a Task Sequence Generator module that, in conjunction with the Task Intra-patch Block, effectively extracts task-specific features embedded in degraded images. The Task Intra-patch Block introduces an external learnable sequence that aids the network in capturing task-specific information. Additionally, we employ a histogram-based transformer module as the backbone of our network, enabling the capture of both global and local dynamic range features. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.03249</p></details> |

Nevertheless, most of transformer-based models are strictly bounded by exorbitant memory occupancy. Our goal is to reduce the memory consumption of Swin Transformer and at the same time speed up the model during training process. Thus, we introduce AgileIR, group shifted attention mechanism along with window attention, which sparsely simplifies the model in architecture. We propose Group Shifted Window Attention (GSWA) to decompose Shift Window Multi-head Self Attention (SW-MSA) and Window Multi-head Self Attention (W-MSA) into groups across their attention heads, contributing to shrinking memory usage in back propagation. In addition to that, we keep shifted window masking and its shifted learnable biases during training, in order to induce the model interacting across windows within the channel. We also re-allocate projection parameters to accelerate attention matrix calculation, which we found a negligible decrease in performance. As a result of experiment, compared with our baseline SwinIR and other efficient quantization models, AgileIR keeps the performance still at 32.20 dB on Set5 evaluation dataset, exceeding other methods with tailor-made efficient methods and saves over 50% memory while a large batch size is employed.</p></details> |  |

Despite its innovative approach to seamless display integration, UDC technology faces unique image degradation challenges exacerbated by the susceptibility to adversarial perturbations. Our research initially conducts an in-depth robustness evaluation of deep-learning-based UDC image restoration models by employing several white-box and black-box attacking methods. This evaluation is pivotal in understanding the vulnerabilities of current UDC image restoration techniques. Following the assessment, we introduce a defense framework integrating adversarial purification with subsequent fine-tuning processes. First, our approach employs diffusion-based adversarial purification, effectively neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Then, we apply the fine-tuning methodologies to refine the image restoration models further, ensuring that the quality and fidelity of the restored images are maintained. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments, showing marked improvements in resilience against typical adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

PLAI is completed by accurately detecting the electrical components and defects in the aerial images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the visible quality of aerial images is inevitably degraded by adverse weather like haze, rain, or snow, which are found to drastically decrease the detection accuracy in our research. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new task of Power Line Aerial Image Restoration under Adverse Weather (PLAIR-AW), which aims to recover clean and high-quality images from degraded images with bad weather thus improving detection performance for PLAI. In this context, we are the first to release numerous corresponding datasets, namely, HazeCPLID, HazeTTPLA, HazeInsPLAD for power line aerial image dehazing, RainCPLID, RainTTPLA, RainInsPLAD for power line aerial image deraining, SnowCPLID, SnowInsPLAD for power line aerial image desnowing, which are synthesized upon the public power line aerial image datasets of CPLID, TTPLA, InsPLAD following the mathematical models. Meanwhile, we select numerous state-of-the-art methods from image restoration community as the baseline methods for PLAIR-AW. At last, we conduct large-scale empirical experiments to evaluate the performance of baseline methods on the proposed datasets.

| **[Empirical Bayesian image restoration by Langevin sampling with a denoising diffusion implicit prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04384v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion methods provide a powerful strategy to solve image restoration tasks by flexibly combining a pre-trained foundational prior model with a likelihood function specified during test time. Such methods are predominantly derived from two stochastic processes: reversing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, which underpins the celebrated denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM), and the Langevin diffusion process. The solutions delivered by DDPM and DDIM are often remarkably realistic, but they are not always consistent with measurements because of likelihood intractability issues and the associated required approximations. Alternatively, using a Langevin process circumvents the intractable likelihood issue, but usually leads to restoration results of inferior quality and longer computing times. This paper presents a novel and highly computationally efficient image restoration method that carefully embeds a foundational DDPM denoiser within an empirical Bayesian Langevin algorithm, which jointly calibrates key model hyper-parameters as it estimates the model's posterior mean. Extensive experimental results on three canonical tasks (image deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting) demonstrate that the proposed approach improves on state-of-the-art strategies both in image estimation accuracy and computing time.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Data-free distillation provides an alternative for allowing to learn a lightweight student model from a pre-trained teacher model without relying on the original training data. The existing data-free learning methods mainly optimize the models with the pseudo data generated by GANs or the real data collected from the Internet. However, they inevitably suffer from the problems of unstable training or domain shifts with the original data. In this paper, we propose a novel Data-free Distillation with Degradation-prompt Diffusion framework for multi-weather Image Restoration (D4IR). It replaces GANs with pre-trained diffusion models to avoid model collapse and incorporates a degradation-aware prompt adapter to facilitate content-driven conditional diffusion for generating domain-related images. Specifically, a contrast-based degradation prompt adapter is firstly designed to capture degradation-aware prompts from web-collected degraded images. Then, the collected unpaired clean images are perturbed to latent features of stable diffusion, and conditioned with the degradation-aware prompts to synthesize new domain-related degraded images for knowledge distillation. Experiments illustrate that our proposal achieves comparable performance to the model distilled with original training data, and is even superior to other mainstream unsupervised methods.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world weather conditions often consist of a mixture of several weather types, and the degree of weather mixing in autonomous driving scenarios remains unknown. In the presence of complex and diverse weather conditions, a single weather removal model often encounters challenges in producing clear images from severe weather images. Therefore, there is a need for the development of multi-task severe weather removal models that can effectively handle mixed weather conditions and improve image quality in autonomous driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-task severe weather removal model that can effectively handle complex weather conditions in an adaptive manner. Our model incorporates a weather task sequence generator, enabling the self-attention mechanism to selectively focus on features specific to different weather types. To tackle the challenge of repairing large areas of weather degradation, we introduce Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) to increase the receptive field. Additionally, we propose an adaptive upsampling technique that effectively processes both the weather task information and underlying image features by selectively retaining relevant information.

Conversely, using GAN or perceptual losses can produce sharp images with high perceptual metric scores (e.g., LPIPS), but may introduce artifacts and incorrect textures. Balancing these two types of losses can help achieve a trade-off between distortion and perception, but the challenge lies in tuning the loss function weights. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) into the training process of SISR models to balance perceptual quality and distortion. We conceptualize the relationship between loss weights and image quality assessment (IQA) metrics as black-box objective functions to be optimized within our Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization Super-Resolution (MOBOSR) framework. This approach automates the hyperparameter tuning process, reduces overall computational cost, and enables the use of numerous loss functions simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOBOSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both perceptual quality and distortion, significantly advancing the perception-distortion Pareto frontier. Our work points towards a new direction for future research on balancing perceptual quality and fidelity in nearly all image restoration tasks.

However, their performance is limited due to the dependency of FT on stationary signals and its lack of capability to extract spatial-frequency properties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT), a unified spatial-frequency representation leveraging both spatial and frequency components simultaneously, making it ideal for processing non-stationary signals like images. Specifically, we introduce a Fractional Fourier Transformer (F2former), where we combine the classical fractional Fourier based Wiener deconvolution (F2WD) as well as a multi-branch encoder-decoder transformer based on a new fractional frequency aware transformer block (F2TB). We design F2TB consisting of a fractional frequency aware self-attention (F2SA) to estimate element-wise product attention based on important frequency components and a novel feed-forward network based on frequency division multiplexing (FM-FFN) to refine high and low frequency features separately for efficient latent clear image restoration. Experimental results for the cases of both motion deblurring as well as defocus deblurring show that the performance of our proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Restorer: Removing Multi-Degradation with All-Axis Attention and Prompt Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12587v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many excellent solutions in image restoration.However, most methods require on training separate models to restore images with different types of degradation.Although existing all-in-one models effectively address multiple types of degradation simultaneously, their performance in real-world scenarios is still constrained by the task confusion problem.In this work, we attempt to address this issue by introducing \textbf{Restorer}, a novel Transformer-based all-in-one image restoration model.To effectively address the complex degradation present in real-world images, we propose All-Axis Attention (AAA), a mechanism that simultaneously models long-range dependencies across both spatial and channel dimensions, capturing potential correlations along all axes.Additionally, we introduce textual prompts in Restorer to incorporate explicit task priors, enabling the removal of specific degradation types based on user instructions. By iterating over these prompts, Restorer can handle composite degradation in real-world scenarios without requiring additional training.Based on these designs, Restorer with one set of parameters demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to existing all-in-one and even single-task models.Additionally, Restorer is efficient during inference, suggesting the potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing learning-based point cloud upsampling methods are constrained by computational resources and batch processing strategies, which often require subdividing point clouds into smaller patches, leading to distortions that degrade perceptual quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 2D-3D hybrid colored point cloud upsampling framework (GaussianPU) based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for robotic perception. This approach leverages 3DGS to bridge 3D point clouds with their 2D rendered images in robot vision systems. A dual scale rendered image restoration network transforms sparse point cloud renderings into dense representations, which are then input into 3DGS along with precise robot camera poses and interpolated sparse point clouds to reconstruct dense 3D point clouds. We have made a series of enhancements to the vanilla 3DGS, enabling precise control over the number of points and significantly boosting the quality of the upsampled point cloud for robotic scene understanding. Our framework supports processing entire point clouds on a single consumer-grade GPU, such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, eliminating the need for segmentation and thus producing high-quality, dense colored point clouds with millions of points for robot navigation and manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental results on generating million-level point cloud data validate the effectiveness of our method, substantially improving the quality of colored point clouds and demonstrating significant potential for applications involving large-scale point clouds in autonomous robotics and human-robot interaction scenarios.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Currently, a low-cost scheme called Machine Unlearning forgets the private data remembered in the model. Specifically, given a private dataset and a trained neural network, we need to use e.g. pruning, fine-tuning, and gradient ascent to remove the influence of the private dataset on the neural network. Inspired by this, we try to use this concept to bridge the gap between the fields of image restoration and security, creating a new research idea. We propose the scene for the All-In-One model (a neural network that restores a wide range of degraded information), where a given dataset such as haze, or rain, is private and needs to be eliminated from the influence of it on the trained model. Notably, we find great challenges in this task to remove the influence of sensitive data while ensuring that the overall model performance remains robust, which is akin to directing a symphony orchestra without specific instruments while keeping the playing soothing. Here we explore a simple but effective approach: Instance-wise Unlearning through the use of adversarial examples and gradient ascent techniques. Our approach is a low-cost solution compared to the strategy of retraining the model from scratch, where the gradient ascent trick forgets the specified data and the performance of the adversarial sample maintenance model is robust. Through extensive experimentation on two popular unified image restoration models, we show that our approach effectively preserves knowledge of remaining data while unlearning a given degradation type.</p></details> |  |

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |

Our method leverages the advantages of LoRA to fine-tune SDXL models, thereby significantly improving image restoration quality and efficiency. We collect 2600 high-quality real-world images, each with detailed descriptive text, for training the model. The proposed method is evaluated on standard benchmarks and achieves excellent performance, demonstrated by higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), lower learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and higher structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) scores. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining LoRA with SDXL for advanced image restoration tasks, highlighting the potential of our approach in generating high-fidelity restored images.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[GameIR: A Large-Scale Synthesized Ground-Truth Dataset for Image Restoration over Gaming Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16866v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration methods like super-resolution and image synthesis have been successfully used in commercial cloud gaming products like NVIDIA's DLSS. However, restoration over gaming content is not well studied by the general public. The discrepancy is mainly caused by the lack of ground-truth gaming training data that match the test cases. Due to the unique characteristics of gaming content, the common approach of generating pseudo training data by degrading the original HR images results in inferior restoration performance. In this work, we develop GameIR, a large-scale high-quality computer-synthesized ground-truth dataset to fill in the blanks, targeting at two different applications. The first is super-resolution with deferred rendering, to support the gaming solution of rendering and transferring LR images only and restoring HR images on the client side. We provide 19200 LR-HR paired ground-truth frames coming from 640 videos rendered at 720p and 1440p for this task. The second is novel view synthesis (NVS), to support the multiview gaming solution of rendering and transferring part of the multiview frames and generating the remaining frames on the client side. This task has 57,600 HR frames from 960 videos of 160 scenes with 6 camera views. In addition to the RGB frames, the GBuffers during the deferred rendering stage are also provided, which can be used to help restoration. Furthermore, we evaluate several SOTA super-resolution algorithms and NeRF-based NVS algorithms over our dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our ground-truth GameIR data in improving restoration performance for gaming content. Also, we test the method of incorporating the GBuffers as additional input information for helping super-resolution and NVS. We release our dataset and models to the general public to facilitate research on restoration methods over gaming content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Control for Diffusion Bridge in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16303v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration refers to the process of restoring a damaged low-quality image back to its corresponding high-quality image. Typically, we use convolutional neural networks to directly learn the mapping from low-quality images to high-quality images achieving image restoration. Recently, a special type of diffusion bridge model has achieved more advanced results in image restoration. It can transform the direct mapping from low-quality to high-quality images into a diffusion process, restoring low-quality images through a reverse process. However, the current diffusion bridge restoration models do not emphasize the idea of conditional control, which may affect performance. This paper introduces the ECDB model enhancing the control of the diffusion bridge with low-quality images as conditions. Moreover, in response to the characteristic of diffusion models having low denoising level at larger values of \(\bm t \), we also propose a Conditional Fusion Schedule, which more effectively handles the conditional feature information of various modules. Experimental results prove that the ECDB model has achieved state-of-the-art results in many image restoration tasks, including deraining, inpainting and super-resolution.

| **[Perceive-IR: Learning to Perceive Degradation Better for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15994v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limitations of task-specific and general image restoration methods for specific degradation have prompted the development of all-in-one image restoration techniques. However, the diversity of patterns among multiple degradation, along with the significant uncertainties in mapping between degraded images of different severities and their corresponding undistorted versions, pose significant challenges to the all-in-one restoration tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Perceive-IR, an all-in-one image restorer designed to achieve fine-grained quality control that enables restored images to more closely resemble their undistorted counterparts, regardless of the type or severity of degradation. Specifically, Perceive-IR contains two stages: (1) prompt learning stage and (2) restoration stage. In the prompt learning stage, we leverage prompt learning to acquire a fine-grained quality perceiver capable of distinguishing three-tier quality levels by constraining the prompt-image similarity in the CLIP perception space. Subsequently, this quality perceiver and difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss are integrated as a quality-aware learning strategy to realize fine-grained quality control in restoration stage. For the restoration stage, a semantic guidance module (SGM) and compact feature extraction (CFE) are proposed to further promote the restoration process by utilizing the robust semantic information from the pre-trained large scale vision models and distinguishing degradation-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Perceive-IR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all-in-one image restoration tasks and exhibit superior generalization ability when dealing with unseen tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Recent research shows that learning discriminative image representations under specific weather conditions can significantly enhance performance. However, the frequent occurrence of unseen extreme weather conditions hinders progress. This paper introduces MCGF, a Multi-weather Cross-view Geo-localization Framework designed to dynamically adapt to unseen weather conditions. MCGF establishes a joint optimization between image restoration and geo-localization using denoising diffusion models. For image restoration, MCGF incorporates a shared encoder and a lightweight restoration module to help the backbone eliminate weather-specific information. For geo-localization, MCGF uses EVA-02 as a backbone for feature extraction, with cross-entropy loss for training and cosine distance for testing. Extensive experiments on University160k-WX demonstrate that MCGF achieves competitive results for geo-localization in varying weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM24 workshop</p></details> |
| **[CODE: Confident Ordinary Differential Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12418v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditioning image generation facilitates seamless editing and the creation of photorealistic images. However, conditioning on noisy or Out-of-Distribution (OoD) images poses significant challenges, particularly in balancing fidelity to the input and realism of the output. We introduce Confident Ordinary Differential Editing (CODE), a novel approach for image synthesis that effectively handles OoD guidance images. Utilizing a diffusion model as a generative prior, CODE enhances images through score-based updates along the probability-flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. This method requires no task-specific training, no handcrafted modules, and no assumptions regarding the corruptions affecting the conditioning image. Our method is compatible with any diffusion model. Positioned at the intersection of conditional image generation and blind image restoration, CODE operates in a fully blind manner, relying solely on a pre-trained generative model. Our method introduces an alternative approach to blind restoration: instead of targeting a specific ground truth image based on assumptions about the underlying corruption, CODE aims to increase the likelihood of the input image while maintaining fidelity. This results in the most probable in-distribution image around the input. Our contributions are twofold. First, CODE introduces a novel editing method based on ODE, providing enhanced control, realism, and fidelity compared to its SDE-based counterpart. Second, we introduce a confidence interval-based clipping method, which improves CODE's effectiveness by allowing it to disregard certain pixels or information, thus enhancing the restoration process in a blind manner. Experimental results demonstrate CODE's effectiveness over existing methods, particularly in scenarios involving severe degradation or OoD inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unfolded proximal neural networks for robust image Gaussian denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03139v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common approach to solve inverse imaging problems relies on finding a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the original unknown image, by solving a minimization problem. In thiscontext, iterative proximal algorithms are widely used, enabling to handle non-smooth functions and linear operators. Recently, these algorithms have been paired with deep learning strategies, to further improve the estimate quality. In particular, proximal neural networks (PNNs) have been introduced, obtained by unrolling a proximal algorithm as for finding a MAP estimate, but over a fixed number of iterations, with learned linear operators and parameters. As PNNs are based on optimization theory, they are very flexible, and can be adapted to any image restoration task, as soon as a proximal algorithm can solve it. They further have much lighter architectures than traditional networks. In this article we propose a unified framework to build PNNs for the Gaussian denoising task, based on both the dual-FB and the primal-dual Chambolle-Pock algorithms. We further show that accelerated inertial versions of these algorithms enable skip connections in the associated NN layers. We propose different learning strategies for our PNN framework, and investigate their robustness (Lipschitz property) and denoising efficiency. Finally, we assess the robustness of our PNNs when plugged in a forward-backward algorithm for an image deblurring problem.</p></details> |  |

However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration.

Diffusion-based inverse problem solvers generate reconstructions of exceptional visual quality from heavily corrupted measurements. However, in what is widely known as the perception-distortion trade-off, the price of perceptually appealing reconstructions is often paid in declined distortion metrics, such as PSNR. Distortion metrics measure faithfulness to the observation, a crucial requirement in inverse problems. In this work, we propose a novel framework for inverse problem solving, namely we assume that the observation comes from a stochastic degradation process that gradually degrades and noises the original clean image. We learn to reverse the degradation process in order to recover the clean image. Our technique maintains consistency with the original measurement throughout the reverse process, and allows for great flexibility in trading off perceptual quality for improved distortion metrics and sampling speedup via early-stopping. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on different high-resolution datasets and inverse problems, achieving great improvements over other state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with respect to both perceptual and distortion metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 15 figures, published at the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning, Vienna, Austria, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Representation Learning for Image Restoration with State-Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10145v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration endeavors to reconstruct a high-quality, detail-rich image from a degraded counterpart, which is a pivotal process in photography and various computer vision systems. In real-world scenarios, different types of degradation can cause the loss of image details at various scales and degrade image contrast. Existing methods predominantly rely on CNN and Transformer to capture multi-scale representations. However, these methods are often limited by the high computational complexity of Transformers and the constrained receptive field of CNN, which hinder them from achieving superior performance and efficiency in image restoration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Scale State-Space Model-based (MS-Mamba) for efficient image restoration that enhances the capacity for multi-scale representation learning through our proposed global and regional SSM modules. Additionally, an Adaptive Gradient Block (AGB) and a Residual Fourier Block (RFB) are proposed to improve the network's detail extraction capabilities by capturing gradients in various directions and facilitating learning details in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on nine public benchmarks across four classic image restoration tasks, image deraining, dehazing, denoising, and low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational complexity.

| **[Harnessing Multi-resolution and Multi-scale Attention for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09912v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater imagery is often compromised by factors such as color distortion and low contrast, posing challenges for high-level vision tasks. Recent underwater image restoration (UIR) methods either analyze the input image at full resolution, resulting in spatial richness but contextual weakness, or progressively from high to low resolution, yielding reliable semantic information but reduced spatial accuracy. Here, we propose a lightweight multi-stage network called Lit-Net that focuses on multi-resolution and multi-scale image analysis for restoring underwater images while retaining original resolution during the first stage, refining features in the second, and focusing on reconstruction in the final stage. Our novel encoder block utilizes parallel $1\times1$ convolution layers to capture local information and speed up operations. Further, we incorporate a modified weighted color channel-specific $l_1$ loss ($cl_1$) function to recover color and detail information. Extensive experimentations on publicly available datasets suggest our model's superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvement in qualitative and quantitative measures, such as $29.477$ dB PSNR ($1.92\%$ improvement) and $0.851$ SSIM ($2.87\%$ improvement) on the EUVP dataset. The contributions of Lit-Net offer a more robust approach to underwater image enhancement and super-resolution, which is of considerable importance for underwater autonomous vehicles and surveillance.

| **[Re-boosting Self-Collaboration Parallel Prompt GAN for Unsupervised Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09241v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised restoration approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a promising solution without requiring paired datasets. Yet, these GAN-based approaches struggle to surpass the performance of conventional unsupervised GAN-based frameworks without significantly modifying model structures or increasing the computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for existing restoration models. This strategy utilizes information from the previous stage as feedback to guide subsequent stages, achieving significant performance improvement without increasing the framework's inference complexity. The SC strategy comprises a prompt learning (PL) module and a restorer ($Res$). It iteratively replaces the previous less powerful fixed restorer $\overline{Res}$ in the PL module with a more powerful $Res$. The enhanced PL module generates better pseudo-degraded/clean image pairs, leading to a more powerful $Res$ for the next iteration. Our SC can significantly improve the $Res$'s performance by over 1.5 dB without adding extra parameters or computational complexity during inference. Meanwhile, existing self-ensemble (SE) and our SC strategies enhance the performance of pre-trained restorers from different perspectives. As SE increases computational complexity during inference, we propose a re-boosting module to the SC (Reb-SC) to improve the SC strategy further by incorporating SE into SC without increasing inference time. This approach further enhances the restorer's performance by approximately 0.3 dB. Extensive experimental results on restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art unsupervised restoration methods.

| **[Multi-task Image Restoration Guided By Robust DINO Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01677v3)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task image restoration has gained significant interest due to its inherent versatility and efficiency compared to its single-task counterpart. However, performance decline is observed with an increase in the number of tasks, primarily attributed to the restoration model's challenge in handling different tasks with distinct natures at the same time. Thus, a perspective emerged aiming to explore the degradation-insensitive semantic commonalities among different degradation tasks. In this paper, we observe that the features of DINOv2 can effectively model semantic information and are independent of degradation factors. Motivated by this observation, we propose \mbox{\textbf{DINO-IR}}, a multi-task image restoration approach leveraging robust features extracted from DINOv2 to solve multi-task image restoration simultaneously. We first propose a pixel-semantic fusion (PSF) module to dynamically fuse DINOV2's shallow features containing pixel-level information and deep features containing degradation-independent semantic information. To guide the restoration model with the features of DINOv2, we develop a DINO-Restore adaption and fusion module to adjust the channel of fused features from PSF and then integrate them with the features from the restoration model. By formulating these modules into a unified deep model, we propose a DINO perception contrastive loss to constrain the model training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DINO-IR performs favorably against existing multi-task image restoration approaches in various tasks by a large margin. The source codes and trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Variational Translator for Bridging Image Restoration and High-Level Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08149v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research tries to extend image restoration capabilities from human perception to machine perception, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks in degraded environments. These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review Learning: Advancing All-in-One Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration Training Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06709v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-in-one image restoration tasks are becoming increasingly important, especially for ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. Existing all-in-one UHD image restoration methods usually boost the model's performance by introducing prompt or customized dynamized networks for different degradation types. For the inference stage, it might be friendly, but in the training stage, since the model encounters multiple degraded images of different quality in an epoch, these cluttered learning objectives might be information pollution for the model. To address this problem, we propose a new training paradigm for general image restoration models, which we name \textbf{Review Learning}, which enables image restoration models to be capable enough to handle multiple types of degradation without prior knowledge and prompts. This approach begins with sequential training of an image restoration model on several degraded datasets, combined with a review mechanism that enhances the image restoration model's memory for several previous classes of degraded datasets. In addition, we design a lightweight all-purpose image restoration network that can efficiently reason about degraded images with 4K ($3840 \times 2160$) resolution on a single consumer-grade GPU.</p></details> |  |

Inpainting, which is used to remove objects or fill in parts of an image, serves as a powerful tool for both image restoration and forgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting image inpainting forgeries by combining DT-CWT with Hierarchical Feature segmentation and with noise inconsistency analysis. The DT-CWT offers several advantages for this task, including inherent shift-invariance, which makes it robust to minor manipulations during the inpainting process, and directional selectivity, which helps capture subtle artifacts introduced by inpainting in specific frequency bands and orientations. By first applying color image segmentation and then analyzing for each segment, noise inconsistency obtained via DT-CW we can identify patterns indicative of inpainting forgeries. The proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark dataset created for this purpose and is compared with existing forgery detection techniques. Our approach demonstrates superior results compared with SOTA in detecting inpainted images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Optimal Transport: A Practical Algorithm for Photo-realistic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02342v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an image restoration algorithm that can control the perceptual quality and/or the mean square error (MSE) of any pre-trained model, trading one over the other at test time. Our algorithm is few-shot: Given about a dozen images restored by the model, it can significantly improve the perceptual quality and/or the MSE of the model for newly restored images without further training. Our approach is motivated by a recent theoretical result that links between the minimum MSE (MMSE) predictor and the predictor that minimizes the MSE under a perfect perceptual quality constraint. Specifically, it has been shown that the latter can be obtained by optimally transporting the output of the former, such that its distribution matches the source data. Thus, to improve the perceptual quality of a predictor that was originally trained to minimize MSE, we approximate the optimal transport by a linear transformation in the latent space of a variational auto-encoder, which we compute in closed-form using empirical means and covariances. Going beyond the theory, we find that applying the same procedure on models that were initially trained to achieve high perceptual quality, typically improves their perceptual quality even further. And by interpolating the results with the original output of the model, we can improve their MSE on the expense of perceptual quality. We illustrate our method on a variety of degradations applied to general content images of arbitrary dimensions.</p></details> |  |

It is demonstrated that our algorithms converge to the unique least-norm solution of the matrix equation when it is consistent and their convergence rate is faster than that of the randomized block Kaczmarz method (ME-RBK). Moreover, the block Kaczmarz method (ME-BK) for solving the matrix equation $AXB=C$ is investigated and it is found that the ME-BK method converges to the solution $A^{+}CB^{+}+X^{0}-A^{+}AX^{0}BB^{+}$ when it is consistent.

This paper introduces a Physical Prior Guided Cooperative Learning (P2GCL) framework to jointly enhance atmospheric turbulence strength estimation and infrared image restoration. P2GCL involves a cyclic collaboration between two models, i.e., a TMNet measures turbulence strength and outputs the refractive index structure constant (Cn2) as a physical prior, a TRNet conducts infrared image sequence restoration based on Cn2 and feeds the restored images back to the TMNet to boost the measurement accuracy. A novel Cn2-guided frequency loss function and a physical constraint loss are introduced to align the training process with physical theories. Experiments demonstrate P2GCL achieves the best performance for both turbulence strength estimation (improving Cn2 MAE by 0.0156, enhancing R2 by 0.1065) and image restoration (enhancing PSNR by 0.2775 dB), validating the significant impact of physical prior guided cooperative learning.</p></details> | 21 |
| **[MultiColor: Image Colorization by Learning from Multiple Color Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04172v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep networks have shown impressive performance in the image restoration tasks, such as image colorization. However, we find that previous approaches rely on the digital representation from single color model with a specific mapping function, a.k.a., color space, during the colorization pipeline. In this paper, we first investigate the modeling of different color spaces, and find each of them exhibiting distinctive characteristics with unique distribution of colors. The complementarity among multiple color spaces leads to benefits for the image colorization task. We present MultiColor, a new learning-based approach to automatically colorize grayscale images that combines clues from multiple color spaces. Specifically, we employ a set of dedicated colorization modules for individual color space. Within each module, a transformer decoder is first employed to refine color query embeddings and then a color mapper produces color channel prediction using the embeddings and semantic features. With these predicted color channels representing various color spaces, a complementary network is designed to exploit the complementarity and generate pleasing and reasonable colorized images. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Posterior Proximal Sampling for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16907v2)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in generating high-quality samples. Existing diffusion-based image restoration algorithms exploit pre-trained diffusion models to leverage data priors, yet they still preserve elements inherited from the unconditional generation paradigm. These strategies initiate the denoising process with pure white noise and incorporate random noise at each generative step, leading to over-smoothed results. In this paper, we present a refined paradigm for diffusion-based image restoration. Specifically, we opt for a sample consistent with the measurement identity at each generative step, exploiting the sampling selection as an avenue for output stability and enhancement. The number of candidate samples used for selection is adaptively determined based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the timestep. Additionally, we start the restoration process with an initialization combined with the measurement signal, providing supplementary information to better align the generative process. Extensive experimental results and analyses validate that our proposed method significantly enhances image restoration performance while consuming negligible additional computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM Multimedia 2024 Oral</p></details> |
| **[Holistic Dynamic Frequency Transformer for Image Fusion and Exposure Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01183v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The correction of exposure-related issues is a pivotal component in enhancing the quality of images, offering substantial implications for various computer vision tasks. Historically, most methodologies have predominantly utilized spatial domain recovery, offering limited consideration to the potentialities of the frequency domain. Additionally, there has been a lack of a unified perspective towards low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, complicating and impeding the optimization of image processing. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology that leverages the frequency domain to improve and unify the handling of exposure correction tasks. Our method introduces Holistic Frequency Attention and Dynamic Frequency Feed-Forward Network, which replace conventional correlation computation in the spatial-domain. They form a foundational building block that facilitates a U-shaped Holistic Dynamic Frequency Transformer as a filter to extract global information and dynamically select important frequency bands for image restoration. Complementing this, we employ a Laplacian pyramid to decompose images into distinct frequency bands, followed by multiple restorers, each tuned to recover specific frequency-band information. The pyramid fusion allows a more detailed and nuanced image restoration process. Ultimately, our structure unifies the three tasks of low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, enabling comprehensive treatment of all classical exposure errors. Benchmarking on mainstream datasets for these tasks, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, paving the way for more sophisticated and unified solutions in exposure correction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contribution-based Low-Rank Adaptation with Pre-training Model for Real Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01099v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pre-trained model and efficient parameter tuning have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and high-level computer vision with the aid of masked modeling and prompt tuning. In low-level computer vision, however, there have been limited investigations on pre-trained models and even efficient fine-tuning strategy has not yet been explored despite its importance and benefit in various real-world tasks such as alleviating memory inflation issue when integrating new tasks on AI edge devices. Here, we propose a novel efficient parameter tuning approach dubbed contribution-based low-rank adaptation (CoLoRA) for multiple image restorations along with effective pre-training method with random order degradations (PROD). Unlike prior arts that tune all network parameters, our CoLoRA effectively fine-tunes small amount of parameters by leveraging LoRA (low-rank adaptation) for each new vision task with our contribution-based method to adaptively determine layer by layer capacity for that task to yield comparable performance to full tuning. Furthermore, our PROD strategy allows to extend the capability of pre-trained models with improved performance as well as robustness to bridge synthetic pre-training and real-world fine-tuning. Our CoLoRA with PROD has demonstrated its superior performance in various image restoration tasks across diverse degradation types on both synthetic and real-world datasets for known and novel tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 15 figures, for homepage see this url : https://janeyeon.github.io/colora/</p></details> |
| **[Osmosis: RGBD Diffusion Prior for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14837v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater image restoration is a challenging task because of water effects that increase dramatically with distance. This is worsened by lack of ground truth data of clean scenes without water. Diffusion priors have emerged as strong image restoration priors. However, they are often trained with a dataset of the desired restored output, which is not available in our case. We also observe that using only color data is insufficient, and therefore augment the prior with a depth channel. We train an unconditional diffusion model prior on the joint space of color and depth, using standard RGBD datasets of natural outdoor scenes in air. Using this prior together with a novel guidance method based on the underwater image formation model, we generate posterior samples of clean images, removing the water effects. Even though our prior did not see any underwater images during training, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image restoration on very challenging scenes. Our code, models and data are available on the project website.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

However, extending this technique to 3D remains a challenge. Existing 3D drag-based editing methods, whether employing explicit spatial transformations or relying on implicit latent optimization within limited-capacity 3D generative models, fall short in handling significant topology changes or generating new textures across diverse object categories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MVDrag3D, a novel framework for more flexible and creative drag-based 3D editing that leverages multi-view generation and reconstruction priors. At the core of our approach is the usage of a multi-view diffusion model as a strong generative prior to perform consistent drag editing over multiple rendered views, which is followed by a reconstruction model that reconstructs 3D Gaussians of the edited object. While the initial 3D Gaussians may suffer from misalignment between different views, we address this via view-specific deformation networks that adjust the position of Gaussians to be well aligned. In addition, we propose a multi-view score function that distills generative priors from multiple views to further enhance the view consistency and visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVDrag3D provides a precise, generative, and flexible solution for 3D drag-based editing, supporting more versatile editing effects across various object categories and 3D representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[A Framework for Evaluating Predictive Models Using Synthetic Image Covariates and Longitudinal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16177v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework for synthesizing patient data with complex covariates (e.g., eye scans) paired with longitudinal observations (e.g., visual acuity over time), addressing privacy concerns in healthcare research. Our approach introduces controlled association in latent spaces generating each data modality, enabling the creation of complex covariate-longitudinal observation pairs. This framework facilitates the development of predictive models and provides openly available benchmarking datasets for healthcare research. We demonstrate our framework using optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, though it is applicable across domains. Using 109,309 2D OCT scan slices, we trained an image generative model combining a variational autoencoder and a diffusion model. Longitudinal observations were simulated using a nonlinear mixed effect (NLME) model from a low-dimensional space of random effects. We generated 1.1M OCT scan slices paired with five sets of longitudinal observations at controlled association levels (100%, 50%, 10%, 5.26%, and 2% of between-subject variability). To assess the framework, we modeled synthetic longitudinal observations with another NLME model, computed empirical Bayes estimates of random effects, and trained a ResNet to predict these estimates from synthetic OCT scans. We then incorporated ResNet predictions into the NLME model for patient-individualized predictions. Prediction accuracy on withheld data declined as intended with reduced association between images and longitudinal measurements. Notably, in all but the 2% case, we achieved within 50% of the theoretical best possible prediction on withheld data, demonstrating our ability to detect even weak signals. This confirms the effectiveness of our framework in generating synthetic data with controlled levels of association, providing a valuable tool for healthcare research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Warped Diffusion: Solving Video Inverse Problems with Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16152v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using image models naively for solving inverse video problems often suffers from flickering, texture-sticking, and temporal inconsistency in generated videos. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we view frames as continuous functions in the 2D space, and videos as a sequence of continuous warping transformations between different frames. This perspective allows us to train function space diffusion models only on images and utilize them to solve temporally correlated inverse problems. The function space diffusion models need to be equivariant with respect to the underlying spatial transformations. To ensure temporal consistency, we introduce a simple post-hoc test-time guidance towards (self)-equivariant solutions. Our method allows us to deploy state-of-the-art latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL to solve video inverse problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for video inpainting and $8\times$ video super-resolution, outperforming existing techniques based on noise transformations. We provide generated video results: https://giannisdaras.github.io/warped\_diffusion.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. (3) RACCooN also plans to imagine new objects in a given video, so users simply prompt the model to receive a detailed video editing plan for complex video editing. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contribute equally.

Considering their inherent layer-wise structure, we simulate layer-wise autoregressive generation by designing different denoising speed for different layers. Unlike conventional autoregressive generation that lacks a global graph structure view, our method maintains a complete graph structure at each diffusion step, enabling operations such as property control that require the full graph structure. Leveraging this capability, we evaluate the DAG properties during training by employing a graph property decoder. We explicitly train the model to learn graph conditioning with a condition loss, which enhances the diffusion model's capacity to generate graphs that are both realistic and aligned with specified properties. We evaluate our method on two representative conditional DAG generation tasks: (1) circuit generation from truth tables, where precise DAG structures are crucial for realizing circuit functionality, and (2) molecule generation based on quantum properties. Our approach demonstrates promising results, generating high-quality and realistic DAGs that closely align with given conditions.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements in neural solvers, their limited expressiveness struggles to capture the multi-modal nature of CO landscapes. While some research has shifted towards diffusion models, these models still sample solutions indiscriminately from the entire NP-complete solution space with time-consuming denoising processes, which limit their practicality for large problem scales. We propose DISCO, an efficient DIffusion Solver for large-scale Combinatorial Optimization problems that excels in both solution quality and inference speed. DISCO's efficacy is twofold: First, it enhances solution quality by constraining the sampling space to a more meaningful domain guided by solution residues, while preserving the multi-modal properties of the output distributions. Second, it accelerates the denoising process through an analytically solvable approach, enabling solution sampling with minimal reverse-time steps and significantly reducing inference time. DISCO delivers strong performance on large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems and challenging Maximal Independent Set benchmarks, with inference time up to 5.28 times faster than other diffusion alternatives. By incorporating a divide-and-conquer strategy, DISCO can well generalize to solve unseen-scale problem instances, even surpassing models specifically trained for those scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[CamI2V: Camera-Controlled Image-to-Video Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15957v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, camera pose, as a user-friendly and physics-related condition, has been introduced into text-to-video diffusion model for camera control. However, existing methods simply inject camera conditions through a side input. These approaches neglect the inherent physical knowledge of camera pose, resulting in imprecise camera control, inconsistencies, and also poor interpretability. In this paper, we emphasize the necessity of integrating explicit physical constraints into model design. Epipolar attention is proposed for modeling all cross-frame relationships from a novel perspective of noised condition. This ensures that features are aggregated from corresponding epipolar lines in all noised frames, overcoming the limitations of current attention mechanisms in tracking displaced features across frames, especially when features move significantly with the camera and become obscured by noise. Additionally, we introduce register tokens to handle cases without intersections between frames, commonly caused by rapid camera movements, dynamic objects, or occlusions. To support image-to-video, we propose the multiple guidance scale to allow for precise control for image, text, and camera, respectively. Furthermore, we establish a more robust and reproducible evaluation pipeline to solve the inaccuracy and instability of existing camera control measurement. We achieve a 25.5\% improvement in camera controllability on RealEstate10K while maintaining strong generalization to out-of-domain images. Only 24GB and 12GB are required for training and inference, respectively. We plan to release checkpoints, along with training and evaluation codes.

| **[Towards Realistic Data Generation for Real-World Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07255v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing image super-resolution (SR) techniques often fail to generalize effectively in complex real-world settings due to the significant divergence between training data and practical scenarios. To address this challenge, previous efforts have either manually simulated intricate physical-based degradations or utilized learning-based techniques, yet these approaches remain inadequate for producing large-scale, realistic, and diverse data simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce a novel Realistic Decoupled Data Generator (RealDGen), an unsupervised learning data generation framework designed for real-world super-resolution. We meticulously develop content and degradation extraction strategies, which are integrated into a novel content-degradation decoupled diffusion model to create realistic low-resolution images from unpaired real LR and HR images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDGen excels in generating large-scale, high-quality paired data that mirrors real-world degradations, significantly advancing the performance of popular SR models on various real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the process by which the encoder produces the text representation is unknown. We propose the Diffusion Lens, a method for analyzing the text encoder of T2I models by generating images from its intermediate representations. Using the Diffusion Lens, we perform an extensive analysis of two recent T2I models. Exploring compound prompts, we find that complex scenes describing multiple objects are composed progressively and more slowly compared to simple scenes; Exploring knowledge retrieval, we find that representation of uncommon concepts requires further computation compared to common concepts, and that knowledge retrieval is gradual across layers. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the text encoder component in T2I pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: ACL 2024 Project webpage: tokeron.github.io/DiffusionLensWeb</p></details> |

Despite the availability of numerous techniques for detecting manipulated images captured by conventional cameras, their applicability to medical images is limited. This limitation stems from the distinctive forensic characteristics of medical images, a result of their imaging process. In this work we propose a novel anomaly detector for medical imagery based on diffusion models. Normally, diffusion models are used to generate images. However, we show how a similar process can be used to detect synthetic content by making a model reverse the diffusion on a suspected image. We evaluate our method on the task of detecting fake tumors injected and removed from CT and MRI scans. Our method significantly outperforms other state of the art unsupervised detectors with an increased AUC of 0.9 from 0.79 for injection and of 0.96 from 0.91 for removal on average. We also explore our hypothesis using AI explainability tools and publish our code and new medical deepfake datasets to encourage further research into this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[You Only Sample Once: Taming One-Step Text-to-Image Synthesis by Self-Cooperative Diffusion GANs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12931v5)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, some works have tried to combine diffusion and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to alleviate the computational cost of the iterative denoising inference in Diffusion Models (DMs). However, existing works in this line suffer from either training instability and mode collapse or subpar one-step generation learning efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce YOSO, a novel generative model designed for rapid, scalable, and high-fidelity one-step image synthesis with high training stability and mode coverage. Specifically, we smooth the adversarial divergence by the denoising generator itself, performing self-cooperative learning. We show that our method can serve as a one-step generation model training from scratch with competitive performance. Moreover, we extend our YOSO to one-step text-to-image generation based on pre-trained models by several effective training techniques (i.e., latent perceptual loss and latent discriminator for efficient training along with the latent DMs; the informative prior initialization (IPI), and the quick adaption stage for fixing the flawed noise scheduler). Experimental results show that YOSO achieves the state-of-the-art one-step generation performance even with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. In particular, we show that the YOSO-PixArt-$\alpha$ can generate images in one step trained on 512 resolution, with the capability of adapting to 1024 resolution without extra explicit training, requiring only ~10 A800 days for fine-tuning.

| **[Solving Continual Offline RL through Selective Weights Activation on Aligned Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15698v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual offline reinforcement learning (CORL) has shown impressive ability in diffusion-based lifelong learning systems by modeling the joint distributions of trajectories. However, most research only focuses on limited continual task settings where the tasks have the same observation and action space, which deviates from the realistic demands of training agents in various environments. In view of this, we propose Vector-Quantized Continual Diffuser, named VQ-CD, to break the barrier of different spaces between various tasks. Specifically, our method contains two complementary sections, where the quantization spaces alignment provides a unified basis for the selective weights activation. In the quantized spaces alignment, we leverage vector quantization to align the different state and action spaces of various tasks, facilitating continual training in the same space. Then, we propose to leverage a unified diffusion model attached by the inverse dynamic model to master all tasks by selectively activating different weights according to the task-related sparse masks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 continual learning (CL) tasks, including conventional CL task settings (identical state and action spaces) and general CL task settings (various state and action spaces). Compared with 16 baselines, our method reaches the SOTA performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models as Constrained Samplers for Optimization with Unknown Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18012v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing real-world optimization problems becomes particularly challenging when analytic objective functions or constraints are unavailable. While numerous studies have addressed the issue of unknown objectives, limited research has focused on scenarios where feasibility constraints are not given explicitly. Overlooking these constraints can lead to spurious solutions that are unrealistic in practice. To deal with such unknown constraints, we propose to perform optimization within the data manifold using diffusion models. To constrain the optimization process to the data manifold, we reformulate the original optimization problem as a sampling problem from the product of the Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function and the data distribution learned by the diffusion model. Depending on the differentiability of the objective function, we propose two different sampling methods. For differentiable objectives, we propose a two-stage framework that begins with a guided diffusion process for warm-up, followed by a Langevin dynamics stage for further correction. For non-differentiable objectives, we propose an iterative importance sampling strategy using the diffusion model as the proposal distribution. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset, six real-world black-box optimization datasets, and a multi-objective molecule optimization dataset show that our method achieves better or comparable performance with previous state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Erasing Undesirable Concepts in Diffusion Models with Adversarial Preservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15618v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generating visually striking content from text but can inadvertently produce undesirable or harmful content when trained on unfiltered internet data. A practical solution is to selectively removing target concepts from the model, but this may impact the remaining concepts. Prior approaches have tried to balance this by introducing a loss term to preserve neutral content or a regularization term to minimize changes in the model parameters, yet resolving this trade-off remains challenging. In this work, we propose to identify and preserving concepts most affected by parameter changes, termed as \textit{adversarial concepts}. This approach ensures stable erasure with minimal impact on the other concepts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using the Stable Diffusion model, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods in eliminating unwanted content while maintaining the integrity of other unrelated elements.

Data augmentation, which involves generating synthetic data from existing datasets, has gained significant attention as a solution to data scarcity. In particular, diffusion models have become a powerful technique for generating synthetic data, especially in fields like computer vision. This paper explores the potential of diffusion models to generate synthetic tabular data to improve AI fairness. The Tabular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Tab-DDPM), a diffusion model adaptable to any tabular dataset and capable of handling various feature types, was utilized with different amounts of generated data for data augmentation. Additionally, reweighting samples from AIF360 was employed to further enhance AI fairness. Five traditional machine learning models-Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF)-were used to validate the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data generated by Tab-DDPM improves fairness in binary classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.12560</p></details> |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Previous investigations in medical images have often been constrained to specific anatomical regions, particular applications, and limited datasets, resulting in isolated diffusion models. This paper introduces a diffusion-based foundation model to address a diverse range of medical image tasks, namely MedDiff-FM. MedDiff-FM leverages 3D CT images from multiple publicly available datasets, covering anatomical regions from head to abdomen, to pre-train a diffusion foundation model, and explores the capabilities of the diffusion foundation model across a variety of application scenarios. The diffusion foundation model handles multi-level image processing both at the image-level and patch-level, and utilizes position embedding to establish multi-level spatial relationships as well as anatomical structures and region classes to control certain anatomical regions. MedDiff-FM manages several downstream tasks seamlessly, including image denoising, anomaly detection, and image synthesis. MedDiff-FM is also capable of performing lesion generation and lesion inpainting by rapidly fine-tuning the diffusion foundation model using ControlNet with task-specific conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MedDiff-FM in addressing diverse downstream medical image tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffX: Guide Your Layout to Cross-Modal Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15488v5)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have made significant strides in language-driven and layout-driven image generation. However, most diffusion models are limited to visible RGB image generation. In fact, human perception of the world is enriched by diverse viewpoints, such as chromatic contrast, thermal illumination, and depth information. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion model for general layout-guided cross-modal generation, called DiffX. Notably, our DiffX presents a compact and effective cross-modal generative modeling pipeline, which conducts diffusion and denoising processes in the modality-shared latent space. Moreover, we introduce the Joint-Modality Embedder (JME) to enhance the interaction between layout and text conditions by incorporating a gated attention mechanism. To facilitate the user-instructed training, we construct the cross-modal image datasets with detailed text captions by the Large-Multimodal Model (LMM) and our human-in-the-loop refinement. Through extensive experiments, our DiffX demonstrates robustness in cross-modal ''RGB+X'' image generation on FLIR, MFNet, and COME15K datasets, guided by various layout conditions. Meanwhile, it shows the strong potential for the adaptive generation of ``RGB+X+Y(+Z)'' images or more diverse modalities on FLIR, MFNet, COME15K, and MCXFace datasets. To our knowledge, DiffX is the first model for layout-guided cross-modal image generation. Our code and constructed cross-modal image datasets are available at https://github.com/zeyuwang-zju/DiffX.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring multiple images, even of low quality, is possible with surveillance cameras. In this work, we develop an algorithm based on diffusion models that utilize a low-resolution image combined with features extracted from multiple low-quality images to generate a super-resolved image while minimizing distortions in the individual's identity. Unlike other algorithms, our approach recovers facial features without explicitly providing attribute information or without the need to calculate a gradient of a function during the reconstruction process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time multi-features combined with low-resolution images are used as conditioners to generate more reliable super-resolution images using stochastic differential equations. The FFHQ dataset was employed for training, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in facial recognition and verification metrics when evaluated on the CelebA and Quis-Campi datasets.

Sana can synthesize high-resolution, high-quality images with strong text-image alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on laptop GPU. Core designs include: (1) Deep compression autoencoder: unlike traditional AEs, which compress images only 8$\times$, we trained an AE that can compress images 32$\times$, effectively reducing the number of latent tokens. (2) Linear DiT: we replace all vanilla attention in DiT with linear attention, which is more efficient at high resolutions without sacrificing quality. (3) Decoder-only text encoder: we replaced T5 with modern decoder-only small LLM as the text encoder and designed complex human instruction with in-context learning to enhance the image-text alignment. (4) Efficient training and sampling: we propose Flow-DPM-Solver to reduce sampling steps, with efficient caption labeling and selection to accelerate convergence. As a result, Sana-0.6B is very competitive with modern giant diffusion model (e.g. Flux-12B), being 20 times smaller and 100+ times faster in measured throughput. Moreover, Sana-0.6B can be deployed on a 16GB laptop GPU, taking less than 1 second to generate a 1024$\times$1024 resolution image. Sana enables content creation at low cost.

| **[Diffusion-based Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09369v4)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has been effectively utilized to enhance the training of sequential recommendation models by leveraging informative self-supervised signals. Most existing approaches generate augmented views of the same user sequence through random augmentation and subsequently maximize their agreement in the representation space. However, these methods often neglect the rationality of the augmented samples. Due to significant uncertainty, random augmentation can disrupt the semantic information and interest evolution patterns inherent in the original user sequences. Moreover, pulling semantically inconsistent sequences closer in the representation space can render the user sequence embeddings insensitive to variations in user preferences, which contradicts the primary objective of sequential recommendation. To address these limitations, we propose the Context-aware Diffusion-based Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation, named CaDiRec. The core idea is to leverage context information to generate more reasonable augmented views. Specifically, CaDiRec employs a context-aware diffusion model to generate alternative items for the given positions within a sequence. These generated items are aligned with their respective context information and can effectively replace the corresponding original items, thereby generating a positive view of the original sequence. By considering two different augmentations of the same user sequence, we can construct a pair of positive samples for contrastive learning. To ensure representation cohesion, we train the entire framework in an end-to-end manner, with shared item embeddings between the diffusion model and the recommendation model. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method over existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Recently, diffusion models have performed well in this field. However, sacrificing inference speed to exchange with high-quality sample generation limits its application scenarios. In order to obtain high quality synthetic singing voice more efficiently, we propose a singing voice synthesis method based on the consistency model, ConSinger, to achieve high-fidelity singing voice synthesis with minimal steps. The model is trained by applying consistency constraint and the generation quality is greatly improved at the expense of a small amount of inference speed. Our experiments show that ConSinger is highly competitive with the baseline model in terms of generation speed and quality.

However, accurately estimating the drift term in the reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) solely from the unnormalized target density poses significant challenges, hindering existing methods from achieving state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we introduce the Diffusion-PINN Sampler (DPS), a novel diffusion-based sampling algorithm that estimates the drift term by solving the governing partial differential equation of the log-density of the underlying SDE marginals via physics-informed neural networks (PINN). We prove that the error of log-density approximation can be controlled by the PINN residual loss, enabling us to establish convergence guarantees of DPS. Experiments on a variety of sampling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in accurately identifying mixing proportions when the target contains isolated components.</p></details> | 33 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality. We further deploy the FoMo on the JiuTian optimization platform of China Mobile, where we use the predicted mobile data to formulate network planning and optimization applications, including BS deployment, resource block scheduling, and BS sleep control.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

However, they often struggle to accurately follow fine-grained spatial information in an input text. To this end, we propose a compositional approach for text-to-image generation based on two stages. In the first stage, we design a diffusion-based generative model to produce one or more aligned intermediate representations (such as depth or segmentation maps) conditioned on text. In the second stage, we map these representations, together with the text, to the final output image using a separate diffusion-based generative model. Our findings indicate that such compositional approach can improve image generation, resulting in a notable improvement in FID score and a comparable CLIP score, when compared to the standard non-compositional baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Compositional Learning: Perspectives, Methods, and Paths Forward</p></details> |

However, while remarkable reconstruction performances have been achieved, their inference time is typically too slow since most of them rely on the seminal diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) framework and thus to approximate the intractable likelihood score, time-consuming gradient calculation through back-propagation is needed. To address this issue, this paper provides a fast and effective solution by proposing a simple closed-form approximation to the likelihood score. For both diffusion and flow-based models, extensive experiments are conducted on various noisy linear inverse problems such as noisy super-resolution, denoising, deblurring, and colorization. In all these tasks, our method (namely DMPS) demonstrates highly competitive or even better reconstruction performances while being significantly faster than all the baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACML2024.

This is commonly achieved by conditioning the network of noise predictor with low-resolution audio. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling algorithm that communicates the information of the low-resolution audio via the reverse sampling process of DMs. The proposed method can be a drop-in replacement for the vanilla sampling process and can significantly improve the performance of the existing works. Moreover, by coupling the proposed sampling method with an unconditional DM, i.e., a DM with no auxiliary inputs to its noise predictor, we can generalize it to a wide range of SR setups. We also attain state-of-the-art results on the VCTK Multi-Speaker benchmark with this novel formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICASSP 2023</p></details> |

Inevitably, the issue of missing data caused by various disturbances threatens the reliability of data acquisition. Recent studies of diffusion probability models have demonstrated the superiority of deep generative models in imputation tasks by precisely capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic data. One drawback of diffusion models is their slow sampling/denoising process. In this work, we aim to accelerate the imputation process while retaining the performance. We propose a fast conditional diffusion model for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation (FastSTI). To speed up the process yet, obtain better performance, we propose the application of a high-order pseudo-numerical solver. Our method further revs the imputation by introducing a predefined alignment strategy of variance schedule during the sampling process. Evaluating FastSTI on two types of real-world traffic datasets (traffic speed and flow) with different missing data scenarios proves its ability to impute higher-quality samples in only six sampling steps, especially under high missing rates (60\% $\sim$ 90\%). The experimental results illustrate a speed-up of $\textbf{8.3} \times$ faster than the current state-of-the-art model while achieving better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems for publication.

These models allow us to sample from the posterior distribution of a target signal given an observed signal by manipulating the diffusion process. However, when separating audio sources of the same type, such as duet singing voices, the prior learned by the diffusion process may not be sufficient to maintain the consistency of the source identity in the separated audio. For example, the singer may change from one to another occasionally. Tackling this problem will be useful for separating sources in a choir, or a mixture of multiple instruments with similar timbre, without acquiring large amounts of paired data. In this paper, we examine this problem in the context of duet singing voices separation, and propose a method to enforce the coherency of singer identity by splitting the mixture into overlapping segments and performing posterior sampling in an auto-regressive manner, conditioning on the previous segment. We evaluate the proposed method on the MedleyVox dataset and show that the proposed method outperforms the naive posterior sampling baseline.

| **[DaLPSR: Leverage Degradation-Aligned Language Prompt for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16477v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level.

To this end, we study the task of predicting the prompt embedding given an image generated by a generative diffusion model. We consider a series of white-box and black-box models (with and without access to the weights of the diffusion network) to deal with the proposed task. We propose a novel learning framework comprising a joint prompt regression and multi-label vocabulary classification objective that generates improved prompts. To further improve our method, we employ a curriculum learning procedure that promotes the learning of image-prompt pairs with lower labeling noise (i.e. that are better aligned). We conduct experiments on the DiffusionDB data set, predicting text prompts from images generated by Stable Diffusion. In addition, we make an interesting discovery: training a diffusion model on the prompt generation task can make the model generate images that are much better aligned with the input prompts, when the model is directly reused for text-to-image generation.

Recent advances in generative models have significantly enhanced rational antibody design. However, existing methods mainly create antibodies from scratch without template constraints, leading to model optimization challenges and unnatural sequences. To address these issues, we propose a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework, termed RADAb, for efficient antibody design. Our method leverages a set of structural homologous motifs that align with query structural constraints to guide the generative model in inversely optimizing antibodies according to desired design criteria. Specifically, we introduce a structure-informed retrieval mechanism that integrates these exemplar motifs with the input backbone through a novel dual-branch denoising module, utilizing both structural and evolutionary information. Additionally, we develop a conditional diffusion model that iteratively refines the optimization process by incorporating both global context and local evolutionary conditions. Our approach is agnostic to the choice of generative models. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple antibody inverse folding and optimization tasks, offering a new perspective on biomolecular generative models.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods train specific networks or utilize pre-trained models to learn content and style features. However, they rely solely on textual or spatial representations that are inadequate to achieve the balance between content and style. In this work, we propose a novel and training-free approach for style transfer, combining textual embedding with spatial features and separating the injection of content or style. Specifically, we adopt the BLIP-2 encoder to extract the textual representation of the style image. We utilize the DDIM inversion technique to extract intermediate embeddings in content and style branches as spatial features. Finally, we harness the step-by-step property of diffusion models by separating the injection of content and style in the target branch, which improves the balance between content preservation and style fusion.

The backdoor attack is a method that implants vulnerabilities in a target model, which can be activated through a trigger. In this work, we innovatively prevent the abuse of image content modification by implanting the backdoor into image-editing models. Once the protected sensitive content on an image is modified by an editing model, the backdoor will be triggered, making the editing fail. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks that use data poisoning, to enable protection on individual images and eliminate the need for model training, we developed the first framework for run-time backdoor implantation, which is both time- and resource- efficient. We generate imperceptible perturbations on the images to inject the backdoor and define the protected area as the only backdoor trigger. Editing other unprotected insensitive areas will not trigger the backdoor, which minimizes the negative impact on legal image modifications. Evaluations with state-of-the-art image editing models show that our protective method can increase the CLIP-FID of generated images from 12.72 to 39.91, or reduce the SSIM from 0.503 to 0.167 when subjected to malicious editing. At the same time, our method exhibits minimal impact on benign editing, which demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed framework. The proposed run-time backdoor can also achieve effective protection on the latest diffusion models. Code are available.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Existing SBDMs are typically formulated in a finite-dimensional setting, where images are considered as tensors of finite size. This paper develops SBDMs in the infinite-dimensional setting, that is, we model the training data as functions supported on a rectangular domain. In addition to the quest for generating images at ever-higher resolutions, our primary motivation is to create a well-posed infinite-dimensional learning problem that we can discretize consistently on multiple resolution levels. We thereby intend to obtain diffusion models that generalize across different resolution levels and improve the efficiency of the training process. We demonstrate how to overcome two shortcomings of current SBDM approaches in the infinite-dimensional setting. First, we modify the forward process using trace class operators to ensure that the latent distribution is well-defined in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive the reverse processes for finite-dimensional approximations. Second, we illustrate that approximating the score function with an operator network is beneficial for multilevel training. After deriving the convergence of the discretization and the approximation of multilevel training, we demonstrate some practical benefits of our infinite-dimensional SBDM approach on a synthetic Gaussian mixture example, the MNIST dataset, and a dataset generated from a nonlinear 2D reaction-diffusion equation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Straightness of Rectified Flow: A Theoretical Insight into Wasserstein Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14949v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for image generation and denoising. Typically, generative models learn a trajectory between the starting noise distribution and the target data distribution. Recently Liu et al. (2023b) designed a novel alternative generative model Rectified Flow (RF), which aims to learn straight flow trajectories from noise to data using a sequence of convex optimization problems with close ties to optimal transport. If the trajectory is curved, one must use many Euler discretization steps or novel strategies, such as exponential integrators, to achieve a satisfactory generation quality. In contrast, RF has been shown to theoretically straighten the trajectory through successive rectifications, reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) while sampling. It has also been shown empirically that RF may improve the straightness in two rectifications if one can solve the underlying optimization problem within a sufficiently small error. In this paper, we make two key theoretical contributions: 1) we provide the first theoretical analysis of the Wasserstein distance between the sampling distribution of RF and the target distribution. Our error rate is characterized by the number of discretization steps and a new formulation of straightness stronger than that in the original work. 2) In line with the previous empirical findings, we show that, for a rectified flow from a Gaussian to a mixture of two Gaussians, two rectifications are sufficient to achieve a straight flow. Additionally, we also present empirical results on both simulated and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

| **[Adversarial Score identity Distillation: Rapidly Surpassing the Teacher in One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14919v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score identity Distillation (SiD) is a data-free method that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in image generation by leveraging only a pretrained diffusion model, without requiring any training data. However, the ultimate performance of SiD is constrained by the accuracy with which the pretrained model captures the true data scores at different stages of the diffusion process. In this paper, we introduce SiDA (SiD with Adversarial Loss), which not only enhances generation quality but also improves distillation efficiency by incorporating real images and adversarial loss. SiDA utilizes the encoder from the generator's score network as a discriminator, boosting its ability to distinguish between real images and those generated by SiD. The adversarial loss is batch-normalized within each GPU and then combined with the original SiD loss. This integration effectively incorporates the average "fakeness" per GPU batch into the pixel-based SiD loss, enabling SiDA to distill a single-step generator either from scratch or by fine-tuning an existing one. SiDA converges significantly faster than its predecessor when trained from scratch, and swiftly improves upon the original model's performance after an initial warmup period during fine-tuning from a pre-distilled SiD generator. This one-step adversarial distillation method has set new benchmarks for generation performance when distilling EDM diffusion models pretrained on CIFAR-10 (32x32) and ImageNet (64x64), achieving FID scores of $\mathbf{1.499}$ on CIFAR-10 unconditional, $\mathbf{1.396}$ on CIFAR-10 conditional, and $\mathbf{1.110}$ on ImageNet 64x64.

| **[Truncated Consistency Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14895v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency models have recently been introduced to accelerate sampling from diffusion models by directly predicting the solution (i.e., data) of the probability flow ODE (PF ODE) from initial noise. However, the training of consistency models requires learning to map all intermediate points along PF ODE trajectories to their corresponding endpoints. This task is much more challenging than the ultimate objective of one-step generation, which only concerns the PF ODE's noise-to-data mapping. We empirically find that this training paradigm limits the one-step generation performance of consistency models. To address this issue, we generalize consistency training to the truncated time range, which allows the model to ignore denoising tasks at earlier time steps and focus its capacity on generation. We propose a new parameterization of the consistency function and a two-stage training procedure that prevents the truncated-time training from collapsing to a trivial solution. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\times64$ datasets show that our method achieves better one-step and two-step FIDs than the state-of-the-art consistency models such as iCT-deep, using more than 2$\times$ smaller networks.

| **[Variational Distillation of Diffusion Policies into Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12538v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces Variational Diffusion Distillation (VDD), a novel method that distills denoising diffusion policies into Mixtures of Experts (MoE) through variational inference. Diffusion Models are the current state-of-the-art in generative modeling due to their exceptional ability to accurately learn and represent complex, multi-modal distributions. This ability allows Diffusion Models to replicate the inherent diversity in human behavior, making them the preferred models in behavior learning such as Learning from Human Demonstrations (LfD). However, diffusion models come with some drawbacks, including the intractability of likelihoods and long inference times due to their iterative sampling process. The inference times, in particular, pose a significant challenge to real-time applications such as robot control. In contrast, MoEs effectively address the aforementioned issues while retaining the ability to represent complex distributions but are notoriously difficult to train. VDD is the first method that distills pre-trained diffusion models into MoE models, and hence, combines the expressiveness of Diffusion Models with the benefits of Mixture Models. Specifically, VDD leverages a decompositional upper bound of the variational objective that allows the training of each expert separately, resulting in a robust optimization scheme for MoEs. VDD demonstrates across nine complex behavior learning tasks, that it is able to: i) accurately distill complex distributions learned by the diffusion model, ii) outperform existing state-of-the-art distillation methods, and iii) surpass conventional methods for training MoE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 38th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems,</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Pose Diffuser: A Multimodal Generative Conditional Pose Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14540v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model plays a crucial role in 3D human pose estimation, providing a streamlined yet effective representation of the human body. However, ensuring the validity of SMPL configurations during tasks such as human mesh regression remains a significant challenge , highlighting the necessity for a robust human pose prior capable of discerning realistic human poses. To address this, we introduce MOPED: \underline{M}ulti-m\underline{O}dal \underline{P}os\underline{E} \underline{D}iffuser. MOPED is the first method to leverage a novel multi-modal conditional diffusion model as a prior for SMPL pose parameters. Our method offers powerful unconditional pose generation with the ability to condition on multi-modal inputs such as images and text. This capability enhances the applicability of our approach by incorporating additional context often overlooked in traditional pose priors. Extensive experiments across three distinct tasks-pose estimation, pose denoising, and pose completion-demonstrate that our multi-modal diffusion model-based prior significantly outperforms existing methods. These results indicate that our model captures a broader spectrum of plausible human poses.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEAD: Latent Realignment for Human Motion Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14508v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our goal is to generate realistic human motion from natural language. Modern methods often face a trade-off between model expressiveness and text-to-motion alignment. Some align text and motion latent spaces but sacrifice expressiveness; others rely on diffusion models producing impressive motions, but lacking semantic meaning in their latent space. This may compromise realism, diversity, and applicability. Here, we address this by combining latent diffusion with a realignment mechanism, producing a novel, semantically structured space that encodes the semantics of language. Leveraging this capability, we introduce the task of textual motion inversion to capture novel motion concepts from a few examples. For motion synthesis, we evaluate LEAD on HumanML3D and KIT-ML and show comparable performance to the state-of-the-art in terms of realism, diversity, and text-motion consistency. Our qualitative analysis and user study reveal that our synthesized motions are sharper, more human-like and comply better with the text compared to modern methods. For motion textual inversion, our method demonstrates improved capacity in capturing out-of-distribution characteristics in comparison to traditional VAEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ANT: Adaptive Noise Schedule for Time Series Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14488v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in diffusion models for generative artificial intelligence have recently propagated to the time series (TS) domain, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, prior works on TS diffusion models often borrow the framework of existing works proposed in other domains without considering the characteristics of TS data, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose Adaptive Noise schedule for Time series diffusion models (ANT), which automatically predetermines proper noise schedules for given TS datasets based on their statistics representing non-stationarity. Our intuition is that an optimal noise schedule should satisfy the following desiderata: 1) It linearly reduces the non-stationarity of TS data so that all diffusion steps are equally meaningful, 2) the data is corrupted to the random noise at the final step, and 3) the number of steps is sufficiently large. The proposed method is practical for use in that it eliminates the necessity of finding the optimal noise schedule with a small additional cost to compute the statistics for given datasets, which can be done offline before training. We validate the effectiveness of our method across various tasks, including TS forecasting, refinement, and generation, on datasets from diverse domains.

| **[DRL Optimization Trajectory Generation via Wireless Network Intent-Guided Diffusion Models for Optimizing Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14481v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancements in wireless communication fields, including low-altitude economies, 6G, and Wi-Fi, the scale of wireless networks continues to expand, accompanied by increasing service quality demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization models can improve network performance by solving non-convex optimization problems intelligently. However, they heavily rely on online deployment and often require extensive initial training. Online DRL optimization models typically make accurate decisions based on current channel state distributions. When these distributions change, their generalization capability diminishes, which hinders the responsiveness essential for real-time and high-reliability wireless communication networks. Furthermore, different users have varying quality of service (QoS) requirements across diverse scenarios, and conventional online DRL methods struggle to accommodate this variability. Consequently, exploring flexible and customized AI strategies is critical. We propose a wireless network intent (WNI)-guided trajectory generation model based on a generative diffusion model (GDM). This model can be generated and fine-tuned in real time to achieve the objective and meet the constraints of target intent networks, significantly reducing state information exposure during wireless communication. Moreover, The WNI-guided optimization trajectory generation can be customized to address differentiated QoS requirements, enhancing the overall quality of communication in future intelligent networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves greater stability in spectral efficiency variations and outperforms traditional DRL optimization models in dynamic communication systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces score-based iterative reconstruction (SIR), an efficient and general algorithm mimicking a differentiable 3D reconstruction process to reduce the NFEs and enable optimization in pixel space. Given a single set of images sampled from a multi-view score-based diffusion model, SIR repeatedly optimizes 3D parameters, unlike the single-step optimization in SDS. With other improvements in training, we present an efficient approach called MicroDreamer that generally applies to various 3D representations and 3D generation tasks. In particular, MicroDreamer is 5-20 times faster than SDS in generating neural radiance field while retaining a comparable performance and takes about 20 seconds to create meshes from 3D Gaussian splatting on a single A100 GPU, halving the time of the fastest optimization-based baseline DreamGaussian with significantly superior performance compared to the measurement standard deviation.

Rendering algorithms decompose and simulate the imaging process of a camera, while are limited by the accuracy of modeled variables and the efficiency of computation. Generative models can produce impressively vivid human images, however still lacking in controllability and editability. This paper studies photorealism enhancement of rendered images, leveraging generative power from diffusion models on the controlled basis of rendering. We introduce a novel framework to translate rendered images into their realistic counterparts, which consists of two stages: Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI) and Realistic Image Generation (RIG). In DKI, we adopt positive (real) domain finetuning and negative (rendered) domain embedding to inject knowledge into a pretrained Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. In RIG, we generate the realistic image corresponding to the input rendered image, with a Texture-preserving Attention Control (TAC) to preserve fine-grained clothing textures, exploiting the decoupled features encoded in the UNet structure. Additionally, we introduce SynFashion dataset, featuring high-quality digital clothing images with diverse textures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method in rendered-to-real image translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Negative Guidance of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14398v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negative Prompting (NP) is widely utilized in diffusion models, particularly in text-to-image applications, to prevent the generation of undesired features. In this paper, we show that conventional NP is limited by the assumption of a constant guidance scale, which may lead to highly suboptimal results, or even complete failure, due to the non-stationarity and state-dependence of the reverse process. Based on this analysis, we derive a principled technique called Dynamic Negative Guidance, which relies on a near-optimal time and state dependent modulation of the guidance without requiring additional training. Unlike NP, negative guidance requires estimating the posterior class probability during the denoising process, which is achieved with limited additional computational overhead by tracking the discrete Markov Chain during the generative process. We evaluate the performance of DNG class-removal on MNIST and CIFAR10, where we show that DNG leads to higher safety, preservation of class balance and image quality when compared with baseline methods. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to use DNG with Stable Diffusion to obtain more accurate and less invasive guidance than NP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper currently under review.

Existing methods still struggle in complex layout generation, where common bad cases include object missing, inconsistent lighting, conflicting view angles, etc. To effectively address these issues, we propose a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{Co}ntrollable (HiCo) diffusion model for layout-to-image generation, featuring object seperable conditioning branch structure. Our key insight is to achieve spatial disentanglement through hierarchical modeling of layouts. We use a multi branch structure to represent hierarchy and aggregate them in fusion module. To evaluate the performance of multi-objective controllable layout generation in natural scenes, we introduce the HiCo-7K benchmark, derived from the GRIT-20M dataset and manually cleaned. https://github.com/360CVGroup/HiCo_T2I.</p></details> | NeurIPS2024 |
| **[Mitigating Embedding Collapse in Diffusion Models for Categorical Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14758v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have enabled continuous-state diffusion models to handle a variety of datasets, including categorical data. However, most methods rely on fixed pretrained embeddings, limiting the benefits of joint training with the diffusion model. While jointly learning the embedding (via reconstruction loss) and the latent diffusion model (via score matching loss) could enhance performance, our analysis shows that end-to-end training risks embedding collapse, degrading generation quality. To address this issue, we introduce CATDM, a continuous diffusion framework within the embedding space that stabilizes training. We propose a novel objective combining the joint embedding-diffusion variational lower bound with a Consistency-Matching (CM) regularizer, alongside a shifted cosine noise schedule and random dropping strategy. The CM regularizer ensures the recovery of the true data distribution. Experiments on benchmarks show that CATDM mitigates embedding collapse, yielding superior results on FFHQ, LSUN Churches, and LSUN Bedrooms. In particular, CATDM achieves an FID of 6.81 on ImageNet $256\times256$ with 50 steps. It outperforms non-autoregressive models in machine translation and is on a par with previous methods in text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClearSR: Latent Low-Resolution Image Embeddings Help Diffusion-Based Real-World Super Resolution Models See Clearer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14279v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ClearSR, a new method that can better take advantage of latent low-resolution image (LR) embeddings for diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR). Previous Real-ISR models mostly focus on how to activate more generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models to make the output high-resolution (HR) images look better. However, since these methods rely too much on the generative priors, the content of the output images is often inconsistent with the input LR ones. To mitigate the above issue, in this work, we explore using latent LR embeddings to constrain the control signals from ControlNet, and extract LR information at both detail and structure levels. We show that the proper use of latent LR embeddings can produce higher-quality control signals, which enables the super-resolution results to be more consistent with the LR image and leads to clearer visual results. In addition, we also show that latent LR embeddings can be used to control the inference stage, allowing for the improvement of fidelity and generation ability simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance across multiple metrics on several test sets and generate more consistent SR results with LR images than existing methods. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

A robust diffusion model is determined by its ability to perform near-perfect reconstruction of certain product outcomes given few related input samples. Unfortunately, the current prominent diffusion-based finetuning technique falls short in maintaining the foreground object consistency while being constrained to produce diverse backgrounds in the image outcome. In the worst scenario, the overfitting issue may occur, meaning that the foreground object is less controllable due to the condition above, for example, the input prompt information is transferred ambiguously to both foreground and background regions, instead of the supposed background region only. To tackle the issues above, we proposed Hypnos, a highly precise foreground-focused diffusion finetuning technique. On the image level, this strategy works best for inanimate object generation tasks, and to do so, Hypnos implements two main approaches, namely: (i) a content-centric prompting strategy and (ii) the utilization of our additional foreground-focused discriminative module. The utilized module is connected with the diffusion model and finetuned with our proposed set of supervision mechanism. Combining the strategies above yielded to the foreground-background disentanglement capability of the diffusion model. Our experimental results showed that the proposed strategy gave a more robust performance and visually pleasing results compared to the former technique. For better elaborations, we also provided extensive studies to assess the fruitful outcomes above, which reveal how personalization behaves in regard to several training conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures, to appear on the Rich Media with Generative AI workshop in conjunction with Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2024</p></details> |
| **[ERDDCI: Exact Reversible Diffusion via Dual-Chain Inversion for High-Quality Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14247v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have been successfully applied to real image editing. These models typically invert images into latent noise vectors used to reconstruct the original images (known as inversion), and then edit them during the inference process. However, recent popular DMs often rely on the assumption of local linearization, where the noise injected during the inversion process is expected to approximate the noise removed during the inference process. While DM efficiently generates images under this assumption, it can also accumulate errors during the diffusion process due to the assumption, ultimately negatively impacting the quality of real image reconstruction and editing. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, referred to as ERDDCI (Exact Reversible Diffusion via Dual-Chain Inversion). ERDDCI uses the new Dual-Chain Inversion (DCI) for joint inference to derive an exact reversible diffusion process. By using DCI, our method effectively avoids the cumbersome optimization process in existing inversion approaches and achieves high-quality image editing. Additionally, to accommodate image operations under high guidance scales, we introduce a dynamic control strategy that enables more refined image reconstruction and editing. Our experiments demonstrate that ERDDCI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a 50-step diffusion process. It achieves rapid and precise image reconstruction with an SSIM of 0.999 and an LPIPS of 0.001, and also delivers competitive results in image editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Convergence Analysis for Score-Based Diffusion Models with Deterministic Samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14237v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models have emerged as powerful techniques for generating samples from high-dimensional data distributions. These models involve a two-phase process: first, injecting noise to transform the data distribution into a known prior distribution, and second, sampling to recover the original data distribution from noise. Among the various sampling methods, deterministic samplers stand out for their enhanced efficiency. However, analyzing these deterministic samplers presents unique challenges, as they preclude the use of established techniques such as Girsanov's theorem, which are only applicable to stochastic samplers. Furthermore, existing analysis for deterministic samplers usually focuses on specific examples, lacking a generalized approach for general forward processes and various deterministic samplers. Our paper addresses these limitations by introducing a unified convergence analysis framework. To demonstrate the power of our framework, we analyze the variance-preserving (VP) forward process with the exponential integrator (EI) scheme, achieving iteration complexity of $\tilde O(d^2/\epsilon)$. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM)-type samplers, which have been underexplored in previous research, achieving polynomial iteration complexity.</p></details> | 68 pages |

However, these methods experience a significant performance drop when dealing with unseen objects. We believe that it results from the limited generalizability of image features. To address this problem, we have an in-depth analysis on the features of diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion, which hold substantial potential for modeling unseen objects. Based on this analysis, we then innovatively introduce these diffusion features for object pose estimation. To achieve this, we propose three distinct architectures that can effectively capture and aggregate diffusion features of different granularity, greatly improving the generalizability of object pose estimation. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin on three popular benchmark datasets, LM, O-LM, and T-LESS. In particular, our method achieves higher accuracy than the previous best arts on unseen objects: 97.9% vs. 93.5% on Unseen LM, 85.9% vs. 76.3% on Unseen O-LM, showing the strong generalizability of our method.

ScoreFusion is particularly useful for enhancing the generative modeling of a target population with limited observed data. Our starting point considers the family of KL barycenters of the auxiliary populations, which is proven to be an optimal parametric class in the KL sense, but difficult to learn. Nevertheless, by recasting the learning problem as score matching in denoising diffusion, we obtain a tractable way of computing the optimal KL barycenter weights. We prove a dimension-free sample complexity bound in total variation distance, provided that the auxiliary models are well fitted for their own task and the auxiliary tasks combined capture the target well. We also explain a connection of the practice of checkpoint merging in AI art creation to an approximation of our KL-barycenter-based fusion approach. However, our fusion method differs in key aspects, allowing generation of new populations, as we illustrate in experiments.</p></details> | 53 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Suppress Content Shift: Better Diffusion Features via Off-the-Shelf Generation Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06719v3)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are powerful generative models, and this capability can also be applied to discrimination. The inner activations of a pre-trained diffusion model can serve as features for discriminative tasks, namely, diffusion feature. We discover that diffusion feature has been hindered by a hidden yet universal phenomenon that we call content shift. To be specific, there are content differences between features and the input image, such as the exact shape of a certain object. We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent characteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this phenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that its negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually perceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall quality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the information drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy input, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation techniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a practical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of a technique and provide an implementation of our methodology. Despite the simplicity, the proposed approach has achieved superior results on various tasks and datasets, validating its potential as a generic booster for diffusion features.

Recent research shows that the internal signals within their backbones, named activations, can also serve as dense features for various discriminative tasks such as semantic segmentation. Given numerous activations, selecting a small yet effective subset poses a fundamental problem. To this end, the early study of this field performs a large-scale quantitative comparison of the discriminative ability of the activations. However, we find that many potential activations have not been evaluated, such as the queries and keys used to compute attention scores. Moreover, recent advancements in diffusion architectures bring many new activations, such as those within embedded ViT modules. Both combined, activation selection remains unresolved but overlooked. To tackle this issue, this paper takes a further step with a much broader range of activations evaluated. Considering the significant increase in activations, a full-scale quantitative comparison is no longer operational. Instead, we seek to understand the properties of these activations, such that the activations that are clearly inferior can be filtered out in advance via simple qualitative evaluation. After careful analysis, we discover three properties universal among diffusion models, enabling this study to go beyond specific models. On top of this, we present effective feature selection solutions for several popular diffusion models. Finally, the experiments across multiple discriminative tasks validate the superiority of our method over the SOTA competitors.

Despite the field of explainable AI making strides in interpreting machine learning models, understanding latent variables in generative models remains challenging. This paper introduces \textit{LatentExplainer}, a framework for automatically generating semantically meaningful explanations of latent variables in deep generative models. \textit{LatentExplainer} tackles three main challenges: inferring the meaning of latent variables, aligning explanations with inductive biases, and handling varying degrees of explainability. Our approach perturbs latent variables, interpreting changes in generated data, and uses multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to produce human-understandable explanations. We evaluate our proposed method on several real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance in generating high-quality explanations for latent variables. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating inductive biases and uncertainty quantification, significantly enhancing model interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we show that traditional diffusion and flow-matching models with standard Gaussian priors fail to capture heavy-tailed behavior. We address this by repurposing the diffusion framework for heavy-tail estimation using multivariate Student-t distributions. We develop a tailored perturbation kernel and derive the denoising posterior based on the conditional Student-t distribution for the backward process. Inspired by $\gamma$-divergence for heavy-tailed distributions, we derive a training objective for heavy-tailed denoisers. The resulting framework introduces controllable tail generation using only a single scalar hyperparameter, making it easily tunable for diverse real-world distributions. As specific instantiations of our framework, we introduce t-EDM and t-Flow, extensions of existing diffusion and flow models that employ a Student-t prior. Remarkably, our approach is readily compatible with standard Gaussian diffusion models and requires only minimal code changes. Empirically, we show that our t-EDM and t-Flow outperform standard diffusion models in heavy-tail estimation on high-resolution weather datasets in which generating rare and extreme events is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, Contains GIF animations and is best viewed with a dedicated pdf reader</p></details> |

Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame Avatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models.

However, customizing these models with new classes often leads to unintended consequences that compromise their reliability. We introduce the concept of open-world forgetting to emphasize the vast scope of these unintended alterations, contrasting it with the well-studied closed-world forgetting, which is measurable by evaluating performance on a limited set of classes or skills. Our research presents the first comprehensive investigation into open-world forgetting in diffusion models, focusing on semantic and appearance drift of representations. We utilize zero-shot classification to analyze semantic drift, revealing that even minor model adaptations lead to unpredictable shifts affecting areas far beyond newly introduced concepts, with dramatic drops in zero-shot classification of up to 60%. Additionally, we observe significant changes in texture and color of generated content when analyzing appearance drift. To address these issues, we propose a mitigation strategy based on functional regularization, designed to preserve original capabilities while accommodating new concepts.

| **[Beyond Autoregression: Discrete Diffusion for Complex Reasoning and Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14157v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive language models, despite their impressive capabilities, struggle with complex reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We introduce discrete diffusion models as a novel solution to these challenges. Through the lens of subgoal imbalance, we demonstrate how diffusion models effectively learn difficult subgoals that elude autoregressive approaches. We propose Multi-granularity Diffusion Modeling (MDM), which prioritizes subgoals based on difficulty during learning. On complex tasks like Countdown, Sudoku, and Boolean Satisfiability Problems, MDM significantly outperforms autoregressive models without using search techniques. For instance, MDM achieves 91.5\% and 100\% accuracy on Countdown and Sudoku, respectively, compared to 45.8\% and 20.7\% for autoregressive models. Our work highlights the potential of diffusion-based approaches in advancing AI capabilities for sophisticated language understanding and problem-solving tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Curriculum: Synthetic-to-Real Generative Curriculum Learning via Image-Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13674v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, including references and appendix.

However, traditional AutoML frameworks focus solely on discriminative tasks, often falling short in tackling AutoML for generative models. Additionally, these frameworks lack interpretability and user engagement during the training process, primarily due to the absence of human-centered design. It leads to a lack of transparency in final decision-making and limited user control, potentially reducing trust and adoption of AutoML methods. To address these limitations, we introduce UniAutoML, a human-centered AutoML framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to unify AutoML for both discriminative (e.g., Transformers and CNNs for classification or regression tasks) and generative tasks (e.g., fine-tuning diffusion models or LLMs). The human-centered design of UniAutoML innovatively features a conversational user interface (CUI) that facilitates natural language interactions, providing users with real-time guidance, feedback, and progress updates for better interpretability. This design enhances transparency and user control throughout the AutoML training process, allowing users to seamlessly break down or modify the model being trained. To mitigate potential risks associated with LLM generated content, UniAutoML incorporates a safety guardline that filters inputs and censors outputs. We evaluated UniAutoML's performance and usability through experiments on eight diverse datasets and user studies involving 25 participants, demonstrating that UniAutoML not only enhances performance but also improves user control and trust. Our human-centered design bridges the gap between AutoML capabilities and user understanding, making ML more accessible to a broader audience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extreme Precipitation Nowcasting using Multi-Task Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14103v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have made remarkable strides in precipitation prediction, yet they continue to struggle with capturing the spatial details of the features of radar images, particularly over high precipitation intensity areas. This shortcoming is evident in the form of low forecast accuracy in the spatial positioning of radar echo images across varying precipitation intensity regions. To address this challenge, we introduce the multi-task latent diffusion model(MTLDM), a novel approach for precipitation prediction. The basic concept of the MTLDM is based on the understanding that the radar image representing precipitation is the result of multiple factors. Therefore, we adopt a divide-and-conquer approach, that is, we decompose the radar image using decomposition technology and then predict the decomposed sub-images separately. We conceptualize the precipitation image as a composition of various components corresponding to different precipitation intensities. The MTLDM decomposes the precipitation image into these distinct components and employs a dedicated task to predict each one. This method enables spatiotemporally consistent prediction of real-world precipitation areas up to 5-80 min in advance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6figures |

With the rise of multimodality, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools not only for generative tasks but also for various applications such as image editing, inpainting, and super-resolution. However, these models still lack robustness due to limited research on attacking them to enhance their resilience. Traditional attack techniques, such as gradient-based adversarial attacks and diffusion model-based methods, are hindered by computational inefficiencies and scalability issues due to their iterative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative framework that leverages the distilled backbone of diffusion models and incorporates a precision-optimized noise predictor to enhance the effectiveness of our attack framework. This approach not only enhances the attack's potency but also significantly reduces computational costs. Our framework provides a cutting-edge solution for multi-modal adversarial attacks, ensuring reduced latency and the generation of high-fidelity adversarial examples with superior success rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our framework achieves outstanding transferability and robustness against purification defenses, outperforming existing gradient-based attack models in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiFuseR: A Distributed Sketch-based Influence Maximization Algorithm for GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14047v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence Maximization (IM) aims to find a given number of "seed" vertices that can effectively maximize the expected spread under a given diffusion model. Due to the NP-Hardness of finding an optimal seed set, approximation algorithms are often used for IM. However, these algorithms require a large number of simulations to find good seed sets. In this work, we propose DiFuseR, a blazing-fast, high-quality IM algorithm that can run on multiple GPUs in a distributed setting. DiFuseR is designed to increase GPU utilization, reduce inter-node communication, and minimize overlapping data/computation among the nodes. Based on the experiments with various graphs, containing some of the largest networks available, and diffusion settings, the proposed approach is found to be 3.2x and 12x faster on average on a single GPU and 8 GPUs, respectively. It can achieve up to 8x and 233.7x speedup on the same hardware settings. Furthermore, thanks to its smart load-balancing mechanism, on 8 GPUs, it is on average 5.6x faster compared to its single-GPU performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating Policies from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost - namely, larger model size and slower inference. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (i.e., diffusing trajectories): fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. Thus, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to learn a distribution over policies for robotic tasks, rather than over trajectories. Our approach encodes demonstration trajectories into a latent space and then decodes them into policies using a hypernetwork. We employ a diffusion denoising model within this latent space to learn its distribution. We demonstrate that LWD can reconstruct the behaviors of the original policies that generated the trajectory dataset. LWD offers the benefits of considerably smaller policy networks during inference and requires fewer diffusion model queries. When tested on the Metaworld MT10 benchmark, LWD achieves a higher success rate compared to a vanilla multi-task policy, while using models up to ~18x smaller during inference. Additionally, since LWD generates closed-loop policies, we show that it outperforms Diffusion Policy in long action horizon settings, with reduced diffusion queries during rollout.</p></details> |  |

Current time-resolved inflow reconstruction techniques estimate wind behavior in unobserved regions using relatively simple spectral-based models of the atmosphere. Here, we develop a technique for time-resolved inflow reconstruction that is rooted in a large-eddy simulation model of the atmosphere. Our "large-eddy reconstruction" technique blends observations and atmospheric model information through a diffusion model machine learning algorithm, allowing us to generate probabilistic ensembles of reconstructions for a single 10-min observational period. Our generated inflows can be used directly by aeroelastic codes or as inflow boundary conditions in a large-eddy simulation. We verify the second-by-second reconstruction capability of our technique in three synthetic field campaigns, finding positive Pearson correlation coefficient values (0.20>r>0.85) between ground-truth and reconstructed streamwise velocity, as well as smaller positive correlation coefficient values for unobserved fields (spanwise velocity, vertical velocity, and temperature). We validate our technique in three real-world case studies by driving large-eddy simulations with reconstructed inflows and comparing to independent inflow measurements. The reconstructions are visually similar to measurements, follow desired power spectra properties, and track second-by-second behavior (0.25 > r > 0.75).</p></details> | 30 pages, 15 figures |

Using only egocentric SLAM poses and images, EgoAllo guides sampling from a conditional diffusion model to estimate 3D body pose, height, and hand parameters that capture the wearer's actions in the allocentric coordinate frame of the scene. To achieve this, our key insight is in representation: we propose spatial and temporal invariance criteria for improving model performance, from which we derive a head motion conditioning parameterization that improves estimation by up to 18%. We also show how the bodies estimated by our system can improve the hands: the resulting kinematic and temporal constraints result in over 40% lower hand estimation errors compared to noisy monocular estimates.

| **[Vision-Language-Action Model and Diffusion Policy Switching Enables Dexterous Control of an Anthropomorphic Hand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14022v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To advance autonomous dexterous manipulation, we propose a hybrid control method that combines the relative advantages of a fine-tuned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and diffusion models. The VLA model provides language commanded high-level planning, which is highly generalizable, while the diffusion model handles low-level interactions which offers the precision and robustness required for specific objects and environments. By incorporating a switching signal into the training-data, we enable event based transitions between these two models for a pick-and-place task where the target object and placement location is commanded through language. This approach is deployed on our anthropomorphic ADAPT Hand 2, a 13DoF robotic hand, which incorporates compliance through series elastic actuation allowing for resilience for any interactions: showing the first use of a multi-fingered hand controlled with a VLA model. We demonstrate this model switching approach results in a over 80\% success rate compared to under 40\% when only using a VLA model, enabled by accurate near-object arm motion by the VLA model and a multi-modal grasping motion with error recovery abilities from the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Graph Data Scaling: A Showcase with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01899v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models for natural language and images benefit from data scaling behavior: the more data fed into the model, the better they perform. This 'better with more' phenomenon enables the effectiveness of large-scale pre-training on vast amounts of data. However, current graph pre-training methods struggle to scale up data due to heterogeneity across graphs. To achieve effective data scaling, we aim to develop a general model that is able to capture diverse data patterns of graphs and can be utilized to adaptively help the downstream tasks. To this end, we propose UniAug, a universal graph structure augmentor built on a diffusion model. We first pre-train a discrete diffusion model on thousands of graphs across domains to learn the graph structural patterns. In the downstream phase, we provide adaptive enhancement by conducting graph structure augmentation with the help of the pre-trained diffusion model via guided generation. By leveraging the pre-trained diffusion model for structure augmentation, we consistently achieve performance improvements across various downstream tasks in a plug-and-play manner. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first demonstration of a data-scaling graph structure augmentor on graphs across domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Diffusion Models for Multi-Agent Partial Observability: Shared Attractors, Error Bounds, and Composite Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13953v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiagent systems grapple with partial observability (PO), and the decentralized POMDP (Dec-POMDP) model highlights the fundamental nature of this challenge. Whereas recent approaches to address PO have appealed to deep learning models, providing a rigorous understanding of how these models and their approximation errors affect agents' handling of PO and their interactions remain a challenge. In addressing this challenge, we investigate reconstructing global states from local action-observation histories in Dec-POMDPs using diffusion models. We first find that diffusion models conditioned on local history represent possible states as stable fixed points. In collectively observable (CO) Dec-POMDPs, individual diffusion models conditioned on agents' local histories share a unique fixed point corresponding to the global state, while in non-CO settings, the shared fixed points yield a distribution of possible states given joint history. We further find that, with deep learning approximation errors, fixed points can deviate from true states and the deviation is negatively correlated to the Jacobian rank. Inspired by this low-rank property, we bound the deviation by constructing a surrogate linear regression model that approximates the local behavior of diffusion models. With this bound, we propose a composite diffusion process iterating over agents with theoretical convergence guarantees to the true state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusing States and Matching Scores: A New Framework for Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13855v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial Imitation Learning is traditionally framed as a two-player zero-sum game between a learner and an adversarially chosen cost function, and can therefore be thought of as the sequential generalization of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). A prominent example of this framework is Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). However, in recent years, diffusion models have emerged as a non-adversarial alternative to GANs that merely require training a score function via regression, yet produce generations of a higher quality. In response, we investigate how to lift insights from diffusion modeling to the sequential setting. We propose diffusing states and performing score-matching along diffused states to measure the discrepancy between the expert's and learner's states. Thus, our approach only requires training score functions to predict noises via standard regression, making it significantly easier and more stable to train than adversarial methods. Theoretically, we prove first- and second-order instance-dependent bounds with linear scaling in the horizon, proving that our approach avoids the compounding errors that stymie offline approaches to imitation learning. Empirically, we show our approach outperforms GAN-style imitation learning baselines across various continuous control problems, including complex tasks like controlling humanoids to walk, sit, and crawl.</p></details> |  |
| **[Influence Functions for Scalable Data Attribution in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13850v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have led to significant advancements in generative modelling. Yet their widespread adoption poses challenges regarding data attribution and interpretability. In this paper, we aim to help address such challenges in diffusion models by developing an \textit{influence functions} framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

Beyond mere data augmentation, our research in this paper highlights an additional, significant capacity of deep generative models: their ability to reveal and demonstrate patterns in medical images. We employ a generative structure with hybrid conditions, combining clinical data and segmentation masks to guide the image synthesis process. Furthermore, we innovatively transformed the tabular clinical data into textual descriptions. This approach simplifies the handling of missing values and also enables us to leverage large pre-trained vision-language models that investigate the relations between independent clinical entries and comprehend general terms, such as gender and smoking status. Our approach differs from and presents a more challenging task than traditional medical report-guided synthesis due to the less visual correlation of our clinical information with the images. To overcome this, we introduce a text-visual embedding mechanism that strengthens the conditions, ensuring the network effectively utilizes the provided information. Our pipeline is generalizable to both GAN-based and diffusion models. Experiments on chest CT, particularly focusing on the smoking status, demonstrated a consistent intensity shift in the lungs which is in agreement with clinical observations, indicating the effectiveness of our method in capturing and visualizing the impact of specific attributes on medical image patterns. Our methods offer a new avenue for the early detection and precise visualization of complex clinical conditions with deep generative models.

In particular, pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models provide strong generative priors to reconstruct credible and intricate details. However, T2I generation focuses on semantic consistency while Real-ISR emphasizes pixel-level reconstruction, which hinders existing methods from fully exploiting diffusion priors. To address this challenge, we introduce ConsisSR to handle both semantic and pixel-level consistency. Specifically, compared to coarse-grained text prompts, we exploit the more powerful CLIP image embedding and effectively leverage both modalities through our Hybrid Prompt Adapter (HPA) for semantic guidance. Secondly, we introduce Time-aware Latent Augmentation (TALA) to mitigate the inherent gap between T2I generation and Real-ISR consistency requirements. By randomly mixing LQ and HQ latent inputs, our model not only handle timestep-specific diffusion noise but also refine the accumulated latent representations. Last but not least, our GAN-Embedding strategy employs the pretrained Real-ESRGAN model to refine the diffusion start point. This accelerates the inference process to 10 steps while preserving sampling quality, in a training-free manner. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among both full-scale and accelerated models. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Latent Hierarchical Structure of Data via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13770v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional data must be highly structured to be learnable. Although the compositional and hierarchical nature of data is often put forward to explain learnability, quantitative measurements establishing these properties are scarce. Likewise, accessing the latent variables underlying such a data structure remains a challenge. In this work, we show that forward-backward experiments in diffusion-based models, where data is noised and then denoised to generate new samples, are a promising tool to probe the latent structure of data. We predict in simple hierarchical models that, in this process, changes in data occur by correlated chunks, with a length scale that diverges at a noise level where a phase transition is known to take place. Remarkably, we confirm this prediction in both text and image datasets using state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our results show how latent variable changes manifest in the data and establish how to measure these effects in real data using diffusion models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Yet, despite recent advances in deep learning, existing models cannot generate molecules that satisfy all desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we describe IDOLpro, a generative chemistry AI combining diffusion with multi-objective optimization for structure-based drug design. Differentiable scoring functions guide the latent variables of the diffusion model to explore uncharted chemical space and generate novel ligands in silico, optimizing a plurality of target physicochemical properties. We demonstrate our platform's effectiveness by generating ligands with optimized binding affinity and synthetic accessibility on two benchmark sets. IDOLpro produces ligands with binding affinities over 10%-20% better than the next best state-of-the-art method on each test set, producing more drug-like molecules with generally better synthetic accessibility scores than other methods. We do a head-to-head comparison of IDOLpro against a classic virtual screen of a large database of drug-like molecules. We show that IDOLpro can generate molecules for a range of important disease-related targets with better binding affinity and synthetic accessibility than any molecule found in the virtual screen while being over 100x faster and less expensive to run. On a test set of experimental complexes, IDOLpro is the first to produce molecules with better binding affinities than experimentally observed ligands. IDOLpro can accommodate other scoring functions (e.g. ADME-Tox) to accelerate hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization for drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theory on Score-Mismatched Diffusion Models and Zero-Shot Conditional Samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13746v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The denoising diffusion model has recently emerged as a powerful generative technique, capable of transforming noise into meaningful data. While theoretical convergence guarantees for diffusion models are well established when the target distribution aligns with the training distribution, practical scenarios often present mismatches. One common case is in zero-shot conditional diffusion sampling, where the target conditional distribution is different from the (unconditional) training distribution. These score-mismatched diffusion models remain largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we present the first performance guarantee with explicit dimensional dependencies for general score-mismatched diffusion samplers, focusing on target distributions with finite second moments. We show that score mismatches result in an asymptotic distributional bias between the target and sampling distributions, proportional to the accumulated mismatch between the target and training distributions. This result can be directly applied to zero-shot conditional samplers for any conditional model, irrespective of measurement noise. Interestingly, the derived convergence upper bound offers useful guidance for designing a novel bias-optimal zero-shot sampler in linear conditional models that minimizes the asymptotic bias. For such bias-optimal samplers, we further establish convergence guarantees with explicit dependencies on dimension and conditioning, applied to several interesting target distributions, including those with bounded support and Gaussian mixtures. Our findings are supported by numerical studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Convergence Rate for Diffusion Probabilistic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13738v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable empirical performance in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence for their ability to generate high-quality new data instances from complex distributions. Improving our understanding of diffusion models, including mainly convergence analysis for such models, has attracted a lot of interests. Despite a lot of theoretical attempts, there still exists significant gap between theory and practice. Towards to close this gap, we establish an iteration complexity at the order of $d^{1/3}\varepsilon^{-2/3}$, which is better than $d^{5/12}\varepsilon^{-1}$, the best known complexity achieved before our work. This convergence analysis is based on a randomized midpoint method, which is first proposed for log-concave sampling (Shen and Lee, 2019), and then extended to diffusion models by Gupta et al. (2024). Our theory accommodates $\varepsilon$-accurate score estimates, and does not require log-concavity on the target distribution. Moreover, the algorithm can also be parallelized to run in only $O(\log^2(d/\varepsilon))$ parallel rounds in a similar way to prior works.</p></details> | 20 pages |

In the context of this reality, existing diffusion models, such as Diffusion Transformers, often face challenges when processing image resolutions outside of their trained domain. To address this limitation, we conceptualize images as sequences of tokens with dynamic sizes, rather than traditional methods that perceive images as fixed-resolution grids. This perspective enables a flexible training strategy that seamlessly accommodates various aspect ratios during both training and inference, thus promoting resolution generalization and eliminating biases introduced by image cropping. On this basis, we present the \textbf{Flexible Vision Transformer} (FiT), a transformer architecture specifically designed for generating images with \textit{unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios}. We further upgrade the FiT to FiTv2 with several innovative designs, includingthe Query-Key vector normalization, the AdaLN-LoRA module, a rectified flow scheduler, and a Logit-Normal sampler. Enhanced by a meticulously adjusted network structure, FiTv2 exhibits $2\times$ convergence speed of FiT. When incorporating advanced training-free extrapolation techniques, FiTv2 demonstrates remarkable adaptability in both resolution extrapolation and diverse resolution generation. Additionally, our exploration of the scalability of the FiTv2 model reveals that larger models exhibit better computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient post-training strategy to adapt a pre-trained model for the high-resolution generation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the exceptional performance of FiTv2 across a broad range of resolutions. We have released all the codes and models at \url{https://github.com/whlzy/FiT} to promote the exploration of diffusion transformer models for arbitrary-resolution image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.12376</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Tuning Discrete Diffusion Models via Reward Optimization with Applications to DNA and Protein Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13643v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the strong empirical performance of diffusion models on discrete sequences across domains from natural language to biological sequence generation. For example, in the protein inverse folding task, conditional diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating natural-like sequences that fold back into the original structure. However, practical design tasks often require not only modeling a conditional distribution but also optimizing specific task objectives. For instance, we may prefer protein sequences with high stability. To address this, we consider the scenario where we have pre-trained discrete diffusion models that can generate natural-like sequences, as well as reward models that map sequences to task objectives. We then formulate the reward maximization problem within discrete diffusion models, analogous to reinforcement learning (RL), while minimizing the KL divergence against pretrained diffusion models to preserve naturalness. To solve this RL problem, we propose a novel algorithm, DRAKES, that enables direct backpropagation of rewards through entire trajectories generated by diffusion models, by making the originally non-differentiable trajectories differentiable using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our theoretical analysis indicates that our approach can generate sequences that are both natural-like and yield high rewards. While similar tasks have been recently explored in diffusion models for continuous domains, our work addresses unique algorithmic and theoretical challenges specific to discrete diffusion models, which arise from their foundation in continuous-time Markov chains rather than Brownian motion. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRAKES in generating DNA and protein sequences that optimize enhancer activity and protein stability, respectively, important tasks for gene therapies and protein-based therapeutics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Aligned Diffusion Planner for Quadrupedal Locomotion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13586v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex distributions from large-scale datasets, providing a promising solution for quadrupedal locomotion control. However, offline policy is sensitive to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) states due to the limited state coverage in the datasets. In this work, we propose a two-stage learning framework combining offline learning and online preference alignment for legged locomotion control. Through the offline stage, the diffusion planner learns the joint distribution of state-action sequences from expert datasets without using reward labels. Subsequently, we perform the online interaction in the simulation environment based on the trained offline planer, which significantly addresses the OOD issues and improves the robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel weak preference labeling method without the ground-truth reward or human preferences. The proposed method exhibits superior stability and velocity tracking accuracy in pacing, trotting, and bounding gait under both slow- and high-speed scenarios and can perform zero-shot transfer to the real Unitree Go1 robots.

| **[Context-Aware Full Body Anonymization using Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08551v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anonymization plays a key role in protecting sensible information of individuals in real world datasets. Self-driving cars for example need high resolution facial features to track people and their viewing direction to predict future behaviour and react accordingly. In order to protect people's privacy whilst keeping important features in the dataset, it is important to replace the full body of a person with a highly detailed anonymized one. In contrast to doing face anonymization, full body replacement decreases the ability of recognizing people by their hairstyle or clothes. In this paper, we propose a workflow for full body person anonymization utilizing Stable Diffusion as a generative backend. Text-to-image diffusion models, like Stable Diffusion, OpenAI's DALL-E or Midjourney, have become very popular in recent time, being able to create photorealistic images from a single text prompt. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the art anonymization pipelines with respect to image quality, resolution, Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Additionally, our method is invariant with respect to the image generator and thus able to be used with the latest models available.</p></details> |  |

However, training MedVLP models typically requires large-scale datasets with paired, high-quality image-text data, which are scarce in the medical domain. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models have made it possible to generate large-scale synthetic image-text pairs. This raises the question: *Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data?* To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective. Our results show that MedVLP models trained *exclusively on synthetic data* outperform those trained on real data by **3.8%** in averaged AUC on zero-shot classification. Moreover, using a combination of synthetic and real data leads to a further improvement of **9.07%**. Additionally, MedVLP models trained on synthetic or mixed data consistently outperform those trained on real data in zero-shot grounding, as well as in fine-tuned classification and segmentation tasks. Our analysis suggests MedVLP trained on well-designed synthetic data can outperform models trained on real datasets, which may be limited by low-quality samples and long-tailed distributions.</p></details> | Under Review |

The focus of this study is taken to be Taiwan, an area very vulnerable to typhoons. By comparing the performance of Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CDDPM) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), results suggest that the CDDPM performs best in generating accurate and realistic meteorological data. Specifically, CDDPM achieved a PSNR of 32.807, which is approximately 7.9% higher than CNN and 5.5% higher than SENet. Furthermore, CDDPM recorded an RMSE of 0.032, showing a 11.1% improvement over CNN and 8.6% improvement over SENet. A key application of this research can be for imputation purposes in missing meteorological datasets and generate additional high-quality meteorological data using satellite images. It is hoped that the results of this analysis will enable more robust and detailed forecasting, reducing the impact of severe weather events on vulnerable regions.

| **[Solving Prior Distribution Mismatch in Diffusion Models via Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13431v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the knowledge surrounding diffusion models(DMs) has grown significantly, though several theoretical gaps remain. Particularly noteworthy is prior error, defined as the discrepancy between the termination distribution of the forward process and the initial distribution of the reverse process. To address these deficiencies, this paper explores the deeper relationship between optimal transport(OT) theory and DMs with discrete initial distribution. Specifically, we demonstrate that the two stages of DMs fundamentally involve computing time-dependent OT. However, unavoidable prior error result in deviation during the reverse process under quadratic transport cost. By proving that as the diffusion termination time increases, the probability flow exponentially converges to the gradient of the solution to the classical Monge-Amp\`ere equation, we establish a vital link between these fields. Therefore, static OT emerges as the most intrinsic single-step method for bridging this theoretical potential gap. Additionally, we apply these insights to accelerate sampling in both unconditional and conditional generation scenarios. Experimental results across multiple image datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches can replicate a given concept by learning from reference images, yet they lack the flexibility for fine-grained customization of the individual component within the concept. In this paper, we introduce component-controllable personalization, a novel task that pushes the boundaries of T2I models by allowing users to reconfigure specific components when personalizing visual concepts. This task is particularly challenging due to two primary obstacles: semantic pollution, where unwanted visual elements corrupt the personalized concept, and semantic imbalance, which causes disproportionate learning of the concept and component. To overcome these challenges, we design MagicTailor, an innovative framework that leverages Dynamic Masked Degradation (DM-Deg) to dynamically perturb undesired visual semantics and Dual-Stream Balancing (DS-Bal) to establish a balanced learning paradigm for desired visual semantics. Extensive comparisons, ablations, and analyses demonstrate that MagicTailor not only excels in this challenging task but also holds significant promise for practical applications, paving the way for more nuanced and creative image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://correr-zhou.github.io/MagicTailor</p></details> |

Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)~\textit{~The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple datasets, different missing scenarios and missing ratios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |

Contrary to the Shannon entropy, the general form of Tsallis entropy renders the optimal policy not necessary a Gibbs measure, where the Lagrange and KKT multipliers naturally arise from some constraints to ensure the learnt policy to be a probability density function. As a consequence, the characterization of the optimal policy using the q-function also involves a Lagrange multiplier. In response, we establish the martingale characterization of the q-function under Tsallis entropy and devise two q-learning algorithms depending on whether the Lagrange multiplier can be derived explicitly or not. In the latter case, we need to consider different parameterizations of the optimal q-function and the optimal policy and update them alternatively in an Actor-Critic manner. We also study two financial applications, namely, an optimal portfolio liquidation problem and a non-LQ control problem. It is interesting to see therein that the optimal policies under the Tsallis entropy regularization can be characterized explicitly, which are distributions concentrated on some compact support. The satisfactory performance of our q-learning algorithms is illustrated in each example.</p></details> |  |

A critical concern regarding these models is their performance on out-of-distribution tasks, which remains an under-explored challenge. Using a diffusion model on an out-of-distribution dataset, realistic reconstructions can be generated, but with hallucinating image features that are uniquely present in the training dataset. To address this discrepancy during train-test time and improve reconstruction accuracy, we introduce a novel sampling framework called Steerable Conditional Diffusion. Specifically, this framework adapts the diffusion model, concurrently with image reconstruction, based solely on the information provided by the available measurement. Utilising our proposed method, we achieve substantial enhancements in out-of-distribution performance across diverse imaging modalities, advancing the robust deployment of denoising diffusion models in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research on UI/UX automation often requires high-fidelity inputs like Figma designs or detailed screenshots, limiting accessibility and impeding efficient design iteration. To bridge this gap, we introduce Sketch2Code, a benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art Vision Language Models (VLMs) on automating the conversion of rudimentary sketches into webpage prototypes. Beyond end-to-end benchmarking, Sketch2Code supports interactive agent evaluation that mimics real-world design workflows, where a VLM-based agent iteratively refines its generations by communicating with a simulated user, either passively receiving feedback instructions or proactively asking clarification questions. We comprehensively analyze ten commercial and open-source models, showing that Sketch2Code is challenging for existing VLMs; even the most capable models struggle to accurately interpret sketches and formulate effective questions that lead to steady improvement. Nevertheless, a user study with UI/UX experts reveals a significant preference for proactive question-asking over passive feedback reception, highlighting the need to develop more effective paradigms for multi-turn conversational agents.</p></details> | preprint, 9 pages |

However, current training recipes lack robust CoT reasoning data, relying on datasets dominated by short annotations with minimal rationales. In this work, we show that training VLM on short answers does not generalize well to reasoning tasks that require more detailed responses. To address this, we propose a two-fold approach. First, we distill rationales from GPT-4o model to enrich the training data and fine-tune VLMs, boosting their CoT performance. Second, we apply reinforcement learning to further calibrate reasoning quality. Specifically, we construct positive (correct) and negative (incorrect) pairs of model-generated reasoning chains, by comparing their predictions with annotated short answers. Using this pairwise data, we apply the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm to refine the model's reasoning abilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in CoT reasoning on benchmark datasets and better generalization to direct answer prediction as well. This work emphasizes the importance of incorporating detailed rationales in training and leveraging reinforcement learning to strengthen the reasoning capabilities of VLMs.</p></details> | 10 pages + appendix |

However, their proficiency in spatial reasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving navigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, much of the spatial reasoning in these tasks occurs in two-dimensional (2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlessly at a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2D spatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model on basic spatial capabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatial reasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that fine-tunes VLMs on these three basic spatial capabilities by synthetic data generation and targeted supervision to form an instruction dataset for each capability. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significant performance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also in generalizing to composite and out-of-distribution spatial reasoning tasks (e.g., improving from 13.5% to 40.0% on the shortest path problem). These findings underscore the effectiveness of mastering basic spatial capabilities in enhancing composite spatial problem-solving, offering insights for improving VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, they suffer from object hallucination, a phenomenon where LVLMs are prone to generate textual responses not factually aligned with image inputs. Our pilot study reveals that object hallucination is closely tied with Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), a widely adopted positional dependency modeling design in existing LVLMs. Due to the long-term decay in RoPE, LVLMs tend to hallucinate more when relevant visual cues are distant from instruction tokens in the multimodal input sequence. Additionally, we observe a similar effect when reversing the sequential order of visual tokens during multimodal alignment. Our tests indicate that long-term decay in RoPE poses challenges to LVLMs while capturing visual-instruction interactions across long distances. We propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), a simple yet effective positional alignment strategy that mitigates the impact of RoPE long-term decay in LVLMs by naturally reducing relative distance between visual and instruction tokens. With CCA, visual tokens can better interact with instruction tokens, thereby enhancing model's perception capability and alleviating object hallucination. Without bells and whistles, our positional alignment method surpasses existing hallucination mitigation strategies by large margins on multiple object hallucination benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at NeurIPS 2024.

In digital pathology, vision-language models (VLM), pre-trained on curated datasets of histological image-captions, have been adapted to downstream tasks, such as region of interest classification. Zero-shot transfer for slide-level prediction has been formulated by MI-Zero, but it exhibits high variability depending on the textual prompts. Inspired by prototypical learning, we propose MI-VisionShot, a training-free adaptation method on top of VLMs to predict slide-level labels in few-shot learning scenarios. Our framework takes advantage of the excellent representation learning of VLM to create prototype-based classifiers under a multiple-instance setting by retrieving the most discriminative patches within each slide. Experimentation through different settings shows the ability of MI-VisionShot to surpass zero-shot transfer with lower variability, even in low-shot scenarios.

| **[Task-oriented Robotic Manipulation with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15863v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) play a crucial role in robotic manipulation by enabling robots to understand and interpret the visual properties of objects and their surroundings, allowing them to perform manipulation based on this multimodal understanding. However, understanding object attributes and spatial relationships is a non-trivial task but is critical in robotic manipulation tasks. In this work, we present a new dataset focused on spatial relationships and attribute assignment and a novel method to utilize VLMs to perform object manipulation with task-oriented, high-level input. In this dataset, the spatial relationships between objects are manually described as captions. Additionally, each object is labeled with multiple attributes, such as fragility, mass, material, and transparency, derived from a fine-tuned vision language model. The embedded object information from captions are automatically extracted and transformed into a data structure (in this case, tree, for demonstration purposes) that captures the spatial relationships among the objects within each image. The tree structures, along with the object attributes, are then fed into a language model to transform into a new tree structure that determines how these objects should be organized in order to accomplish a specific (high-level) task. We demonstrate that our method not only improves the comprehension of spatial relationships among objects in the visual environment but also enables robots to interact with these objects more effectively. As a result, this approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning in robotic manipulation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first method of its kind in the literature, offering a novel solution that allows robots to more efficiently organize and utilize objects in their surroundings.</p></details> |  |

However, as they often feature non-standard projections, hand-drawn styles, and artistic elements, it is challenging for non-experts to identify and interpret them. While existing image captioning methods have achieved remarkable success on natural images, their performance on maps is suboptimal as maps are underrepresented in their pre-training process. Despite the recent advance of GPT-4 in text recognition and map captioning, it still has a limited understanding of maps, as its performance wanes when texts (e.g., titles and legends) in maps are missing or inaccurate. Besides, it is inefficient or even impractical to fine-tune the model with users' own datasets. To address these problems, we propose a novel and lightweight map-captioning counterpart. Specifically, we fine-tune the state-of-the-art vision-language model CLIP to generate captions relevant to historical maps and enrich the captions with GPT-3.5 to tell a brief story regarding where, what, when and why of a given map. We propose a novel decision tree architecture to only generate captions relevant to the specified map type. Our system shows invariance to text alterations in maps. The system can be easily adapted and extended to other map types and scaled to a larger map captioning system. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/claudaff/automatic-map-storytelling.</p></details> |  |

Unlike in large language models (LLMs), hallucination in LVLMs often arises from misalignments between visual inputs and textual outputs. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of hallucination, focusing on the unique structure of LVLMs that distinguishes them from large language models (LLMs). We identify that hallucinations often arise from the sensitivity of text decoders to vision inputs, a natural phenomenon when image encoders and text decoders are pre-trained separately. Inspired by this, we introduce Visual and Textual Intervention (VTI), a novel technique designed to reduce hallucinations by steering latent space representations during inference to enhance the stability of vision features. As a task-agnostic test-time intervention, VTI can be easily applied to any problem without additional cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can effectively reduce hallucinations and outperform baseline methods across multiple metrics, highlighting the critical role of vision feature stability in LVLMs.</p></details> | 21 pages |

However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HiRT, a Hierarchical Robot Transformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, in static tasks, we double the control frequency and achieve comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel real-world dynamic ma nipulation tasks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48% to 75%.</p></details> |  |

However, MLLMs face significant security challenges, such as jailbreak attacks, where attackers attempt to bypass the model's safety alignment to elicit harmful responses. The threat of jailbreak attacks on MLLMs arises from both the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs and the multiple information channels that MLLMs process. While various attacks and defenses have been proposed, there is a notable gap in unified and comprehensive evaluations, as each method is evaluated on different dataset and metrics, making it impossible to compare the effectiveness of each method. To address this gap, we introduce \textit{MMJ-Bench}, a unified pipeline for evaluating jailbreak attacks and defense techniques for MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, we assess the effectiveness of various attack methods against SoTA MLLMs and evaluate the impact of defense mechanisms on both defense effectiveness and model utility for normal tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation contribute to the field by offering a unified and systematic evaluation framework and the first public-available benchmark for MLLM jailbreak research. We also demonstrate several insightful findings that highlights directions for future studies.</p></details> |  |

Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) can inherently recognize and reason about interactions at the image level but are computationally heavy and not designed for instance-level HOI detection. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Cross-Level HOI distillation (CL-HOI) framework, which distills instance-level HOIs from VLLMs image-level understanding without the need for manual annotations. Our approach involves two stages: context distillation, where a Visual Linguistic Translator (VLT) converts visual information into linguistic form, and interaction distillation, where an Interaction Cognition Network (ICN) reasons about spatial, visual, and context relations. We design contrastive distillation losses to transfer image-level context and interaction knowledge from the teacher to the student model, enabling instance-level HOI detection. Evaluations on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate that our CL-HOI surpasses existing weakly supervised methods and VLLM supervised methods, showing its efficacy in detecting HOIs without manual labels.</p></details> |  |

In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs' effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date. It is constructed from 284 datasets across 38 medical image modalities, 18 clinical-related tasks, 18 departments, and 4 perceptual granularities in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. Additionally, we implemented a lexical tree structure that allows users to customize evaluation tasks, accommodating various assessment needs and substantially supporting medical AI research and applications. We evaluated 50 LVLMs, and the results show that even the advanced GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of 53.96%, indicating significant room for improvement. Moreover, we identified five key insufficiencies in current cutting-edge LVLMs that need to be addressed to advance the development of better medical applications. We believe that GMAI-MMBench will stimulate the community to build the next generation of LVLMs toward GMAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub: https://github.com/uni-medical/GMAI-MMBench Hugging face: https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenGVLab/GMAI-MMBench</p></details> |

However, achieving efficient real-time performance remains challenging due to the high computational demands of existing models. To overcome this, we propose Dual Process VLA (DP-VLA), a hierarchical framework inspired by dual-process theory. DP-VLA utilizes a Large System 2 Model (L-Sys2) for complex reasoning and decision-making, while a Small System 1 Model (S-Sys1) handles real-time motor control and sensory processing. By leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the L-Sys2 operates at low frequencies, reducing computational overhead, while the S-Sys1 ensures fast and accurate task execution. Experimental results on the RoboCasa dataset demonstrate that DP-VLA achieves faster inference and higher task success rates, providing a scalable solution for advanced robotic applications.</p></details> | 10 page |

GRS enables the creation of digital twin simulations from single real-world RGB-D observations, complete with diverse, solvable tasks for virtual agent training. We use state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to achieve a comprehensive real-to-sim pipeline. GRS operates in three stages: 1) scene comprehension using SAM2 for object segmentation and VLMs for object description, 2) matching identified objects with simulation-ready assets, and 3) generating contextually appropriate robotic tasks. Our approach ensures simulations align with task specifications by generating test suites designed to verify adherence to the task specification. We introduce a router that iteratively refines the simulation and test code to ensure the simulation is solvable by a robot policy while remaining aligned to the task specification. Our experiments demonstrate the system's efficacy in accurately identifying object correspondence, which allows us to generate task environments that closely match input environments, and enhance automated simulation task generation through our novel router mechanism.</p></details> |  |

When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, showing that the proposed RLEF refines the agent's decision-making.

Previous works have proposed a variety of test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to achieve strong generalization without any knowledge of the target domain. However, existing training-required TTA approaches like TPT necessitate entropy minimization that involves large computational overhead, while training-free methods like TDA overlook the potential for information mining from the test samples themselves. In this paper, we break down the design of existing popular training-required and training-free TTA methods and bridge the gap between them within our framework. Specifically, we maintain a light-weight key-value memory for feature retrieval from instance-agnostic historical samples and instance-aware boosting samples. The historical samples are filtered from the testing data stream and serve to extract useful information from the target distribution, while the boosting samples are drawn from regional bootstrapping and capture the knowledge of the test sample itself. We theoretically justify the rationality behind our method and empirically verify its effectiveness on both the out-of-distribution and the cross-domain datasets, showcasing its applicability in real-world situations.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[IPO: Interpretable Prompt Optimization for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15397v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have remarkably adapted to various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for thae creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Scene Graph Generation with Role-Playing Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15364v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current approaches for open-vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) use vision-language models such as CLIP and follow a standard zero-shot pipeline -- computing similarity between the query image and the text embeddings for each category (i.e., text classifiers). In this work, we argue that the text classifiers adopted by existing OVSGG methods, i.e., category-/part-level prompts, are scene-agnostic as they remain unchanged across contexts. Using such fixed text classifiers not only struggles to model visual relations with high variance, but also falls short in adapting to distinct contexts. To plug these intrinsic shortcomings, we devise SDSGG, a scene-specific description based OVSGG framework where the weights of text classifiers are adaptively adjusted according to the visual content. In particular, to generate comprehensive and diverse descriptions oriented to the scene, an LLM is asked to play different roles (e.g., biologist and engineer) to analyze and discuss the descriptive features of a given scene from different views. Unlike previous efforts simply treating the generated descriptions as mutually equivalent text classifiers, SDSGG is equipped with an advanced renormalization mechanism to adjust the influence of each text classifier based on its relevance to the presented scene (this is what the term "specific" means). Furthermore, to capture the complicated interplay between subjects and objects, we propose a new lightweight module called mutual visual adapter. It refines CLIP's ability to recognize relations by learning an interaction-aware semantic space. Extensive experiments on prevalent benchmarks show that SDSGG outperforms top-leading methods by a clear margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Can LVLMs Describe Videos like Humans? A Five-in-One Video Annotations Benchmark for Better Human-Machine Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15270v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in addressing complex video tasks, sparking researchers' interest in their human-like multimodal understanding capabilities. Video description serves as a fundamental task for evaluating video comprehension, necessitating a deep understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics, which presents challenges for both humans and machines. Thus, investigating whether LVLMs can describe videos as comprehensively as humans (through reasonable human-machine comparisons using video captioning as a proxy task) will enhance our understanding and application of these models. However, current benchmarks for video comprehension have notable limitations, including short video durations, brief annotations, and reliance on a single annotator's perspective. These factors hinder a comprehensive assessment of LVLMs' ability to understand complex, lengthy videos and prevent the establishment of a robust human baseline that accurately reflects human video comprehension capabilities. To address these issues, we propose a novel benchmark, FIOVA (Five In One Video Annotations), designed to evaluate the differences between LVLMs and human understanding more comprehensively. FIOVA includes 3,002 long video sequences (averaging 33.6 seconds) that cover diverse scenarios with complex spatiotemporal relationships. Each video is annotated by five distinct annotators, capturing a wide range of perspectives and resulting in captions that are 4-15 times longer than existing benchmarks, thereby establishing a robust baseline that represents human understanding comprehensively for the first time in video description tasks. Using the FIOVA benchmark, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of six state-of-the-art LVLMs, comparing their performance with humans.

To do this, our system optimizes the parameters of a deformation model to maximize an objective function based on the widely used pre-trained vision language model CLIP. We find that CLIP-based objective functions exhibit many spurious local optima; to circumvent them, we parameterize deformations using a novel deformation model called BoxDefGraph which our system automatically computes from an input mesh, the BoxDefGraph is designed to capture the object aligned rectangular/circular geometry features of most manufactured objects. We then use the CMA-ES global optimization algorithm to maximize our objective, which we find to work better than popular gradient-based optimizers. We demonstrate that our approach produces appealing results and outperforms several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Despite this rapid proliferation, the trustworthiness of foundation models remains underexplored. Specifically, the out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, which are trained on massive multi-modal data, have not been sufficiently addressed. The disparity between their demonstrated potential and practical reliability raises concerns regarding the safe and trustworthy deployment of foundation models. To address this gap, we evaluate and analyze the OoDD capabilities of various proprietary and open-source LVLMs. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of how these foundation models represent confidence scores through their generated natural language responses. Based on our observations, we propose a self-guided prompting approach, termed \emph{Reflexive Guidance (ReGuide)}, aimed at enhancing the OoDD capability of LVLMs by leveraging self-generated image-adaptive concept suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that our ReGuide enhances the performance of current LVLMs in both image classification and OoDD tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have the potential to assist in understanding anatomical information, diagnosing eye diseases, and drafting interpretations and follow-up plans, thereby reducing the burden on clinicians and improving access to eye care. However, limited benchmarks are available to assess LVLMs' performance in ophthalmology-specific applications. In this study, we introduce LMOD, a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark consisting of 21,993 instances across (1) five ophthalmic imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography, color fundus photographs, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, lens photographs, and surgical scenes; (2) free-text, demographic, and disease biomarker information; and (3) primary ophthalmology-specific applications such as anatomical information understanding, disease diagnosis, and subgroup analysis. In addition, we benchmarked 13 state-of-the-art LVLM representatives from closed-source, open-source, and medical domains. The results demonstrate a significant performance drop for LVLMs in ophthalmology compared to other domains. Systematic error analysis further identified six major failure modes: misclassification, failure to abstain, inconsistent reasoning, hallucination, assertions without justification, and lack of domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, supervised neural networks specifically trained on these tasks as baselines demonstrated high accuracy. These findings underscore the pressing need for benchmarks in the development and validation of ophthalmology-specific LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://kfzyqin.github.io/lmod/</p></details> |
| **[A Hybrid Defense Strategy for Boosting Adversarial Robustness in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14911v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP is critical for their deployment in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, healthcare diagnostics, and security systems, where accurate interpretation of visual and textual data is essential. However, these models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can severely compromise their performance and reliability in real-world scenarios. Previous methods have primarily focused on improving robustness through adversarial training and generating adversarial examples using models like FGSM, AutoAttack, and DeepFool. However, these approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as fixed perturbation norms or predefined attack patterns, and involve high computational complexity, making them challenging to implement in practical settings. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training framework that integrates multiple attack strategies and advanced machine learning techniques to significantly enhance the robustness of VLMs against a broad range of adversarial attacks. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances model robustness. The fine-tuned CLIP model achieved an accuracy of 43.5% on adversarially perturbed images, compared to only 4% for the baseline model. The neural network model achieved a high accuracy of 98% in these challenging classification tasks, while the XGBoost model reached a success rate of 85.26% in prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

A Mechanistic Interpretability Pipeline for Gaussian-Noise-free Text-Image Corruption and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16320v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained community-spanning prominence due to their ability to integrate visual and textual inputs to perform complex tasks. Despite their success, the internal decision-making processes of these models remain opaque, posing challenges in high-stakes applications. To address this, we introduce NOTICE, the first Noise-free Text-Image Corruption and Evaluation pipeline for mechanistic interpretability in VLMs. NOTICE incorporates a Semantic Minimal Pairs (SMP) framework for image corruption and Symmetric Token Replacement (STR) for text. This approach enables semantically meaningful causal mediation analysis for both modalities, providing a robust method for analyzing multimodal integration within models like BLIP. Our experiments on the SVO-Probes, MIT-States, and Facial Expression Recognition datasets reveal crucial insights into VLM decision-making, identifying the significant role of middle-layer cross-attention heads. Further, we uncover a set of ``universal cross-attention heads'' that consistently contribute across tasks and modalities, each performing distinct functions such as implicit image segmentation, object inhibition, and outlier inhibition. This work paves the way for more transparent and interpretable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[NaturalBench: Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Natural Adversarial Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14669v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks that evaluate complex visio-linguistic reasoning. However, are these models truly effective? In this work, we show that VLMs still struggle with natural images and questions that humans can easily answer, which we term natural adversarial samples. We also find it surprisingly easy to generate these VQA samples from natural image-text corpora using off-the-shelf models like CLIP and ChatGPT. We propose a semi-automated approach to collect a new benchmark, NaturalBench, for reliably evaluating VLMs with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples. Crucially, we adopt a $\textbf{vision-centric}$ design by pairing each question with two images that yield different answers, preventing blind solutions from answering without using the images. This makes NaturalBench more challenging than previous benchmarks that can be solved with commonsense priors. We evaluate 53 state-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench, showing that models like LLaVA-OneVision, Cambrian-1, Llama3.2-Vision, Molmo, Qwen2-VL, and even GPT-4o lag 50%-70% behind human performance (over 90%). We analyze why NaturalBench is hard from two angles: (1) Compositionality: Solving NaturalBench requires diverse visio-linguistic skills, including understanding attribute bindings, object relationships, and advanced reasoning like logic and counting. To this end, unlike prior work that uses a single tag per sample, we tag each NaturalBench sample with 1 to 8 skill tags for fine-grained evaluation. (2) Biases: NaturalBench exposes severe biases in VLMs, as models often choose the same answer regardless of the image. Lastly, we apply our benchmark curation method to diverse data sources, including long captions (over 100 words) and non-English languages like Chinese and Hindi, highlighting its potential for dynamic evaluations of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 24; We open-source our dataset at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/BaiqiL/NaturalBench; Project page at: https://linzhiqiu.github.io/papers/naturalbench/</p></details> |

To advance this field, we introduce Movie101v2, a large-scale, bilingual dataset with enhanced data quality specifically designed for movie narration. Revisiting the task, we propose breaking down the ultimate goal of automatic movie narration into three progressive stages, offering a clear roadmap with corresponding evaluation metrics. Based on our new benchmark, we baseline a range of large vision-language models, including GPT-4V, and conduct an in-depth analysis of the challenges in narration generation. Our findings highlight that achieving applicable movie narration generation is a fascinating goal that requires significant research.</p></details> |  |

However, it is unclear how these models will influence financial markets, especially when they infer financial value in a semi-autonomous way. In this work, we explore the interplay between deep generative models and market dynamics. We develop a form of virtual traders that use deep generative models to make buy/sell decisions, which we term neuro-symbolic traders, and expose them to a virtual market. Under our framework, neuro-symbolic traders are agents that use vision-language models to discover a model of the fundamental value of an asset. Agents develop this model as a stochastic differential equation, calibrated to market data using gradient descent. We test our neuro-symbolic traders on both synthetic data and real financial time series, including an equity stock, commodity, and a foreign exchange pair. We then expose several groups of neuro-symbolic traders to a virtual market environment. This market environment allows for feedback between the traders belief of the underlying value to the observed price dynamics. We find that this leads to price suppression compared to the historical data, highlighting a future risk to market stability. Our work is a first step towards quantifying the effect of deep generative agents on markets dynamics and sets out some of the potential risks and benefits of this approach in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, ACM format</p></details> |

However, an understudied question is to what extent models that only have access to vision and text modalities are able to implicitly understand sound-based phenomena via abstract reasoning from orthography and imagery alone. To investigate this, we analyse the ability of VLMs and LLMs to demonstrate sound symbolism (i.e., to recognise a non-arbitrary link between sounds and concepts) as well as their ability to "hear" via the interplay of the language and vision modules of open and closed-source multimodal models. We perform multiple experiments, including replicating the classic Kiki-Bouba and Mil-Mal shape and magnitude symbolism tasks, and comparing human judgements of linguistic iconicity with that of LLMs. Our results show that VLMs demonstrate varying levels of agreement with human labels, and more task information may be required for VLMs versus their human counterparts for in silico experimentation. We additionally see through higher maximum agreement levels that Magnitude Symbolism is an easier pattern for VLMs to identify than Shape Symbolism, and that an understanding of linguistic iconicity is highly dependent on model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 (Camera Ready)</p></details> |

Typically, MLLMs struggle with handling thousands of visual tokens that exceed the maximum context length, and they suffer from the information decay due to token aggregation. Another challenge is the high computational cost stemming from the large number of video tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose Video-XL, an extra-long vision language model designed for efficient hour-scale video understanding. Specifically, we argue that LLMs can be adapted as effective visual condensers and propose Visual Context Latent Summarization which condenses visual contexts into highly compact forms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves promising results on popular long video understanding benchmarks. For example, Video-XL outperforms the current state-of-the-art method on VNBench by nearly 10\% in accuracy. Moreover, Video-XL presents an impressive balance between efficiency and effectiveness, processing 2048 frames on a single 80GB GPU while achieving nearly 95% accuracy in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, this task has been tackled by processing either audio signals or visual data, or by combining both modalities through fusion or joint learning. In our study, drawing inspiration from recent advancements in visual-language models, we introduce a novel approach leveraging Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models. The CLIP visual encoder analyzes video segments composed of the upper body of an individual, while the text encoder handles textual descriptions automatically generated through prompt engineering. Subsequently, embeddings from these encoders are fused through a deep neural network to perform VAD. Our experimental analysis across three VAD benchmarks showcases the superior performance of our method compared to existing visual VAD approaches. Notably, our approach outperforms several audio-visual methods despite its simplicity, and without requiring pre-training on extensive audio-visual datasets.</p></details> |  |

But in many cases, large scale datasets with video-label pairs for localization are unavailable, limiting the opportunity to fine-tune video-understanding models. Recent developments in large vision-language models (LVLM) address this need with impressive zero-shot capabilities in a variety of video understanding tasks. However, the adaptation of image-based LVLMs, with their powerful visual question answering capabilities, to action localization in long-form video is still relatively unexplored. To this end, we introduce a true ZEro-shot Action Localization method (ZEAL). Specifically, we leverage the built-in action knowledge of a large language model (LLM) to inflate actions into highly-detailed descriptions of the archetypal start and end of the action. These descriptions serve as queries to LVLM for generating frame-level confidence scores which can be aggregated to produce localization outputs. The simplicity and flexibility of our method lends it amenable to more capable LVLMs as they are developed, and we demonstrate remarkable results in zero-shot action localization on a challenging benchmark, without any training.</p></details> |  |

However, memory lapses can occur. One promising avenue for achieving memory augmentation is through the use of augmented reality head-mounted displays to capture and preserve egocentric videos, a practice commonly referred to as lifelogging. However, a significant challenge arises from the sheer volume of video data generated through lifelogging, as the current technology lacks the capability to encode and store such large amounts of data efficiently. Further, retrieving specific information from extensive video archives requires substantial computational power, further complicating the task of quickly accessing desired content. To address these challenges, we propose a memory augmentation agent that involves leveraging natural language encoding for video data and storing them in a vector database. This approach harnesses the power of large vision language models to perform the language encoding process. Additionally, we propose using large language models to facilitate natural language querying. Our agent underwent extensive evaluation using the QA-Ego4D dataset and achieved state-of-the-art results with a BLEU score of 8.3, outperforming conventional machine learning models that scored between 3.4 and 5.8. Additionally, we conducted a user study in which participants interacted with the human memory augmentation agent through episodic memory and open-ended questions. The results of this study show that the agent results in significantly better recall performance on episodic memory tasks compared to human participants. The results also highlight the agent's practical applicability and user acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, compared to 2D medical images, 3D medical images, such as CT scans, face challenges related to limited training data and high dimension, which severely restrict the progress of 3D medical vision-language models. To address these issues, we collect a large amount of unlabeled 3D CT data and utilize self-supervised learning to construct a 3D visual foundation model for extracting 3D visual features. Then, we apply 3D spatial convolutions to aggregate and project high-level image features, reducing computational complexity while preserving spatial information. We also construct two instruction-tuning datasets based on BIMCV-R and CT-RATE to fine-tune the 3D vision-language model. Our model demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in report generation, visual question answering, and disease diagnosis.

Despite advancements in safety training, laboratory personnel may still unknowingly engage in unsafe practices. With the increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) for guidance in various fields, including laboratory settings, there is a growing concern about their reliability in critical safety-related decision-making. Unlike trained human researchers, LLMs lack formal lab safety education, raising questions about their ability to provide safe and accurate guidance. Existing research on LLM trustworthiness primarily focuses on issues such as ethical compliance, truthfulness, and fairness but fails to fully cover safety-critical real-world applications, like lab safety. To address this gap, we propose the Laboratory Safety Benchmark (LabSafety Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework based on a new taxonomy aligned with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) protocols. This benchmark includes 765 multiple-choice questions verified by human experts, assessing LLMs and vision language models (VLMs) performance in lab safety contexts. Our evaluations demonstrate that while GPT-4o outperforms human participants, it is still prone to critical errors, highlighting the risks of relying on LLMs in safety-critical environments. Our findings emphasize the need for specialized benchmarks to accurately assess the trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world safety applications.</p></details> | 50 pages, 19 figures |

However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we present ExACT, an approach to combine test-time search and self-learning to build o1-like models for agentic applications. We first introduce Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a novel test time algorithm designed to enhance AI agents' ability to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate for reliable state evaluation. Next, we introduce Exploratory Learning, a novel learning strategy to teach agents to search at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, our GPT-4o based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that the knowledge and experience gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. After Exploratory Learning, GPT-4o 1) demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success, and 2) matches 87% of R-MCTS's performance while using significantly less compute. Notably, our work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time.

However, they often prioritize language knowledge over image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing solutions (i.e., insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions, and limited multi-modal capacities). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two stages: visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e., wisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This framework features multi-run proactive perception and decoupled vision-reasoning capabilities. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason iterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be concluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the disassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms both existing multi-step reasoning frameworks and passive peer methods on a wide range of benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models. In addition, with the assistance of LLMs, ProReason achieves a performance improvement of up to 15% on MMMU benchmark. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled perspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on visual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Vision-Language Models by Summarizing Visual Tokens into Compact Registers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14072v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded their potential for real-world applications, enabling these models to perform complex reasoning on images. In the widely used fully autoregressive transformer-based models like LLaVA, projected visual tokens are prepended to textual tokens. Oftentimes, visual tokens are significantly more than prompt tokens, resulting in increased computational overhead during both training and inference. In this paper, we propose Visual Compact Token Registers (Victor), a method that reduces the number of visual tokens by summarizing them into a smaller set of register tokens. Victor adds a few learnable register tokens after the visual tokens and summarizes the visual information into these registers using the first few layers in the language tower of VLMs. After these few layers, all visual tokens are discarded, significantly improving computational efficiency for both training and inference. Notably, our method is easy to implement and requires a small number of new trainable parameters with minimal impact on model performance. In our experiment, with merely 8 visual registers--about 1% of the original tokens--Victor shows less than a 4% accuracy drop while reducing the total training time by 43% and boosting the inference throughput by 3.3X.</p></details> |  |

Thus, it is essential for LVLMs to proactively engage with humans to ask for clarifications or additional information for better responses. In this study, we aim to shift LVLMs from passive answer providers to proactive engaged partners. We begin by establishing a three-tiered hierarchy for questions of invalid, ambiguous, and personalizable nature to measure the proactive engagement capabilities of LVLMs. Utilizing this hierarchy, we create PIE, (ProactIve Engagement Evaluation) through GPT-4o and human annotators, consisting of 853 questions across six distinct, fine-grained question types that are verified by human annotators and accompanied with well-defined metrics. Our evaluations on \benchmark indicate poor performance of existing LVLMs, with the best-performing open-weights model only achieving an Aggregate Align Rate (AAR) of 0.28. In response, we introduce MACAROON, self-iMaginAtion for ContrAstive pReference OptimizatiON, which instructs LVLMs to autonomously generate contrastive response pairs for unlabeled questions given the task description and human-crafted criteria. Then, the self-imagined data is formatted for conditional reinforcement learning. Experimental results show MACAROON effectively improves LVLMs' capabilities to be proactively engaged (0.84 AAR) while maintaining comparable performance on general tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code will be made public at https://github.com/ShujinWu-0814/MACAROON</p></details> |

This paper investigates the claims made by Lei et al. (2023) regarding their proposed method, LICO, for enhancing post-hoc interpretability techniques and improving image classification performance. LICO leverages natural language supervision from a vision-language model to enrich feature representations and guide the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study, employing (Wide) ResNets and established interpretability methods like Grad-CAM and RISE. We were mostly unable to reproduce the authors' results. In particular, we did not find that LICO consistently led to improved classification performance or improvements in quantitative and qualitative measures of interpretability.

However, their responses are influenced by societal biases present in their training datasets, leading to undesirable differences in how the model responds when presented with images depicting people of different demographics. In this work, we propose a novel debiasing framework for LVLMs by directly ablating biased attributes during text generation to avoid generating text related to protected attributes, or even representing them internally. Our method requires no training and a relatively small amount of representative biased outputs (~1000 samples). Our experiments show that not only can we can minimize the propensity of LVLMs to generate text related to protected attributes, but we can even use synthetic data to inform the ablation while retaining captioning performance on real data such as COCO. Furthermore, we find the resulting generations from a debiased LVLM exhibit similar accuracy as a baseline biased model, showing that debiasing effects can be achieved without sacrificing model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS workshop on SafeGenAI, 10 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

Traditional methods depending on supervised learning with 3D point clouds are limited by scarce datasets. Recently zero-shot methods leveraging LLMs have been proposed to address the data issue. While effective, these methods only use object-centric information, limiting their ability to handle complex queries. In this work, we present VLM-Grounder, a novel framework using vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot 3D visual grounding based solely on 2D images. VLM-Grounder dynamically stitches image sequences, employs a grounding and feedback scheme to find the target object, and uses a multi-view ensemble projection to accurately estimate 3D bounding boxes. Experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets show VLM-Grounder outperforms previous zero-shot methods, achieving 51.6% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer and 48.0% Acc on Nr3D, without relying on 3D geometry or object priors.

Our model integrates a kinematics-aware deformable model and Gaussians Splatting and is compatible with any robot form factors and degrees of freedom. We demonstrate its capability and usage in applications including reconstruction of robot poses from images and controlling robots through vision language models. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our differentiable rendering model provides effective gradients for robotic control directly from pixels, setting the foundation for the future applications of vision foundation models in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://drrobot.cs.columbia.edu/</p></details> |

Beyond mere data augmentation, our research in this paper highlights an additional, significant capacity of deep generative models: their ability to reveal and demonstrate patterns in medical images. We employ a generative structure with hybrid conditions, combining clinical data and segmentation masks to guide the image synthesis process. Furthermore, we innovatively transformed the tabular clinical data into textual descriptions. This approach simplifies the handling of missing values and also enables us to leverage large pre-trained vision-language models that investigate the relations between independent clinical entries and comprehend general terms, such as gender and smoking status. Our approach differs from and presents a more challenging task than traditional medical report-guided synthesis due to the less visual correlation of our clinical information with the images. To overcome this, we introduce a text-visual embedding mechanism that strengthens the conditions, ensuring the network effectively utilizes the provided information. Our pipeline is generalizable to both GAN-based and diffusion models. Experiments on chest CT, particularly focusing on the smoking status, demonstrated a consistent intensity shift in the lungs which is in agreement with clinical observations, indicating the effectiveness of our method in capturing and visualizing the impact of specific attributes on medical image patterns.

However, there has been no investigation into whether contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can harness these sub-character features in Chinese through prompting. In this study, we establish a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' and VLMs' understanding of visual elements in Chinese characters, including radicals, composition structures, strokes, and stroke counts. Our results reveal that models surprisingly exhibit some, but still limited, knowledge of the visual information, regardless of whether images of characters are provided. To incite models' ability to use radicals, we further experiment with incorporating radicals into the prompts for Chinese language processing (CLP) tasks. We observe consistent improvement in Part-Of-Speech tagging when providing additional information about radicals, suggesting the potential to enhance CLP by integrating sub-character information.</p></details> |  |

We propose \textbf{Arcana}, a multiModal language model, which introduces two crucial techniques. First, we present Multimodal LoRA (MM-LoRA), a module designed to enhance the decoder. Unlike traditional language-driven decoders, MM-LoRA consists of two parallel LoRAs -- one for vision and one for language -- each with its own parameters. This disentangled parameters design allows for more specialized learning in each modality and better integration of multimodal information. Second, we introduce the Query Ladder adapter (QLadder) to improve the visual encoder. QLadder employs a learnable ``\textit{ladder}'' structure to deeply aggregates the intermediate representations from the frozen pretrained visual encoder (e.g., CLIP image encoder). This enables the model to learn new and informative visual features, as well as remaining the powerful capabilities of the pretrained visual encoder. These techniques collectively enhance Arcana's visual perception power, enabling it to leverage improved visual information for more accurate and contextually relevant outputs across various multimodal scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our Arcana. The code and re-annotated data are available at \url{https://arcana-project-page.github.io}.</p></details> |  |

A similar ability is desirable for the development of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. While state-of-the-art models are rapidly closing the gap with human-level performance on diverse computer vision and NLP tasks separately, they struggle to solve tasks that require joint reasoning over visual and textual modalities. Inspired by GLUE (Wang et. al., 2018)- a multitask benchmark for natural language understanding, we propose VL-GLUE in this paper. VL-GLUE consists of over 100k samples spanned across seven different tasks, which at their core require visuo-linguistic reasoning. Moreover, our benchmark comprises of diverse image types (from synthetically rendered figures, and day-to-day scenes to charts and complex diagrams) and includes a broad variety of domain-specific text (from cooking, politics, and sports to high-school curricula), demonstrating the need for multi-modal understanding in the real-world. We show that this benchmark is quite challenging for existing large-scale vision-language models and encourage development of systems that possess robust visuo-linguistic reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

As these models are widely deployed in consumer applications, they could lead to new privacy risks due to emergent abilities to identify people in photos, geolocate images, etc. As we demonstrate, somewhat surprisingly, current open-source and proprietary VLMs are very capable image geolocators, making widespread geolocation with VLMs an immediate privacy risk, rather than merely a theoretical future concern. As a first step to address this challenge, we develop a new benchmark, GPTGeoChat, to test the ability of VLMs to moderate geolocation dialogues with users. We collect a set of 1,000 image geolocation conversations between in-house annotators and GPT-4v, which are annotated with the granularity of location information revealed at each turn. Using this new dataset, we evaluate the ability of various VLMs to moderate GPT-4v geolocation conversations by determining when too much location information has been revealed. We find that custom fine-tuned models perform on par with prompted API-based models when identifying leaked location information at the country or city level; however, fine-tuning on supervised data appears to be needed to accurately moderate finer granularities, such as the name of a restaurant or building.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

These models require strong language understanding and visual capabilities to enhance human-machine interaction. To address this need, we present H2OVL-Mississippi, a pair of small VLMs trained on 37 million image-text pairs using 240 hours of compute on 8 x H100 GPUs. H2OVL-Mississippi-0.8B is a tiny model with 0.8 billion parameters that specializes in text recognition, achieving state of the art performance on the Text Recognition portion of OCRBench and surpassing much larger models in this area. Additionally, we are releasing H2OVL-Mississippi-2B, a 2 billion parameter model for general use cases, exhibiting highly competitive metrics across various academic benchmarks. Both models build upon our prior work with H2O-Danube language models, extending their capabilities into the visual domain.

Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in various multimodal tasks. Yet, they still struggle with geometry problems and are significantly limited by their inability to perform mathematical operations not seen during pre-training, such as calculating the cosine of an arbitrary angle, and by difficulties in correctly applying relevant geometry formulas. To overcome these challenges, we present GeoCoder, which leverages modular code-finetuning to generate and execute code using a predefined geometry function library. By executing the code, we achieve accurate and deterministic calculations, contrasting the stochastic nature of autoregressive token prediction, while the function library minimizes errors in formula usage. We also propose a multimodal retrieval-augmented variant of GeoCoder, named RAG-GeoCoder, which incorporates a non-parametric memory module for retrieving functions from the geometry library, thereby reducing reliance on parametric memory. Our modular code-finetuning approach enhances the geometric reasoning capabilities of VLMs, yielding an average improvement of over 16% across various question complexities on the GeomVerse dataset compared to other finetuning methods.</p></details> |  |

While existing defenses excel in unimodal contexts, they currently fall short in safeguarding VLMs against adversarial threats. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel, yet elegantly simple approach for detecting adversarial samples in VLMs. Our method leverages Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate images based on captions produced by target VLMs. Subsequently, we calculate the similarities of the embeddings of both input and generated images in the feature space to identify adversarial samples. Empirical evaluations conducted on different datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming baseline methods adapted from image classification domains. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to classification tasks, showcasing its adaptability and model-agnostic nature. Theoretical analyses and empirical findings also show the resilience of our approach against adaptive attacks, positioning it as an excellent defense mechanism for real-world deployment against adversarial threats.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks. We validated our system in real-world environments with varying degrees of manual modifications, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance in long-term tasks.

However, they are prone to generate hallucinations due to an over-reliance on language priors. To address this issue, we investigate the language priors in LVLMs and make two key observations: (1) Even when predicting the tokens associated with image-related part-of-speech (POS), models increasingly rely on linguistic priors as the token sequences grow, thereby amplifying hallucinations. (2) Methods that directly calibrate LVLM's output distribution to mitigate language priors can lead to a degradation in text quality or even exacerbate hallucinations. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method, Summary-Guided Decoding (SGD). This method naturally encourages the model to focus more on image information by reducing the text context through summaries, while controlling only the image-related POS tokens to maintain text quality. Through experiments, we demonstrate that SGD achieves state-of-the-art performance on object hallucination benchmarks. Furthermore, in terms of the trade-off between precision and recall, SGD achieves Pareto optimality among the existing methods. Lastly, we observe that although existing methods struggle to balance the reduction of object hallucinations with maintaining text quality, SGD demonstrates robustness in handling this challenge.</p></details> |  |

| **[OpenDAS: Open-Vocabulary Domain Adaptation for Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20141v3)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced segmentation techniques by shifting from the traditional segmentation of a closed-set of predefined object classes to open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS), allowing users to segment novel classes and concepts unseen during training of the segmentation model. However, this flexibility comes with a trade-off: fully-supervised closed-set methods still outperform OVS methods on base classes, that is on classes on which they have been explicitly trained. This is due to the lack of pixel-aligned training masks for VLMs (which are trained on image-caption pairs), and the absence of domain-specific knowledge, such as autonomous driving. Therefore, we propose the task of open-vocabulary domain adaptation to infuse domain-specific knowledge into VLMs while preserving their open-vocabulary nature. By doing so, we achieve improved performance in base and novel classes. Existing VLM adaptation methods improve performance on base (training) queries, but fail to fully preserve the open-set capabilities of VLMs on novel queries. To address this shortcoming, we combine parameter-efficient prompt tuning with a triplet-loss-based training strategy that uses auxiliary negative queries. Notably, our approach is the only parameter-efficient method that consistently surpasses the original VLM on novel classes. Our adapted VLMs can seamlessly be integrated into existing OVS pipelines, e.g., improving OVSeg by +6.0% mIoU on ADE20K for open-vocabulary 2D segmentation, and OpenMask3D by +4.1% AP on ScanNet++ Offices for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without other changes.</p></details> |  |

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities.

A primary challenge here is the scarcity of data for training the LVLM - existing street-view datasets often contain numerous low-quality images lacking visual clues, and lack any reasoning inference. To address the data-quality issue, we devise a CLIP-based network to quantify the degree of street-view images being locatable, leading to the creation of a new dataset comprising highly locatable street views. To enhance reasoning inference, we integrate external knowledge obtained from real geo-localization games, tapping into valuable human inference capabilities. The data are utilized to train GeoReasoner, which undergoes fine-tuning through dedicated reasoning and location-tuning stages. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate that GeoReasoner outperforms counterpart LVLMs by more than 25% at country-level and 38% at city-level geo-localization tasks, and surpasses StreetCLIP performance while requiring fewer training resources.

However, current Med-LVLMs frequently encounter factual issues, often generating responses that do not align with established medical facts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which utilizes external knowledge, can improve the factual accuracy of these models but introduces two major challenges. First, limited retrieved contexts might not cover all necessary information, while excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant and inaccurate references, interfering with the model's generation. Second, in cases where the model originally responds correctly, applying RAG can lead to an over-reliance on retrieved contexts, resulting in incorrect answers. To address these issues, we propose RULE, which consists of two components. First, we introduce a provably effective strategy for controlling factuality risk through the calibrated selection of the number of retrieved contexts. Second, based on samples where over-reliance on retrieved contexts led to errors, we curate a preference dataset to fine-tune the model, balancing its dependence on inherent knowledge and retrieved contexts for generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RULE on medical VQA and report generation tasks across three datasets, achieving an average improvement of 47.4% in factual accuracy. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/RULE.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 main |

However, reliably quantifying the effect of such hallucinations in free-form responses to open-ended queries is challenging as it requires visually verifying each claim within the response. We propose Programmatic VLM Evaluation (PROVE), a new benchmarking paradigm for evaluating VLM responses to open-ended queries. To construct PROVE, we provide a large language model (LLM) with a high-fidelity scene-graph representation constructed from a hyper-detailed image caption, and prompt it to generate diverse question-answer (QA) pairs, as well as programs that can be executed over the scene graph object to verify each QA pair. We thus construct a benchmark of 10.5k challenging but visually grounded QA pairs. Next, to evaluate free-form model responses to queries in PROVE, we propose a programmatic evaluation strategy that measures both the helpfulness and truthfulness of a response within a unified scene graph-based framework. We benchmark the helpfulness-truthfulness trade-offs of a range of VLMs on PROVE, finding that very few are in-fact able to achieve a good balance between the two.

| **[From Redundancy to Relevance: Information Flow in LVLMs Across Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06579v3)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) achieve great performance on visual-language reasoning tasks, however, the black-box nature of LVLMs hinders in-depth research on the reasoning mechanism. As all images need to be converted into image tokens to fit the input format of large language models (LLMs) along with natural language prompts, sequential visual representation is essential to the performance of LVLMs, and the information flow analysis approach can be an effective tool for determining interactions between these representations. In this paper, we propose integrating attention analysis with LLaVA-CAM, concretely, attention scores highlight relevant regions during forward propagation, while LLaVA-CAM captures gradient changes through backward propagation, revealing key image features. By exploring the information flow from the perspective of visual representation contribution, we observe that it tends to converge in shallow layers but diversify in deeper layers. To validate our analysis, we conduct comprehensive experiments with truncation strategies across various LVLMs for visual question answering and image captioning tasks, and experimental results not only verify our hypothesis but also reveal a consistent pattern of information flow convergence in the corresponding layers, and the information flow cliff layer will be different due to different contexts.

| **[Self-Comparison for Dataset-Level Membership Inference in Large (Vision-)Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13088v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant advancements in a wide range of natural language processing and vision-language tasks. Access to large web-scale datasets has been a key factor in their success. However, concerns have been raised about the unauthorized use of copyrighted materials and potential copyright infringement. Existing methods, such as sample-level Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) and distribution-based dataset inference, distinguish member data (data used for training) and non-member data by leveraging the common observation that models tend to memorize and show greater confidence in member data. Nevertheless, these methods face challenges when applied to LLMs and VLMs, such as the requirement for ground-truth member data or non-member data that shares the same distribution as the test data. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset-level membership inference method based on Self-Comparison. We find that a member prefix followed by a non-member suffix (paraphrased from a member suffix) can further trigger the model's memorization on training data. Instead of directly comparing member and non-member data, we introduce paraphrasing to the second half of the sequence and evaluate how the likelihood changes before and after paraphrasing. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require access to ground-truth member data or non-member data in identical distribution, making it more practical. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms traditional MIA and dataset inference techniques across various datasets and models, including including public models, fine-tuned models, and API-based commercial models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13085v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Fairness in Large Vision-Language Models Across Diverse Demographic Attributes and Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17974v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved significant progress, demonstrating strong capabilities in open-world visual understanding. However, it is not yet clear how LVLMs address demographic biases in real life, especially the disparities across attributes such as gender, skin tone, age and race. In this paper, We empirically investigate visual fairness in several mainstream LVLMs by auditing their performance disparities across demographic attributes using public fairness benchmark datasets (e.g., FACET, UTKFace). Our fairness evaluation framework employs direct and single-choice question prompt on visual question-answering/classification tasks. Despite advancements in visual understanding, our zero-shot prompting results show that both open-source and closed-source LVLMs continue to exhibit fairness issues across different prompts and demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a potential multi-modal Chain-of-thought (CoT) based strategy for bias mitigation, applicable to both open-source and closed-source LVLMs. This approach enhances transparency and offers a scalable solution for addressing fairness, providing a solid foundation for future bias reduction efforts.</p></details> | Under review |

In this paper, we evaluate the ability of generative VLMs to understand lexical and semantic changes in text using the SugarCrepe++ dataset. We analyze the sensitivity of VLMs to lexical alterations in prompts without corresponding semantic changes. Our findings demonstrate that generative VLMs are highly sensitive to such alterations. Additionally, we show that this vulnerability affects the performance of techniques aimed at achieving consistency in their outputs.</p></details> |  |

However, such models are tricky to efficiently train and often struggle to generalize beyond their training scenarios, limiting adaptability to new environments, tasks, and concepts. In this work, we investigate the minimal data requirements and architectural adaptations necessary to achieve robust closed-loop performance with vision-based control policies under unseen text instructions and visual distribution shifts. To this end, we design datasets with various levels of data representation richness, refine feature extraction protocols by leveraging multi-modal foundation model encoders, and assess the suitability of different policy network heads. Our findings are synthesized in Flex (Fly-lexically), a framework that uses pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) as frozen patch-wise feature extractors, generating spatially aware embeddings that integrate semantic and visual information. These rich features form the basis for training highly robust downstream policies capable of generalizing across platforms, environments, and text-specified tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on quadrotor fly-to-target tasks, where agents trained via behavior cloning on a small simulated dataset successfully generalize to real-world scenes, handling diverse novel goals and command formulations.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BlabberSeg, an optimized Vision-Language Model built on CLIPSeg for on-board, real-time processing of aerial images by UAVs. BlabberSeg improves the efficiency of CLIPSeg by reusing prompt and model features, reducing computational overhead while achieving real-time open-vocabulary aerial segmentation. We validated BlabberSeg in a safe landing scenario using the Dynamic Open-Vocabulary Enhanced SafE-Landing with Intelligence (DOVESEI) framework, which uses visual servoing and open-vocabulary segmentation. BlabberSeg reduces computational costs significantly, with a speed increase of 927.41% (16.78 Hz) on a NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX (64GB) compared with the original CLIPSeg (1.81Hz), achieving real-time aerial segmentation with negligible loss in accuracy (2.1% as the ratio of the correctly segmented area with respect to CLIPSeg). BlabberSeg's source code is open and available online.</p></details> |  |

Recently, researchers have applied this setting to advanced pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), developing approaches such as test-time prompt tuning to further extend their practical applicability. However, these methods typically focus solely on adapting VLMs from a single modality and fail to accumulate task-specific knowledge as more samples are processed. To address this, we introduce Dual Prototype Evolving (DPE), a novel test-time adaptation approach for VLMs that effectively accumulates task-specific knowledge from multi-modalities. Specifically, we create and evolve two sets of prototypes--textual and visual--to progressively capture more accurate multi-modal representations for target classes during test time. Moreover, to promote consistent multi-modal representations, we introduce and optimize learnable residuals for each test sample to align the prototypes from both modalities. Extensive experimental results on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed DPE consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while also exhibiting competitive computational efficiency.

Critical to their coexistence and cooperation with humans is the ability to understand natural language communications and exhibit human-like behaviors. This work focuses on generating diverse whole-body motions for humanoid robots from language descriptions. We leverage human motion priors from extensive human motion datasets to initialize humanoid motions and employ the commonsense reasoning capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to edit and refine these motions.

Multiple-choice question and answer (QA) datasets derived from national medical examinations have long served as valuable evaluation tools, but existing datasets are largely text-only and available in a limited subset of languages and countries. To address these challenges, we present WorldMedQA-V, an updated multilingual, multimodal benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate VLMs in healthcare. WorldMedQA-V includes 568 labeled multiple-choice QAs paired with 568 medical images from four countries (Brazil, Israel, Japan, and Spain), covering original languages and validated English translations by native clinicians, respectively. Baseline performance for common open- and closed-source models are provided in the local language and English translations, and with and without images provided to the model. The WorldMedQA-V benchmark aims to better match AI systems to the diverse healthcare environments in which they are deployed, fostering more equitable, effective, and representative applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for review, total of 14 pages</p></details> |

To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.</p></details> |  |
| **[VividMed: Vision Language Model with Versatile Visual Grounding for Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12694v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable promise in generating visually grounded responses. However, their application in the medical domain is hindered by unique challenges. For instance, most VLMs rely on a single method of visual grounding, whereas complex medical tasks demand more versatile approaches. Additionally, while most VLMs process only 2D images, a large portion of medical images are 3D. The lack of medical data further compounds these obstacles. To address these challenges, we present VividMed, a vision language model with versatile visual grounding for medicine. Our model supports generating both semantic segmentation masks and instance-level bounding boxes, and accommodates various imaging modalities, including both 2D and 3D data. We design a three-stage training procedure and an automatic data synthesis pipeline based on open datasets and models. Besides visual grounding tasks, VividMed also excels in other common downstream tasks, including Visual Question Answering (VQA) and report generation. Ablation studies empirically show that the integration of visual grounding ability leads to improved performance on these tasks.

| **[Understanding Figurative Meaning through Explainable Visual Entailment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01474v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks requiring a fine-grained understanding of literal meaning in images and text, such as visual question-answering or visual entailment. However, there has been little exploration of these models' capabilities when presented with images and captions containing figurative meaning, such as metaphors or humor. To close this gap, we propose a new task framing the figurative meaning understanding problem as an explainable visual entailment task, where the model has to predict whether the image (premise) entails a caption (hypothesis) and justify the predicted label with a textual explanation. The figurative phenomena can be present either in the image, the caption, or both. Utilizing a human-AI collaboration approach, we build the accompanying expert-verified dataset V-FLUTE, containing 6,027 {image, caption, label, explanation} instances spanning five diverse figurative phenomena: metaphors, similes, idioms, sarcasm, and humor. Through automatic evaluation, we find that VLMs struggle to generalize from literal to figurative meaning, particularly when it is present in images. Further, we identify common types of errors in VLM reasoning via human evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Modal Safety Mechanism Transfer in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12662v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language alignment in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) successfully enables LLMs to understand visual input. However, we find that existing vision-language alignment methods fail to transfer the existing safety mechanism for text in LLMs to vision, which leads to vulnerabilities in toxic image. To explore the cause of this problem, we give the insightful explanation of where and how the safety mechanism of LVLMs operates and conduct comparative analysis between text and vision. We find that the hidden states at the specific transformer layers play a crucial role in the successful activation of safety mechanism, while the vision-language alignment at hidden states level in current methods is insufficient. This results in a semantic shift for input images compared to text in hidden states, therefore misleads the safety mechanism. To address this, we propose a novel Text-Guided vision-language Alignment method (TGA) for LVLMs. TGA retrieves the texts related to input vision and uses them to guide the projection of vision into the hidden states space in LLMs. Experiments show that TGA not only successfully transfers the safety mechanism for text in basic LLMs to vision in vision-language alignment for LVLMs without any safety fine-tuning on the visual modality but also maintains the general performance on various vision tasks (Safe and Good).</p></details> |  |

However, detecting an object's state and generating a state-sensitive plan for robots is challenging. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plans. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is hardly any investigation on whether LLMs or VLMs can also generate object state-sensitive plans. To study this, we introduce an Object State-Sensitive Agent (OSSA), a task-planning agent empowered by pre-trained neural networks. We propose two methods for OSSA: (i) a modular model consisting of a pre-trained vision processing module (dense captioning model, DCM) and a natural language processing model (LLM), and (ii) a monolithic model consisting only of a VLM. To quantitatively evaluate the performances of the two methods, we use tabletop scenarios where the task is to clear the table. We contribute a multimodal benchmark dataset that takes object states into consideration. Our results show that both methods can be used for object state-sensitive tasks, but the monolithic approach outperforms the modular approach.

Despite the varying significance of different textual elements within a sentence depending on the context, efforts to account for variation of importance in constructing text embeddings have been lacking. We propose a framework of Semantic Token Reweighting to build Interpretable text embeddings (SToRI), which incorporates controllability as well. SToRI refines the text encoding process in CLIP by differentially weighting semantic elements based on contextual importance, enabling finer control over emphasis responsive to data-driven insights and user preferences. The efficacy of SToRI is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on few-shot image classification and image retrieval tailored to user preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

However, current benchmarks focus on tasks that evaluating only a single aspect of LVLM capabilities (e.g., recognition, detection, understanding). These tasks fail to fully demonstrate LVLMs' potential in complex application scenarios. To comprehensively assess the performance of existing LVLMs, we propose a more challenging task called the Flow Text with Image Insertion task (FTII). This task requires LVLMs to simultaneously possess outstanding abilities in image comprehension, instruction understanding, and long-text interpretation. Specifically, given several text paragraphs and a set of candidate images, as the text paragraphs accumulate, the LVLMs are required to select the most suitable image from the candidates to insert after the corresponding paragraph. Constructing a benchmark for such a task is highly challenging, particularly in determining the sequence of flowing text and images. To address this challenge, we turn to professional news reports, which naturally contain a gold standard for image-text sequences. Based on this, we introduce the Flow Text with Image Insertion Benchmark (FTII-Bench), which includes 318 high-quality Chinese image-text news articles and 307 high-quality English image-text news articles, covering 10 different news domains. Using these 625 high-quality articles, we construct problems of two different types with multiple levels of difficulty. Furthermore, we establish two different evaluation pipelines based on the CLIP model and existing LVLMs. We evaluate 9 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs as well as 2 CLIP-based models. Results indicate that even the most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4o) face significant challenges when tackling the FTII task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress. 9 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Experts Made Personalized: Federated Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10114v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning for pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP has demonstrated potent applicability across diverse downstream tasks. This lightweight approach has quickly gained traction from federated learning (FL) researchers who seek to efficiently adapt VLMs to heterogeneous scenarios. However, current federated prompt learning methods are habitually restricted to the traditional FL paradigm, where the participating clients are generally only allowed to download a single globally aggregated model from the server. While justifiable for training full-sized models under federated settings, in this work, we argue that this paradigm is ill-suited for lightweight prompts. By facilitating the clients to download multiple pre-aggregated prompts as fixed non-local experts, we propose Personalized Federated Mixture of Adaptive Prompts (pFedMoAP), a novel FL framework that personalizes the prompt learning process through the lens of Mixture of Experts (MoE). pFedMoAP implements a local attention-based gating network that learns to generate enhanced text features for better alignment with local image data on the client, benefiting from both local and downloaded non-local adaptive prompt experts. The non-local experts are sparsely selected from a server-maintained pool, fostering collaborative learning across clients. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments across 9 datasets under various heterogeneous federated settings. The results show that pFedMoAP consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives, underscoring its efficacy in personalizing prompt learning for CLIP within the federated learning paradigm.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

These models embed multimodal facts within their parameters, rather than relying on external knowledge bases to store factual information explicitly. However, the content discerned by LVLMs may deviate from actual facts due to inherent bias or incorrect inference. To address this issue, we introduce MFC-Bench, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the factual accuracy of LVLMs across three stages of verdict prediction for MFC: Manipulation, Out-of-Context, and Veracity Classification. Through our evaluation on MFC-Bench, we benchmarked a dozen diverse and representative LVLMs, uncovering that current models still fall short in multimodal fact-checking and demonstrate insensitivity to various forms of manipulated content. We hope that MFC-Bench could raise attention to the trustworthy AI potentially assisted by LVLMs in the future. The MFC-Bench and accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://github.com/wskbest/MFC-Bench, contributing to ongoing research in the multimodal fact-checking field.</p></details> | 28 pages, 9 figures |

Previous works primarily focus on prompt learning to adapt the CLIP into a variety of downstream tasks, however, suffering from task overfitting when fine-tuned on a small data set. In this paper, we introduce an orthogonal fine-tuning method for efficiently fine-tuning pretrained weights and enabling enhanced robustness and generalization, while a self-regularization strategy is further exploited to maintain the stability in terms of zero-shot generalization of VLMs, dubbed OrthSR. Specifically, trainable orthogonal matrices are injected seamlessly into the transformer architecture and enforced with orthogonality constraint during the training, benefiting from the norm-preserving property and thus leading to stable and faster convergence, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen. To alleviate deviation from fine-tuning, a self-regularization strategy is further employed to retain the generalization of the model during the training within a bypass manner. In addition, to enrich the sample diversity for downstream tasks under the small dataset scenario, we first explore attentive CutOut data augmentation to boost the efficient fine-tuning, leading to better model fitting capacity for specific downstream task. Then we support the theoretical analysis on how our approach improves the specific downstream performance and maintains the generalizability. For the first time, we revisit the CLIP and CoOp with our method to effectively improve the model on few-shot image classficiation scenario on par with the elaborated prompt learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Large-scale pre-training plays a critical role in building capable LVLMs, while evaluating its training quality without the costly supervised fine-tuning stage is under-explored. Loss, perplexity, and in-context evaluation results are commonly used pre-training metrics for Large Language Models (LLMs), while we observed that these metrics are less indicative when aligning a well-trained LLM with a new modality. Due to the lack of proper metrics, the research of LVLMs in the critical pre-training stage is hindered greatly, including the training data choice, efficient module design, etc. In this paper, we propose evaluating the pre-training quality from the inter-modal distribution distance perspective and present MIR, the Modality Integration Rate, which is 1) \textbf{Effective} to represent the pre-training quality and show a positive relation with the benchmark performance after supervised fine-tuning. 2) \textbf{Robust} toward different training/evaluation data. 3) \textbf{Generalize} across training configurations and architecture choices. We conduct a series of pre-training experiments to explore the effectiveness of MIR and observe satisfactory results that MIR is indicative about training data selection, training strategy schedule, and model architecture design to get better pre-training results.

TCA bridges distribution gaps at the patch level by condensing image tokens that exhibit low attentiveness to the <cls> token. Recognizing the <cls> token may correspond to universal concepts, TCA identifies and tracks the most reliable <cls> tokens that align specifically with target classes from historical data streams. To achieve this, we propose a context token reservoir (CTR), which retains tokens with the lowest uncertainty as ``anchors" to guide the preservation of class-relevant tokens during inference. These anchors, in turn, act as token-level classifiers to correct VLM predictions and improve visual-text alignment. Utilizing anchors sampled from CTR, TCA condenses tokens through two operations: (1) pruning class-irrelevant tokens that consistently rank low across all attention heads to reach cross-head consensus on their irrelevance, and (2) merging the remaining class-ambiguous tokens into representative centers using coreset selection, maintaining linear computational complexity. As the first method to explore token efficiency in test-time adaptation, TCA consistently demonstrates superior performance across cross-dataset and out-of-distribution adaptation tasks, reducing GFLOPs by 12.2% to 48.9% while achieving accuracy improvements up to 21.4% against the strongest baseline without introducing additional parameters.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

Given the significant risk of head injuries in construction, proper enforcement of hardhat use is critical.

Experimental results on 5,210 images demonstrate that the OWLv2 model achieves an average precision of 0.6493 for hardhat detection. We further analyze the limitations and potential improvements for real-world applications, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current foundation models in safety perception domains.</p></details> |  |

To ensure software quality and user experience, various techniques have been proposed to automatically test web applications by interacting with their GUIs. To achieve high functional coverage, web GUI testing tools often need to generate high-quality text inputs and interact with the associated GUI elements (e.g., click submit buttons). However, developing a holistic approach that solves both subtasks is challenging because the web GUI context can be complicated and highly dynamic, which makes it hard to process programmatically. The recent development of large vision-language models (LVLM) provides new opportunities to handle these longstanding problems. This paper proposes VETL, the first LVLM-driven end-to-end web testing technique. With LVLM's scene understanding capabilities, VETL can generate valid and meaningful text inputs focusing on the local context, while avoiding the need to extract precise textual attributes. The selection of associated GUI elements is formulated as a visual question-answering problem, allowing LVLM to capture the logical connection between the input box and the relevant element based on visual instructions. Further, the GUI exploration is guided by a multi-armed bandit module employing a curiosity-oriented strategy. Experiments show that VETL effectively explores web state/action spaces and detects bugs. Compared with WebExplor, the state-of-the-art web testing technique, VETL can discover 25% more unique web actions on benchmark websites. Moreover, it can expose functional bugs in top-ranking commercial websites, which the website maintainers have confirmed. Our work makes the first attempt at leveraging LVLM in end-to-end GUI testing, demonstrating promising results in this research direction.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel, generalizable methodology to identify preferred image distributions for black-box Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by measuring output consistency across varied input prompts. Applying this to different rendering types of 3D objects, we demonstrate its efficacy across various domains requiring precise interpretation of complex structures, with a focus on Computer-Aided Design (CAD) as an exemplar field. We further refine VLM outputs using in-context learning with human feedback, significantly enhancing explanation quality. To address the lack of benchmarks in specialized domains, we introduce CAD-VQA, a new dataset for evaluating VLMs on CAD-related visual question answering tasks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs on CAD-VQA establishes baseline performance levels, providing a framework for advancing VLM capabilities in complex visual reasoning tasks across various fields requiring expert-level visual interpretation.

| **[Autonomous Improvement of Instruction Following Skills via Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20635v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent instruction-following robots capable of improving from autonomously collected experience have the potential to transform robot learning: instead of collecting costly teleoperated demonstration data, large-scale deployment of fleets of robots can quickly collect larger quantities of autonomous data that can collectively improve their performance. However, autonomous improvement requires solving two key problems: (i) fully automating a scalable data collection procedure that can collect diverse and semantically meaningful robot data and (ii) learning from non-optimal, autonomous data with no human annotations. To this end, we propose a novel approach that addresses these challenges, allowing instruction-following policies to improve from autonomously collected data without human supervision. Our framework leverages vision-language models to collect and evaluate semantically meaningful experiences in new environments, and then utilizes a decomposition of instruction following tasks into (semantic) language-conditioned image generation and (non-semantic) goal reaching, which makes it significantly more practical to improve from this autonomously collected data without any human annotations. We carry out extensive experiments in the real world to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and find that in a suite of unseen environments, the robot policy can be improved 2x with autonomously collected data. We open-source the code for our semantic autonomous improvement pipeline, as well as our autonomous dataset of 30.5K trajectories collected across five tabletop environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Low-shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation via Representer Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11686v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of pre-trained vision-language foundation models has revolutionized the field of zero/few-shot (i.e., low-shot) image recognition. The key challenge to address under the condition of limited training data is how to fine-tune pre-trained vision-language models in a parameter-efficient manner. Previously, numerous approaches tackling this challenge have been proposed. Meantime, a few survey papers are also published to summarize these works. However, there still lacks a unified computational framework to integrate existing methods together, identify their nature and support in-depth comparison. As such, this survey paper first proposes a unified computational framework from the perspective of Representer Theorem and then derives many of the existing methods by specializing this framework. Thereafter, a comparative analysis is conducted to uncover the differences and relationships between existing methods. Based on the analyses, some possible variants to improve the existing works are presented. As a demonstration, we extend existing methods by modeling inter-class correlation between representers in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which is implemented by exploiting the closed-form solution of kernel ridge regression. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of this method. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the limitations and provide further research directions.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning usually requires 'white-box' access to the model's architecture and weights, which is not always feasible due to proprietary or privacy concerns. In this work, we propose LLM-wrapper, a method for 'black-box' adaptation of VLMs for the REC task using Large Language Models (LLMs). LLM-wrapper capitalizes on the reasoning abilities of LLMs, improved with a light fine-tuning, to select the most relevant bounding box matching the referring expression, from candidates generated by a zero-shot black-box VLM. Our approach offers several advantages: it enables the adaptation of closed-source models without needing access to their internal workings, it is versatile as it works with any VLM, it transfers to new VLMs, and it allows for the adaptation of an ensemble of VLMs. We evaluate LLM-wrapper on multiple datasets using different VLMs and LLMs, demonstrating significant performance improvements and highlighting the versatility of our method. While LLM-wrapper is not meant to directly compete with standard white-box fine-tuning, it offers a practical and effective alternative for black-box VLM adaptation. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1 at...</summary><p>v1 at EVAL-FoMo workshop, ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, existing video retrieval datasets suffer from scope limitations, primarily focusing on matching descriptive but vague queries with small collections of professionally edited, English-centric videos. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiVENT 2.0}$, a large-scale, multilingual event-centric video retrieval benchmark featuring a collection of more than 218,000 news videos and 3,906 queries targeting specific world events. These queries specifically target information found in the visual content, audio, embedded text, and text metadata of the videos, requiring systems leverage all these sources to succeed at the task. Preliminary results show that state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle significantly with this task, and while alternative approaches show promise, they are still insufficient to adequately address this problem. These findings underscore the need for more robust multimodal retrieval systems, as effective video retrieval is a crucial step towards multimodal content understanding and generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Based on a large-scale pre-trained Vision Language Model (VLM), our model learns and improves visual, textual, and numerical representations of patient gait videos, through a collective learning across three distinct modalities: gait videos, class-specific descriptions, and numerical gait parameters. Our specific contributions are two-fold: First, we adopt a knowledge-aware prompt tuning strategy to utilize the class-specific medical description in guiding the text prompt learning. Second, we integrate the paired gait parameters in the form of numerical texts to enhance the numeracy of the textual representation. Results demonstrate that our model not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video-based classification tasks but also adeptly decodes the learned class-specific text features into natural language descriptions using the vocabulary of quantitative gait parameters.

Although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have excelled in high-level reasoning and long-horizon planning for robotic manipulation, they still fall short in grasping the nuanced physical properties required for effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce PAVLM (Point cloud Affordance Vision-Language Model), an innovative framework that utilizes the extensive multimodal knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to enhance 3D affordance understanding of point cloud. PAVLM integrates a geometric-guided propagation module with hidden embeddings from large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual semantics. On the language side, we prompt Llama-3.1 models to generate refined context-aware text, augmenting the instructional input with deeper semantic cues. Experimental results on the 3D-AffordanceNet benchmark demonstrate that PAVLM outperforms baseline methods for both full and partial point clouds, particularly excelling in its generalization to novel open-world affordance tasks of 3D objects.

In this work, we introduce relevance hallucination and factuality hallucination as a new typology for hallucination problems brought by query generation based on LLMs. We propose an effective way to separate content from form in LLM-generated queries, which preserves the factual knowledge extracted and integrated from the inputs and compiles the syntactic structure, including function words, using the powerful linguistic capabilities of the LLM. Specifically, we introduce a model-agnostic and training-free method that turns the Large Language Model into a Pointer-Generator (LargePiG), where the pointer attention distribution leverages the LLM's inherent attention weights, and the copy probability is derived from the difference between the vocabulary distribution of the model's high layers and the last layer. To validate the effectiveness of LargePiG, we constructed two datasets for assessing the hallucination problems in query generation, covering both document and video scenarios. Empirical studies on various LLMs demonstrated the superiority of LargePiG on both datasets. Additional experiments also verified that LargePiG could reduce hallucination in large vision language models and improve the accuracy of document-based question-answering and factuality evaluation tasks.</p></details> | 24 pages |

In this paper, we empirically investigate what text prompt encoders (e.g., CLIP or LLM) are good for adapting SAM for referring expression segmentation and introduce the Early Vision-language Fusion-based SAM (EVF-SAM). EVF-SAM is a simple yet effective referring segmentation method which exploits multimodal prompts (i.e., image and text) and comprises a pre-trained vision-language model to generate referring prompts and a SAM model for segmentation. Surprisingly, we observe that: (1) multimodal prompts and (2) vision-language models with early fusion (e.g., BEIT-3) are beneficial for prompting SAM for accurate referring segmentation. Our experiments show that the proposed EVF-SAM based on BEIT-3 can obtain state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO/+/g for referring expression segmentation and demonstrate the superiority of prompting SAM with early vision-language fusion. In addition, the proposed EVF-SAM with 1.32B parameters achieves remarkably higher performance while reducing nearly 82% of parameters compared to previous SAM methods based on large multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Existing image database retrieval methods are limited by the impracticality of storing sufficient visual records of global landmarks. Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated the capability of geo-localization through Visual Question Answering (VQA), enabling a solution that does not require external geo-tagged image records. However, the performance of a single LVLM is still limited by its intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce smileGeo, a novel visual geo-localization framework that leverages multiple Internet-enabled LVLM agents operating within an agent-based architecture. By facilitating inter-agent communication, smileGeo integrates the inherent knowledge of these agents with additional retrieved information, enhancing the ability to effectively localize images. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a dynamic learning strategy that optimizes agent communication, reducing redundant interactions and enhancing overall system efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted experiments on three different datasets, and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

| **[CLIP-DFGS: A Hard Sample Mining Method for CLIP in Generalizable Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11255v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise in person re-identification (ReID) applications. However, their performance in generalizable person re-identification tasks remains suboptimal. The large-scale and diverse image-text pairs used in CLIP's pre-training may lead to a lack or insufficiency of certain fine-grained features. In light of these challenges, we propose a hard sample mining method called DFGS (Depth-First Graph Sampler), based on depth-first search, designed to offer sufficiently challenging samples to enhance CLIP's ability to extract fine-grained features. DFGS can be applied to both the image encoder and the text encoder in CLIP. By leveraging the powerful cross-modal learning capabilities of CLIP, we aim to apply our DFGS method to extract challenging samples and form mini-batches with high discriminative difficulty, providing the image model with more efficient and challenging samples that are difficult to distinguish, thereby enhancing the model's ability to differentiate between individuals. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over other methods, confirming the effectiveness of DFGS in providing challenging samples that enhance CLIP's performance in generalizable person re-identification.</p></details> | Accepted by ACM TOMM |
| **[Tree of Attributes Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11201v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has proven effective in adapting vision language models for downstream tasks. However, existing methods usually append learnable prompt tokens solely with the category names to obtain textual features, which fails to fully leverage the rich context indicated in the category name. To address this issue, we propose the Tree of Attributes Prompt learning (TAP), which first instructs LLMs to generate a tree of attributes with a "concept - attribute - description" structure for each category, and then learn the hierarchy with vision and text prompt tokens. Unlike existing methods that merely augment category names with a set of unstructured descriptions, our approach essentially distills structured knowledge graphs associated with class names from LLMs. Furthermore, our approach introduces text and vision prompts designed to explicitly learn the corresponding visual attributes, effectively serving as domain experts. Additionally, the general and diverse descriptions generated based on the class names may be wrong or absent in the specific given images. To address this misalignment, we further introduce a vision-conditional pooling module to extract instance-specific text features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, as well as few-shot classification across 11 diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoAgent: Self-Improving Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10076v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has been used to generate visual plans for controlling robotic systems. Given an image observation and a language instruction, previous work has generated video plans which are then converted to robot controls to be executed. However, a major bottleneck in leveraging video generation for control lies in the quality of the generated videos, which often suffer from hallucinatory content and unrealistic physics, resulting in low task success when control actions are extracted from the generated videos. While scaling up dataset and model size provides a partial solution, integrating external feedback is both natural and essential for grounding video generation in the real world. With this observation, we propose VideoAgent for self-improving generated video plans based on external feedback. Instead of directly executing the generated video plan, VideoAgent first refines the generated video plans using a novel procedure which we call self-conditioning consistency, utilizing feedback from a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). As the refined video plan is being executed, VideoAgent collects additional data from the environment to further improve video plan generation. Experiments in simulated robotic manipulation from MetaWorld and iTHOR show that VideoAgent drastically reduces hallucination, thereby boosting success rate of downstream manipulation tasks. We further illustrate that VideoAgent can effectively refine real-robot videos, providing an early indicator that robotics can be an effective tool in grounding video generation in the physical world.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to reason about spatial arrangements remains limited. In this work, we introduce Spatial Region GPT (SpatialRGPT) to enhance VLMs' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. SpatialRGPT advances VLMs' spatial understanding through two key innovations: (1) a data curation pipeline that enables effective learning of regional representation from 3D scene graphs, and (2) a flexible plugin module for integrating depth information into the visual encoder of existing VLMs. During inference, when provided with user-specified region proposals, SpatialRGPT can accurately perceive their relative directions and distances. Additionally, we propose SpatialRGBT-Bench, a benchmark with ground-truth 3D annotations encompassing indoor, outdoor, and simulated environments, for evaluating 3D spatial cognition in VLMs. Our results demonstrate that SpatialRGPT significantly enhances performance in spatial reasoning tasks, both with and without local region prompts. The model also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, effectively reasoning about complex spatial relations and functioning as a region-aware dense reward annotator for robotic tasks.

Limited by resource and application constrains, only sparsely-distributed transducer arrays can be applied, which necessitates advanced image reconstruction algorithms to overcome artifacts caused by using back-projection algorithm. However, high computing memory consumption of traditional iterative algorithms for large-scale 3D cases is practically unacceptable. Here, we propose a point cloud-based iterative algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein a 3D photoacoustic scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources. During the iterative reconstruction process, the properties of each Gaussian source, including peak intensities, standard deviations and means are stored in form of point cloud, then continuously optimized and adaptively undergoing destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction, thus manifesting the sliding ball adaptive growth effect. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality 3D large-scale PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely less memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging Systems: The Bayesian Cramér-Rao Bound Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09557v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution imaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and blood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v3)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training.

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively.

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for thae creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Main Track</p></details> |

These agent-based systems represent an emerging shift in personal computing. We contribute to the security foundations of agent-based systems and surface a new class of automatically computed obfuscated adversarial prompt attacks that violate the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to an LLM agent. We show how prompt optimization techniques can find such prompts automatically given the weights of a model. We demonstrate that such attacks transfer to production-level agents. For example, we show an information exfiltration attack on Mistral's LeChat agent that analyzes a user's conversation, picks out personally identifiable information, and formats it into a valid markdown command that results in leaking that data to the attacker's server. This attack shows a nearly 80% success rate in an end-to-end evaluation. We conduct a range of experiments to characterize the efficacy of these attacks and find that they reliably work on emerging agent-based systems like Mistral's LeChat, ChatGLM, and Meta's Llama. These attacks are multimodal, and we show variants in the text-only and image domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website: imprompter.ai code: https://github.com/Reapor-Yurnero/imprompter</p></details> |
| **[SPRIG: Improving Large Language Model Performance by System Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14826v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in many scenarios, but their performance depends, in part, on the choice of prompt. Past research has focused on optimizing prompts specific to a task. However, much less attention has been given to optimizing the general instructions included in a prompt, known as a system prompt. To address this gap, we propose SPRIG, an edit-based genetic algorithm that iteratively constructs prompts from prespecified components to maximize the model's performance in general scenarios. We evaluate the performance of system prompts on a collection of 47 different types of tasks to ensure generalizability. Our study finds that a single optimized system prompt performs on par with task prompts optimized for each individual task. Moreover, combining system and task-level optimizations leads to further improvement, which showcases their complementary nature. Experiments also reveal that the optimized system prompts generalize effectively across model families, parameter sizes, and languages. This study provides insights into the role of system-level instructions in maximizing LLM potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[MORL-Prompt: An Empirical Analysis of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Discrete Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11711v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RL-based techniques can be employed to search for prompts that, when fed into a target language model, maximize a set of user-specified reward functions. However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize the volume of the Pareto reward surface perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce "Survival of the Safest" (SoS), an innovative multi-objective prompt optimization framework that enhances both performance and security in LLMs simultaneously. SoS utilizes an interleaved multi-objective evolution strategy, integrating semantic, feedback, and crossover mutations to effectively traverse the prompt landscape. Differing from the computationally demanding Pareto front methods, SoS provides a scalable solution that expedites optimization in complex, high-dimensional discrete search spaces while keeping computational demands low. Our approach accommodates flexible weighting of objectives and generates a pool of optimized candidates, empowering users to select prompts that optimally meet their specific performance and security needs. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets affirm SoS's efficacy in delivering high performance and notably enhancing safety and security compared to single-objective methods. This advancement marks a significant stride towards the deployment of LLM systems that are both high-performing and secure across varied industrial applications</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |

When dealing with complex issues, prompt engineers tend to distill multiple patterns from examples and inject relevant solutions to optimize the prompts, achieving satisfying results. However, existing automatic prompt optimization techniques are only limited to producing single flow instructions, struggling with handling diverse patterns. In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning. In experiments across five tasks, AMPO consistently achieves the best results. Additionally, our approach demonstrates significant optimization efficiency due to our adoption of a minimal search strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

While existing prompt optimization methods improve prompt effectiveness, they often lead to prompt drifting, where newly generated prompts can adversely impact previously successful cases while addressing failures. Furthermore, these methods tend to rely heavily on LLMs' intrinsic capabilities for prompt optimization tasks. In this paper, we introduce StraGo (Strategic-Guided Optimization), a novel approach designed to mitigate prompt drifting by leveraging insights from both successful and failed cases to identify critical factors for achieving optimization objectives. StraGo employs a how-to-do methodology, integrating in-context learning to formulate specific, actionable strategies that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for prompt optimization. Extensive experiments conducted across a range of tasks, including reasoning, natural language understanding, domain-specific knowledge, and industrial applications, demonstrate StraGo's superior performance.

Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

While contemporary frontier LLMs are capable enough to power reasonably good Language agents, the closed-API model makes it hard to improve in cases they perform sub-optimally. To address this, recent works have explored ways to improve their performance using techniques like self-reflection and prompt optimization. Unfortunately, techniques like self-reflection can be used only in an online setup, while contemporary prompt optimization techniques are designed and tested to work on simple tasks. To this end, we introduce MetaReflection, a novel offline reinforcement learning technique that enhances the performance of Language Agents by augmenting a semantic memory based on experiential learnings from past trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of MetaReflection by evaluating across multiple domains, including complex logical reasoning, biomedical semantic similarity, open world question answering, and vulnerability threat detection, in Infrastructure-as-Code, spanning different agent designs. MetaReflection boosts Language agents' performance by 4% to 16.82% over the raw GPT-4 baseline and performs on par with existing state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques while requiring fewer LLM calls.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release our experimental code at: https://aka.ms/metareflection-code</p></details> |

However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4\% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA.</p></details> |  |

Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

These compound systems often lack intermediate labels or gradient flow to optimize each module, making their end-to-end optimization challenging. Here we seek strategies to optimize both the module-level LM weights and the associated prompt templates of such systems to maximize a downstream task metric. We propose for the first time combining the weight and prompt optimization strategies to optimize a modular LM pipeline by alternating between the two to get the same LM to teach itself. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification using mistral-7b, llama-2-7b, and llama-3-8b, these BetterTogether strategies optimizing the weights and prompts of a pipeline together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 60% and 6%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks.

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel algorithm for optimizing LM programs. MIPRO outperforms baseline optimizers on five of seven diverse multi-stage LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 13% accuracy.

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST) that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

Through a feedback-driven critique and synthesis process, PromptWizard achieves an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, iteratively refining both prompt instructions and in-context examples to generate human-readable, task-specific prompts. This guided approach systematically improves prompt quality, resulting in superior performance across 45 tasks. PromptWizard excels even with limited training data, smaller LLMs, and various LLM architectures.

In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights.

However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study is a step in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functional code generation, supporting their integration into real-world software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, CCS 2024</p></details> |

Teaching Humans to Articulate Requirements for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08775v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting ChatGPT to achieve complex goals (e.g., creating a customer support chatbot) often demands meticulous prompt engineering, including aspects like fluent writing and chain-of-thought techniques. While emerging prompt optimizers can automatically refine many of these aspects, we argue that clearly conveying customized requirements (e.g., how to handle diverse inputs) remains a human-centric challenge. In this work, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a study with 30 novices, we show that requirement-focused training doubles novices' prompting performance, significantly outperforming conventional prompt engineering training and prompt optimization. We also demonstrate that high-quality LLM outputs are directly tied to the quality of input requirements. Our work paves the way for more effective task delegation in human-LLM collaborative prompting.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Human-Free Automated Prompting for Vision-Language Anomaly Detection: Prompt Optimization with Meta-guiding Prompt Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18197v4)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) are highly adaptable to various downstream tasks through few-shot learning, making prompt-based anomaly detection a promising approach. Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Robot Failure Recovery Using Vision-Language Models With Optimized Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03966v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current robot autonomy struggles to operate beyond the assumed Operational Design Domain (ODD), the specific set of conditions and environments in which the system is designed to function, while the real-world is rife with uncertainties that may lead to failures. Automating recovery remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods often rely on human intervention to manually address failures or require exhaustive enumeration of failure cases and the design of specific recovery policies for each scenario, both of which are labor-intensive. Foundational Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which demonstrate remarkable common-sense generalization and reasoning capabilities, have broader, potentially unbounded ODDs. However, limitations in spatial reasoning continue to be a common challenge for many VLMs when applied to robot control and motion-level error recovery. In this paper, we investigate how optimizing visual and text prompts can enhance the spatial reasoning of VLMs, enabling them to function effectively as black-box controllers for both motion-level position correction and task-level recovery from unknown failures. Specifically, the optimizations include identifying key visual elements in visual prompts, highlighting these elements in text prompts for querying, and decomposing the reasoning process for failure detection and control generation. In experiments, prompt optimizations significantly outperform pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models in correcting motion-level position errors and improve accuracy by 65.78% compared to VLMs with unoptimized prompts. Additionally, for task-level failures, optimized prompts enhanced the success rate by 5.8%, 5.8%, and 7.5% in VLMs' abilities to detect failures, analyze issues, and generate recovery plans, respectively, across a wide range of unknown errors in Lego assembly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Twice Before Recognizing: Large Multimodal Models for General Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new strategy called think twice before recognizing to improve fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR). Fine-grained TSR in the wild is difficult due to the complex road conditions, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR when data is lacking. Our strategy achieves effective fine-grained TSR by stimulating the multiple-thinking capability of large multimodal models (LMM). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for the LMM. The context descriptions with center coordinate prompt optimization help the LMM to locate the target traffic sign in the original road images containing multiple traffic signs and filter irrelevant answers through the proposed prior traffic sign hypothesis. The characteristic description is based on few-shot in-context learning of template traffic signs, which decreases the cross-domain difference and enhances the fine-grained recognition capability of the LMM. The differential descriptions of similar traffic signs optimize the multimodal thinking capability of the LMM. The proposed method is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art TSR results on all five datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiverseDialogue: A Methodology for Designing Chatbots with Human-Like Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00262v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), which simulate human users, are frequently employed to evaluate chatbots in applications such as tutoring and customer service. Effective evaluation necessitates a high degree of human-like diversity within these simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that conversations generated by GPT-4o mini, when used as simulated human participants, systematically differ from those between actual humans across multiple linguistic features. These features include topic variation, lexical attributes, and both the average behavior and diversity (variance) of the language used. To address these discrepancies, we propose an approach that automatically generates prompts for user simulations by incorporating features derived from real human interactions, such as age, gender, emotional tone, and the topics discussed. We assess our approach using differential language analysis combined with deep linguistic inquiry. Our method of prompt optimization, tailored to target specific linguistic features, shows significant improvements. Specifically, it enhances the human-likeness of LLM chatbot conversations, increasing their linguistic diversity. On average, we observe a 54 percent reduction in the error of average features between human and LLM-generated conversations. This method of constructing chatbot sets with human-like diversity holds great potential for enhancing the evaluation process of user-facing bots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Safety Response Boundary of Large Language Models via Unsafe Decoding Path Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10668v3)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are implicit troublemakers. While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |
| **[DAAD: Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator for Fake News Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10883v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In current web environment, fake news spreads rapidly across online social networks, posing serious threats to society. Existing multimodal fake news detection (MFND) methods can be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are overly dependent on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Putting People in LLMs' Shoes: Generating Better Answers via Question Rewriter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10573v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities, particularly in the domain of question answering (QA). However, their effectiveness in QA is often undermined by the vagueness of user questions. To address this issue, we introduce single-round instance-level prompt optimization, referred to as question rewriter. By enhancing the intelligibility of human questions for black-box LLMs, our question rewriter improves the quality of generated answers. The rewriter is optimized using direct preference optimization based on feedback collected from automatic criteria for evaluating generated answers; therefore, its training does not require costly human annotations. The experiments across multiple black-box LLMs and long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. This paper provides a practical framework for training question rewriters and sets a precedent for future explorations in prompt optimization within LFQA tasks.

However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs. In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization (QPO), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM. We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions. Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts. Experiments on various LLM scales and diverse NLP and math tasks demonstrate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of our method in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept Distillation from Strong to Weak Models via Hypotheses-to-Theories Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09365v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-crafting high quality prompts to optimize the performance of language models is a complicated and labor-intensive process. Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

| **[Large Language Models Prompting With Episodic Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07465v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization is essential for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in scenarios of few-shot learning where training examples are incorporated directly into the prompt. Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose FUSE (Flexible Unification of Semantic Embeddings), an inexpensive approach to approximating an adapter layer that maps from one model's textual embedding space to another, even across different tokenizers. We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space. We show the efficacy of our approach via multi-objective optimization over vision-language and causal language models for image captioning and sentiment-based image captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a Conference Paper at COLM 2024; 10 Pages; https://github.com/jnwilliams/FUSE_prompt_inversion.git</p></details> |

As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024)</p></details> |

Our experiments and evaluation conclude that GPT-4 outperforms other models and can overcome inconsistencies in data through internal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, through expert analysis, we infer that reference-free evaluation metrics such as G-Eval and Prometheus demonstrate reliability closely aligned with that of human evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Prompt Optimizer for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10882v4)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have shown great performance in generating images based on textual prompts. However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |

The existing research primarily emphasizes the importance of adapting prompts to specific tasks, rather than specific LLMs. However, a good prompt is not solely defined by its wording, but also binds to the nature of the LLM in question. In this work, we first quantitatively demonstrate that different prompts should be adapted to different LLMs to enhance their capabilities across various downstream tasks in NLP. Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively refine prompts for an LLM, leading to significant improvements over various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2023 (Findings)</p></details> |

The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |

Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization.

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Prompt Program Search: A Structure-Aware Approach to Efficient Compile-Time Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02319v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many modern LLM applications, such as retrieval augmented generation, prompts have become programs themselves. In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |
| **[LoPT: Low-Rank Prompt Tuning for Parameter Efficient Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19486v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In prompt tuning, a prefix or suffix text is added to the prompt, and the embeddings (soft prompts) or token indices (hard prompts) of the prefix/suffix are optimized to gain more control over language models for specific tasks. This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01606v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first gradient-based framework for prompt optimization in text-to-image diffusion models. We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

| **[Autonomous Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11000v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a crucial yet challenging task for optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on customized tasks. This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET), which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts, resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4% increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a significant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16743v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace is the New AutoDiff -- Unlocking Efficient Optimization of Computational Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16218v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. We propose an end-to-end optimization framework, Trace, which treats the computational workflow of an AI system as a graph akin to neural networks, based on a generalization of back-propagation. Optimization of computational workflows often involves rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, hyper-parameters, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). Moreover, its computation graph can change dynamically with the inputs and parameters. We frame a new mathematical setup of iterative optimization, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), to capture and abstract these properties so as to design optimizers that work across many domains. In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. Trace is the tool to implement OPTO in practice. Trace has a Python interface that efficiently converts a computational workflow into an OPTO instance using a PyTorch-like interface. Using Trace, we develop a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime that can effectively solve OPTO problems. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We believe that Trace, OptoPrime and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar selection, ES). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO recently receiving more research attention. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and ES techniques, both isolation and combination, on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars consistently improves performance over IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with ES strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe synergy between ES and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar selection as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remains a crucial aspect of APO and deserves greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04155v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO.

Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |

The method depends on generating synthetic queries for documents using a language model (LM), and the key step is that we automatically optimize the LM prompt that is used to generate these queries based on training quality. In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Batch-Instructed Gradient for Prompt Evolution:Systematic Prompt Optimization for Enhanced Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08713v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images from user-provided prompts. Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[POS: A Prompts Optimization Suite for Augmenting Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00949v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper targets to enhance the diffusion-based text-to-video generation by improving the two input prompts, including the noise and the text. Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances.

| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuanWu/EASE-Prompt-Optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 1 figure, 23 tables</p></details> |

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Prompt Optimizer of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Abstract Concept Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11589v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of text-to-image diffusion models has opened the door of generative AI, enabling the translation of textual descriptions into visually compelling images with remarkable quality. However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p></details> | WWW 2024 Companion |

Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts. The reward function during training encourages the model to consider aesthetic score, semantic consistency, and user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively improves the original prompts, generating visually more appealing images while maintaining semantic alignment.

However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference. It demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot question-answering datasets: GSM8K, MultiArith, and AQuA.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Efficient Prompting Methods for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01077v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has become a mainstream paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific natural language processing tasks. While this approach opens the door to in-context learning of LLMs, it brings the additional computational burden of model inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.</p></details> |  |

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

Our work addresses the inherent limitations of conventional single-prompt learning methods that often lead to overfitting due to the inability to generalize across varying contexts in real-world videos. Recognizing the diversity of camera views, backgrounds, and objects in videos, we propose a multi-prompt learning framework enhanced with optimal transport. This design allows the model to learn a set of diverse prompts for each action, capturing general characteristics more effectively and distributing the representation to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, by employing optimal transport theory, we efficiently align these prompts with action features, optimizing for a comprehensive representation that adapts to the multifaceted nature of video data. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in action localization accuracy and robustness in few-shot settings on the standard challenging datasets of THUMOS-14 and EpicKitchens100, highlighting the efficacy of our multi-prompt optimal transport approach in overcoming the challenges of conventional few-shot TAL methods.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17804v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

One approach is to treat these models as black boxes and use forward passes (Inference APIs) to interact with them. Current research focuses on adapting these black-box models to downstream tasks using gradient-free prompt optimization, but this often involves an expensive process of searching task-specific prompts. Therefore, we are motivated to study black-box language model adaptation without prompt search. Specifically, we introduce a label-enhanced cross-attention network called CrossTune, which models the semantic relatedness between the input text sequence and task-specific label descriptions. Its effectiveness is examined in the context of few-shot text classification. To improve the generalization of CrossTune, we utilize ChatGPT to generate additional training data through in-context learning. A switch mechanism is implemented to exclude low-quality ChatGPT-generated data. Through extensive experiments on seven benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art gradient-free black-box tuning method by 5.7% on average. Even without using ChatGPT-augmented data, CrossTune performs better or comparably than previous black-box tuning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-Coling 2024</p></details> |

However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts.

Existing methods follow two main paradigms to collect evidence: (1) The \textit{retrieve-then-read} paradigm retrieves pertinent documents from an external corpus; and (2) the \textit{generate-then-read} paradigm employs large language models (LLMs) to generate relevant documents. However, neither can fully address multifaceted requirements for evidence. To this end, we propose LLMQA, a generalized framework that formulates the ODQA process into three basic steps: query expansion, document selection, and answer generation, combining the superiority of both retrieval-based and generation-based evidence. Since LLMs exhibit their excellent capabilities to accomplish various tasks, we instruct LLMs to play multiple roles as generators, rerankers, and evaluators within our framework, integrating them to collaborate in the ODQA process. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt optimization algorithm to refine role-playing prompts and steer LLMs to produce higher-quality evidence and answers. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks (NQ, WebQ, and TriviaQA) demonstrate that LLMQA achieves the best performance in terms of both answer accuracy and evidence quality, showcasing its potential for advancing ODQA research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>TheWe...</summary><p>TheWebConf 2024 (WWW 2024) oral, code repo: https://github.com/EthanLeo-LYX/LLMQA</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce ConstitutionalExperts, a method for learning a prompt consisting of constitutional principles (i.e. rules), given a training dataset. Unlike prior methods that optimize the prompt as a single entity, our method incrementally improves the prompt by surgically editing individual principles. We also show that we can improve overall performance by learning unique prompts for different semantic regions of the training data and using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to route inputs at inference time. We compare our method to other state of the art prompt-optimization techniques across six benchmark datasets. We also investigate whether MoE improves these other techniques. Our results suggest that ConstitutionalExperts outperforms other prompt optimization techniques by 10.9% (F1) and that mixture-of-experts improves all techniques, suggesting its broad applicability.</p></details> |  |

We identify a previously overlooked objective of query dependency in such optimization and elucidate two ensuing challenges that impede the successful and economical design of prompt optimization techniques. One primary issue is the absence of an effective method to evaluate prompts during inference when the golden answer is unavailable. Concurrently, learning via interactions with the LLMs to navigate the expansive natural language prompting space proves to be resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce Prompt-OIRL, which harnesses offline inverse reinforcement learning to draw insights from offline prompting demonstration data. Such data exists as by-products when diverse prompts are benchmarked on open-accessible datasets. With Prompt-OIRL, the query-dependent prompt optimization objective is achieved by first learning an offline reward model. This model can evaluate any query-prompt pairs without accessing LLMs. Subsequently, a best-of-N strategy is deployed to recommend the optimal prompt. Our experimental evaluations across various LLM scales and arithmetic reasoning datasets underscore both the efficacy and economic viability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02993v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating natural language has aroused a wide interest in developing prompt-based methods to harness the power of black-box LLMs. Existing methodologies usually prioritize a global optimization for finding the global optimum, which however will perform poorly in certain tasks. This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimization (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
