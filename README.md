| **[TAT: Temporal-Aligned Transformer for Multi-Horizon Peak Demand Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10349v1)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.10349v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-horizon time series forecasting has many practical applications such as demand forecasting. Accurate demand prediction is critical to help make buying and inventory decisions for supply chain management of e-commerce and physical retailers, and such predictions are typically required for future horizons extending tens of weeks. This is especially challenging during high-stake sales events when demand peaks are particularly difficult to predict accurately. However, these events are important not only for managing supply chain operations but also for ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers. To address this challenge, we propose Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT), a multi-horizon forecaster leveraging apriori-known context variables such as holiday and promotion events information for improving predictive performance. Our model consists of an encoder and decoder, both embedded with a novel Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA), designed to learn context-dependent alignment for peak demand forecasting. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on two large-scale proprietary datasets from a large e-commerce retailer. We demonstrate that TAT brings up to 30% accuracy improvement on peak demand forecasting while maintaining competitive overall performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables, published at KDD 2025 workshop on AI for Supply Chain: Today and Future</p></details> |
| **[MoCap-Impute: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Comparative Analysis of Imputation Methods for IMU-based Motion Capture Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10334v1)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.10334v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion capture (MoCap) data from wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) is vital for applications in sports science, but its utility is often compromised by missing data. Despite numerous imputation techniques, a systematic performance evaluation for IMU-derived MoCap time-series data is lacking. We address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods. Our evaluation considers three distinct contexts: univariate time-series, multivariate across subjects, and multivariate across kinematic angles. To facilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap dataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate practitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing completely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent pattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic variables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks consistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex missingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean absolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate techniques for transition point missingness. Advanced models like Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Iterative Imputers demonstrate the highest accuracy in these challenging scenarios. This work provides a critical baseline for future research and offers practical recommendations for improving the integrity and robustness of Mo-Cap data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 3 algorithms, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[TKAN: Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07344v4)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.07344v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have revolutionized many areas of machine learning, particularly in natural language and data sequence processing. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has demonstrated its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) a promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we proposed a new neural networks architecture inspired by KAN and the LSTM, the Temporal Kolomogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). TKANs combined the strenght of both networks, it is composed of Recurring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (RKANs) Layers embedding memory management. This innovation enables us to perform multi-step time series forecasting with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. By addressing the limitations of traditional models in handling complex sequential patterns, the TKAN architecture offers significant potential for advancements in fields requiring more than one step ahead forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet-Enhanced Neural ODE and Graph Attention for Interpretable Energy Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10132v1)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.10132v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply is critical for optimizing sustainable energy systems, yet it is challenged by the variability of renewable sources and dynamic consumption patterns. This paper introduces a neural framework that integrates continuous-time Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), graph attention, multi-resolution wavelet transformations, and adaptive learning of frequencies to address the issues of time series prediction. The model employs a robust ODE solver, using the Runge-Kutta method, paired with graph-based attention and residual connections to better understand both structural and temporal patterns. Through wavelet-based feature extraction and adaptive frequency modulation, it adeptly captures and models diverse, multi-scale temporal dynamics. When evaluated across seven diverse datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electricity transformer temperature), and Waste, Solar, and Hydro (renewable energy), this architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various forecasting metrics, proving its robustness in capturing complex temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the model enhances interpretability through SHAP analysis, making it suitable for sustainable energy applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusing Large Language Models with Temporal Transformers for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10098v1)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.10098v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vector-Quantized Foundation Model for Patient Behavior Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15221v2)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.15221v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their adoption in healthcare remains limited. While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of foundation models for patient behavior monitoring through personal digital devices remains underexplored. The data generated by these devices are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel foundation model based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder, specifically designed to process real-world data from smartphones and wearable devices. We leveraged the discrete latent representation of this model to effectively perform two downstream tasks, suicide risk assessment and emotional state prediction, on different held-out clinical cohorts without the need of fine-tuning. We also highlight the existence of a trade-off between discrete and continuous latent structures, suggesting that hybrid models may be optimal for balancing accuracy across various supervised and unsupervised tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (32 with references and supplementary material).

| **[Predicting Graph Structure via Adapted Flux Balance Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05806v2)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.05806v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps, which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended and revised version of arXiv:2401.04280</p></details> |
| **[Volume-Based Space-Time Cube for Large-Scale Continuous Spatial Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09917v1)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.09917v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial time series visualization offers scientific research pathways and analytical decision-making tools across various spatiotemporal domains. Despite many advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial information remains a challenge. The space-time cube (STC) stands out as a promising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal information, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal datasets. However, the STC is plagued by well-known issues such as visual occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with large-scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real-world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non-experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in largescale spatial time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuTSFlow: Modeling Continuous Functions Behind Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09888v1)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.09888v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as learning the transition from the historical function family to the future function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the transition path in function space from the historical function family to the future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead. Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Last Mile of Prediction: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Guided Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07192v2)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.07192v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility, while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM). CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model, enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Neural Networks and Dynamic Time Warping for Adaptive Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09826v1)** | 2025-07-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.09826v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in time series classification, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for training limits their applicability in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, they lack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast, dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is widely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent interpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and cannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a versatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with labeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic length-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while preserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the DTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on this, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a neural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available, while still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability. We apply the model to several benchmark time series classification tasks and observe that it significantly outperforms previous approaches in low-resource settings and remains competitive in rich-resource settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Time Series Autoregression for Periodicity Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22895v2)** | 2025-07-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.22895v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series autoregression (AR) is a classical tool for modeling auto-correlations and periodic structures in real-world systems. We revisit this model from an interpretable machine learning perspective by introducing sparse autoregression (SAR), where $\ell_0$-norm constraints are used to isolate dominant periodicities. We formulate exact mixed-integer optimization (MIO) approaches for both stationary and non-stationary settings and introduce two scalable extensions: a decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy for temporally-varying SAR (TV-SAR), and a two-stage optimization scheme for spatially- and temporally-varying SAR (STV-SAR). These models enable scalable inference on real-world spatiotemporal datasets. We validate our framework on large-scale mobility and climate time series. On NYC ridesharing data, TV-SAR reveals interpretable daily and weekly cycles as well as long-term shifts due to COVID-19. On climate datasets, STV-SAR uncovers the evolving spatial structure of temperature and precipitation seasonality across four decades in North America and detects global sea surface temperature dynamics, including El Ni\~no. Together, our results demonstrate the interpretability, flexibility, and scalability of sparse autoregression for periodicity quantification in complex time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Augmented Multimodal Clinical Rationale Generation for Disease Diagnosis with Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07611v5)** | 2025-07-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.07611v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretation is critical for disease diagnosis, but existing models struggle to balance predictive accuracy with human-understandable rationales. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable multimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in the same encoding space, enabling it to be naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.</p></details> | 13 pages. 7 figures |
| **[Evaluating the Role of Training Data Origin for Country-Scale Cropland Mapping in Data-Scarce Regions: A Case Study of Nigeria](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10872v2)** | 2025-07-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2312.10872v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cropland maps are essential for remote sensing-based agricultural monitoring, providing timely insights without extensive field surveys. Machine learning enables large-scale mapping but depends on geo-referenced ground-truth data, which is costly to collect, motivating the use of global datasets in data-scarce regions. A key challenge is understanding how the quantity, quality, and proximity of the training data to the target region influences model performance. We evaluate this in Nigeria, using 1,827 manually labelled samples covering the whole country, and subsets of the Geowiki dataset: Nigeria-only, regional (Nigeria and neighbouring countries), and global. We extract pixel-wise multi-source time series arrays from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ERA5 climate, and a digital elevation model using Google Earth Engine, comparing Random Forests with LSTMs, including a lightweight multi-headed LSTM variant. Results show local data significantly boosts performance, with accuracy gains up to 0.246 (RF) and 0.178 (LSTM). Nigeria-only or regional data outperformed global data despite the lower amount of labels, with the exception of the multi-headed LSTM, which benefited from global data when local samples were absent. Sentinel-1, climate, and topographic data are critical data sources, with their removal reducing F1-score by up to 0.593. Addressing class imbalance also improved LSTM accuracy by up to 0.071. Our top-performing model (Nigeria-only LSTM) achieved an F1-score of 0.814 and accuracy of 0.842, matching the best global land cover product while offering stronger recall, critical for food security. We release code, data, maps, and an interactive web app to support future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is published in ISPRS Open Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing under a CC BY 4.0 license: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667393225000109.

| **[Fourier Basis Mapping: A Time-Frequency Learning Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09445v1)** | 2025-07-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.09445v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear, MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking, centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09439v1)** | 2025-07-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.09439v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) is essential for effective decision-making in fields such as finance and marketing, where complex dependencies and lagged effects challenge conventional analytical approaches. We introduce Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in MTS (DyCAST-Net), a novel architecture designed to enhance causal discovery by integrating dilated temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. DyCAST-Net effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated convolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its attention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy and interpretability. A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens robustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference reliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets demonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation of causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in noisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights, uncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising on consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial markets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent mediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in high-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability across diverse application domains</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Discovery-Driven Change Point Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07290v2)** | 2025-07-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.07290v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change point detection in time series aims to identify moments when the probability distribution of time series changes. It is widely applied in many areas, such as human activity sensing and medical science. In the context of multivariate time series, this typically involves examining the joint distribution of multiple variables: If the distribution of any one variable changes, the entire time series undergoes a distribution shift. However, in practical applications, we may be interested only in certain components of the time series, exploring abrupt changes in their distributions while accounting for the presence of other components. Here, assuming an underlying structural causal model that governs the time-series data generation, we address this task by proposing a two-stage non-parametric algorithm that first learns parts of the causal structure through constraint-based discovery methods, and then employs conditional relative Pearson divergence estimation to identify the change points. The conditional relative Pearson divergence quantifies the distribution difference between consecutive segments in the time series, while the causal discovery method allows a focus on the causal mechanism, facilitating access to independent and identically distributed (IID) samples. Theoretically, the typical assumption of samples being IID in conventional change point detection methods can be relaxed based on the Causal Markov Condition. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the correctness and utility of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2025, Mai Khao, Thailand.

Detecting fraudulent transactions is critical for payment gateway companies like Flow Payment, which process millions of transactions monthly and require robust security measures to mitigate financial risks. Increasing transaction authorization rates while reducing fraud is essential for providing a good user experience and building a sustainable business. For this reason, discovering novel and improved methods to detect fraud requires continuous research and investment for any company that wants to succeed in this industry. In this work, we introduced a novel method for detecting transactional fraud by incorporating the Relative Distance Rotating Encoding (ReDRE) in the RoFormer model. The incorporation of angle rotation using ReDRE enhances the characterization of time series data within a Transformer, leading to improved fraud detection by better capturing temporal dependencies and event relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI)</p></details> |

Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation. By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating uncertainty into time series imputation.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges in constructing accurate wavelet bases and high computational costs limit their application. This study introduces a constructive WNN that selects initial bases and trains functions by introducing new bases for predefined accuracy while reducing computational costs. For the first time, we analyze the frequency of unknown nonlinear functions and select appropriate initial wavelets based on their primary frequency components by estimating the energy of the spatial frequency component. This leads to a novel constructive framework consisting of a frequency estimator and a wavelet-basis increase mechanism to prioritize high-energy bases, significantly improving computational efficiency. The theoretical foundation defines the necessary time-frequency range for high-dimensional wavelets at a given accuracy. The framework's versatility is demonstrated through four examples: estimating unknown static mappings from offline data, combining two offline datasets, identifying time-varying mappings from time-series data, and capturing nonlinear dependencies in real time-series data. These examples showcase the framework's broad applicability and practicality. All the code will be released at https://github.com/dshuangdd/CWNN.</p></details> | 17pages |

In clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end, DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33% time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark.

However, these systems face significant computational challenges that limit scalability and efficiency. Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems. Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN) design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system. Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T1 and T2 of the IBM Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on superconducting hardware.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

However, their reliance on fixed nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC - limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation frequency.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

For example, brain activity, which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures, a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths, to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and can be used to compute the lead matrix, which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto Stochastic Block Model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. We also explored the performance of our community detection on a stochastic variant of the KSBM as well as on real neuropixels of cortical recordings to demonstrate applicability on real-world data. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p></details> | 56 pages, 21 figures |

This physical prior often takes the form of a partial differential equation (PDE) system that the regression function must satisfy.

In particular, we study the properties of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in terms of approximation, consistency, overfitting, and convergence. We then show how PIML problems can be framed as kernel methods, making it possible to apply the tools of kernel ridge regression to better understand their behavior. In addition, we use this kernel formulation to develop novel physics-informed algorithms and implement them efficiently on GPUs. The second part explores industrial applications in forecasting energy signals during atypical periods. We present results from the Smarter Mobility challenge on electric vehicle charging occupancy and examine the impact of mobility on electricity demand.

However, the inherent time variance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address non-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is developed that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting tasks.Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

By replacing the fixed linear autoregressive component with a spline-based basis expansion, Galerkin-ARIMA flexibly approximates the underlying relationship among past values via ordinary least squares, while retaining the moving-average structure and Gaussian innovation assumptions of ARIMA. We derive closed-form solutions for both the AR and MA components using two-stage Galerkin projections, establish conditions for asymptotic unbiasedness and consistency, and analyze the bias-variance trade-off under basis-size growth. Complexity analysis reveals that, for moderate basis dimensions, our approach can substantially reduce computational cost compared to maximum-likelihood ARIMA estimation. Through extensive simulations on four synthetic processes-including noisy ARMA, seasonal, trend-AR, and nonlinear recursion series-we demonstrate that Galerkin-ARIMA matches or closely approximates ARIMA's forecasting accuracy while achieving orders-of-magnitude speedups in rolling forecasting tasks. These results suggest that Galerkin-ARIMA offers a powerful, efficient alternative for modeling complex time series dynamics in high-volume or real-time applications.</p></details> |  |

Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is challenging due to the algorithm's complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications.

The S-DEIM estimate involves a kernel vector whose optimal value is inferred through a data assimilation algorithm. This data assimilation step suffers from two drawbacks: (i) It requires the knowledge of the governing equations of the dynamical system, and (ii) It is not generally guaranteed to converge to the optimal kernel vector. To address these issues, here we introduce an equation-free S-DEIM framework that estimates the optimal kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We show that the recurrent architecture is necessary since the kernel vector cannot be estimated from instantaneous observations. But RNNs, which incorporate the past history of the observations in the learning process, lead to nearly optimal estimations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on three numerical examples with increasing degree of spatiotemporal complexity: a conceptual model of atmospheric flow known as the Lorenz-96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Rayleigh-Benard convection. In each case, the resulting S-DEIM estimates are satisfactory even when a relatively simple RNN architecture, namely the reservoir computing network, is used.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.</p></details> | 46 pages, 9 figures |

When ML methods are responsible for making critical decisions, stakeholders often require insights into how to alter these decisions. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) have emerged as a solution, offering interpretations of opaque ML models and providing a pathway to transition from one decision to another. However, most existing CFE methods require access to the model's training dataset, few methods can handle multivariate time-series, and none of model-agnostic CFE methods can handle multivariate time-series without training datasets. These limitations can be formidable in many scenarios. In this paper, we present NTD-CFE, a novel model-agnostic CFE method based on reinforcement learning (RL) that generates CFEs when training datasets are unavailable. NTD-CFE is suitable for both static and multivariate time-series datasets with continuous and discrete features. NTD-CFE reduces the CFE search space from a multivariate time-series domain to a lower dimensional space and addresses the problem using RL. Users have the flexibility to specify non-actionable, immutable, and preferred features, as well as causal constraints. We demonstrate the performance of NTD-CFE against four baselines on several datasets and find that, despite not having access to a training dataset, NTD-CFE finds CFEs that make significantly fewer and significantly smaller changes to the input time-series. These properties make CFEs more actionable, as the magnitude of change required to alter an outcome is vastly reduced.

In the context of Learning by Demonstration (LbD), classifying and segmenting complex motions into primitive actions, such as pushing, pulling, twisting etc, is considered to be a key-step towards encoding a task. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to undertake this task, considering a finite set of predefined primitive actions found in fruit picking operations.

While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling. In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER. This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in mainstream datasets within this domain.

The demand for real-time AD has surged with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach. Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time, high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

While saliency methods promise visual validation of predictions for image and language processing, they fall short when applied to time series. These tend to be less intuitive and represent highly diverse data, such as the tool-use time series dataset. Furthermore, saliency methods often generate varied, conflicting explanations, complicating the reliability of these methods. Consequently, a rigorous objective assessment is necessary to establish trust in them. This paper investigates saliency methods on time series data to formulate recommendations for interpreting convolutional models and implements them on the tool-use time series problem. To achieve this, we first employ nine gradient-, propagation-, or perturbation-based post-hoc saliency methods across six varied and complex real-world datasets. Next, we evaluate these methods using five independent metrics to generate recommendations. Subsequently, we implement a case study focusing on tool-use time series using convolutional classification models. Our results validate our recommendations that indicate that none of the saliency methods consistently outperforms others on all metrics, while some are sometimes ahead.

Specifically, we explore the setting where the modality used in testing has no labeled data during training, which we refer to as Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA). We categorize existing UMA approaches as Student-Teacher or Contrastive Alignment methods. These methods typically compress continuous-time data samples into single latent vectors during alignment, inhibiting their ability to transfer temporal information through real-world temporal distortions. To address this, we introduce Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T), which preserves temporal information during alignment to handle dynamic sensor data better. C3T achieves this by aligning a set of temporal latent vectors across sensing modalities. Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets demonstrate that C3T outperforms existing methods in UMA by at least 8% in accuracy and shows superior robustness to temporal distortions such as time-shift, misalignment, and dilation. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for various multimodal applications.</p></details> |  |

As the field moves toward multi-modality, Large Vision Models (LVMs) are emerging as a promising direction. In the past, the effectiveness of Transformer and LLMs in time series has been debated. When it comes to LVMs, a similar question arises: are LVMs truely useful for time series analysis? To address it, we design and conduct the first principled study involving 4 LVMs, 8 imaging methods, 18 datasets and 26 baselines across both high-level (classification) and low-level (forecasting) tasks, with extensive ablation analysis. Our findings indicate LVMs are indeed useful for time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. Although effective, the contemporary best LVM forecasters are limited to specific types of LVMs and imaging methods, exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods, and have limited ability to utilize long look-back windows. We hope our findings could serve as a cornerstone for future research on LVM- and multimodal-based solutions to different time series tasks.</p></details> |  |

Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution through pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task-specific adaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos) across three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes, EUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM exhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version of TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained version achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and 15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's zero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting and equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can surpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model consistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable performance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant sample-efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines, traditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of three tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task-specific optimisation. These findings indicate that TSFMs, though still nascent, offer substantial promise for financial forecasting-particularly in noisy, data-constrained tasks-but achieving competitive performance likely requires domain-specific pretraining and architectural refinements tailored to financial time series characteristics.</p></details> | 66 pages |

Unlike previous EHR synthesis methods, which typically generate medical records consisting of expert-chosen features (e.g. a few vital signs or structured codes only), we introduce RawMed, the first framework to synthesize multi-table, time-series EHR data that closely resembles raw EHRs. Using text-based representation and compression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal dynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework for multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional similarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy. Validated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models in fidelity and utility. The code is available at https://github.com/eunbyeol-cho/RawMed.</p></details> |  |

To asses it, we evaluated ten base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger, accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance, achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective forecasts suitable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This study compares the performance of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with traditional methods, including statistical models and gradient boosting, within a conformal prediction setting. Our findings highlight two key advantages of TSFMs. First, when the volume of data is limited, TSFMs provide more reliable conformalized prediction intervals than classic models, thanks to their superior predictive accuracy. Second, the calibration process is more stable because more data are used for calibration. Morever, the fewer data available, the more pronounced these benefits become, as classic models require a substantial amount of data for effective training. These results underscore the potential of foundation models in improving conformal prediction reliability in time series applications, particularly in data-constrained cases. All the code to reproduce the experiments is available.</p></details> |  |

I identify when politicians mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations. This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming power.</p></details> |  |

The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free, with the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical long-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature records, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular, sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the dominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant coherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient, interpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We hope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques will provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling reduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework for predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.</p></details> | 8 pages |

With the remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), the adoption of LLMs as the foundational architecture for time series modeling has gained significant attention. Although existing models achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency characteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal performance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling periodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an innovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency domain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the pretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively transfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets with different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency and time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing mechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input signals. In experiments on six public benchmarks, MoFE-Time has achieved new state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE and MAE by 6.95% and 6.02% compared to the representative methods Time-MoE. Beyond the existing evaluation benchmarks, we have developed a proprietary dataset, NEV-sales, derived from real-world business scenarios. Our method achieves outstanding results on this dataset, underscoring the effectiveness of the MoFE-Time model in practical commercial applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we establish a rigorous relation between MoE and the self-attention mechanism, showing that each row of a self-attention matrix can be written as a quadratic gating mixture of linear experts. Motivated by this connection, we conduct a comprehensive convergence analysis of MoE models with two different quadratic gating functions, namely the quadratic polynomial gate and the quadratic monomial gate, offering useful insights into the design of gating and experts for the MoE framework. First, our analysis indicates that the use of the quadratic monomial gate yields an improved sample efficiency for estimating parameters and experts compared to the quadratic polynomial gate. Second, parameter and expert estimation rates become significantly faster when employing non-linear experts in place of linear experts. Combining these theoretical insights with the above link between MoE and self-attention, we propose a novel \emph{active-attention} mechanism where we apply a non-linear activation function to the value matrix in the formula of self-attention. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed active-attention outperforms the standard self-attention through several extensive experiments in various tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and multivariate time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pedra...</summary><p>Pedram Akbarian, Huy Nguyen, and Xing Han made equal contributions to this work</p></details> |

Traditional methods often prove inadequate, causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm (GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE: 87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies, enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall, the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.</p></details> |  |

The study of such properties on dependent data is still a challenge. In this paper, we carry out deep learning from strongly mixing observations, and deal with the squared and a broad class of loss functions. We consider sparse-penalized regularization for deep neural network predictor. For a general framework that includes, regression estimation, classification, time series prediction,$\cdots$, oracle inequality for the expected excess risk is established and a bound on the class of H\"older smooth functions is provided. For nonparametric regression from strong mixing data and sub-exponentially error, we provide an oracle inequality for the $L_2$ error and investigate an upper bound of this error on a class of H\"older composition functions. For the specific case of nonparametric autoregression with Gaussian and Laplace errors, a lower bound of the $L_2$ error on this H\"older composition class is established. Up to logarithmic factor, this bound matches its upper bound; so, the deep neural network estimator attains the minimax optimal rate.</p></details> |  |

Time series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages: input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction, and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules, such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks, including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter count.

Most TSAD methods driven by forecasting models tend to overfit by emphasizing minor fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that effective TSAD should focus on modeling "normal" behavior through smooth local patterns. To achieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series with smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate function ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local disturbances. However, a direct KAN implementation proves susceptible to these disturbances due to the inherently localized characteristics of B-spline functions. We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier expansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that emphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four popular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in detection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines. Remarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a 50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the approach's efficiency and practical viability.</p></details> | 11 pages, ICML 2025 |

This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> |

TCP integrates quantile regression with a conformal calibration layer that adapts online via a decaying learning rate. This hybrid design bridges statistical and machine learning paradigms, enabling TCP to accommodate non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and regime shifts which are hallmarks of real-world asset returns, without relying on rigid parametric assumptions. We benchmark TCP against established methods including GARCH, Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across equities (S&P 500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Empirical results show that TCP consistently delivers sharper intervals with competitive or superior coverage, particularly in high-volatility regimes. Our study underscores TCP's strength in navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff, a central challenge in modern risk forecasting.

This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning. Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes.

In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM)- a novel class of SSMs that leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at finite precision, enabling SSMs to model a broad class of regular languages that are out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training. Empirically, we show that AUSSM when interleaved with Mamba outperform prior SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence modeling.</p></details> |  |

Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics. The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the version of the paper presented at ICCSM 2025 (July 2025 in Rome, Italy).

The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, volume 279, 2025, DOI: 10.3847/1538-4365/addc73</p></details> |

While Deep Learning (DL) methods have demonstrated strong forecasting capabilities, their adoption in industrial CPS remains limited due insufficient robustness. Existing robustness evaluations primarily focus on formal verification or adversarial perturbations, inadequately representing the complexities encountered in real-world CPS scenarios. To address this, we introduce a practical robustness definition grounded in distributional robustness, explicitly tailored to industrial CPS, and propose a systematic framework for robustness evaluation. Our framework simulates realistic disturbances, such as sensor drift, noise and irregular sampling, enabling thorough robustness analyses of forecasting models on real-world CPS datasets. The robustness definition provides a standardized score to quantify and compare model performance across diverse datasets, assisting in informed model selection and architecture design. Through extensive empirical studies evaluating prominent DL architectures (including recurrent, convolutional, attention-based, modular, and structured state-space models) we demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

The Lyapunov exponent is a key measure of chaotic behavior, but its accurate estimation from experimental data is often hindered by methodological and computational limitations. In this work, we present a novel machine-learning-based approach for estimating the positive Lyapunov exponent (MLE) from one-dimensional time series, using the growth of out-of-sample prediction errors as a proxy for trajectory divergence. Our method demonstrates high scientific relevance, offering a robust, data-driven alternative to traditional analytic techniques. Through comprehensive testing on several canonical chaotic maps - including the logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev maps - we achieved a coefficient of determination R2pos > 0.9 between predicted and theoretical MLE values for time series as short as M = 200 points. The best accuracy was observed for the Chebyshev map (R2pos = 0.999).

A new procedure is introduced which exploits structured time series of both qualitative and quantitative data by means of a transformer neural network. The first step of this procedure aims at learning representations of time series through contrastive learning (without any labels). The second step leverages these representations to generate a money laundering scoring of all observations. A two-thresholds approach is then introduced, which ensures a controlled false-positive rate by means of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure. Experiments confirm that the transformer is able to produce general representations that succeed in exploiting money laundering patterns with minimal supervision from domain experts. It also illustrates the higher ability of the new procedure for detecting nonfraudsters as well as fraudsters, while keeping the false positive rate under control. This greatly contrasts with rule-based procedures or the ones based on LSTM architectures.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to incorporating external factors, we propose to learn the processes underlying cellular load generation by employing population dynamics data. In this study, we focus on smart roads and use road traffic measures to improve prediction accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that by employing road flow and speed, in addition to cellular network metrics, base station load prediction errors can be substantially reduced, by as much as $56.5\%.$ The code, visualizations and extensive results are available on https://github.com/nvassileva/DataMatters.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns. However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |

However, most applications still rely on a single backend model, limiting coverage of capabilities and leading to inefficiencies in performance and token cost when tackling complex tasks. We highlight an underexploited opportunity: LLM routing data, produced when hosting platforms route diverse queries to different models, which can reveal comparative strengths across tasks. To address this, we propose FusionBench, a comprehensive routing benchmark covering 14 tasks across five domains with 20 open-source LLMs (8B to 671B parameters), capturing 103M tokens and summarizing reusable thought templates from top models. Building on this, we introduce FusionFactory, a systematic fusion framework with three levels: (1) query-level fusion, tailoring routers for each query using both direct responses and reasoning-augmented outputs; (2) thought-level fusion, leveraging abstract templates derived from top-performing LLMs' answers to similar queries; and (3) model-level fusion, transferring capabilities between models via distillation, using top responses or highest judge scores as training data. Experiments show FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best individual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with optimal fusion configurations varying by benchmark, demonstrating the value of systematic LLM fusion in harnessing complementary strengths and improving overall performance.</p></details> |  |

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking. However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved judge performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/mattymchen/codejudgebench</p></details> |

We present a new corpus that combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications -- into a single common format providing the necessary information to experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase question frequency and relevancy.</p></details> |  |

Recently, there has been increasing interest in leveraging advanced technologies to assist parents in co-regulating emotions with their children. However, limited research has explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with SAR to facilitate emotion co-regulation between parents and children with neurodevelopmental disorders. To address this gap, we developed an LLM-powered social robot by deploying a speech communication module on the MiRo-E robotic platform. This supervised autonomous system integrates LLM prompts and robotic behaviors to deliver tailored interventions for both parents and neurodivergent children. Pilot tests were conducted with two parent-child dyads, followed by a qualitative analysis. The findings reveal MiRo-E's positive impacts on interaction dynamics and its potential to facilitate emotion regulation, along with identified design and technical challenges. Based on these insights, we provide design implications to advance the future development of LLM-powered SAR for mental health applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission for the IROS 2025 conference</p></details> |

Instead, assembling heterogeneous clusters by pooling together GPUs of different generations allows them to achieve higher aggregate compute and make use of all available GPUs. However, training on heterogeneous clusters presents several challenges, including load balancing across GPUs, optimizing memory usage to accommodate varying memory capacities, and ensuring communication-efficient training over diverse network interconnects potentially spanning multiple datacenters. In this paper, we make the case that efficient training on heterogeneous clusters requires (1) the integration of pipeline parallelism and data parallelism in a manner that is both communication- and memory-efficient, and (2) a more adaptable configuration of pipeline and data parallelism, which includes the capability to flexibly partition GPUs into asymmetric pipeline parallel stages and to incorporate heterogeneous GPUs within the same data parallelism group. We propose Zorse, the first system to unify all these capabilities while incorporating a planner that automatically configures training strategies for a given workload. Our evaluation shows that Zorse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems in heterogeneous training scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, they remain vulnerable to evasion techniques. We demonstrate two approaches for bypassing LLM prompt injection and jailbreak detection systems via traditional character injection methods and algorithmic Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) evasion techniques. Through testing against six prominent protection systems, including Microsoft's Azure Prompt Shield and Meta's Prompt Guard, we show that both methods can be used to evade detection while maintaining adversarial utility achieving in some instances up to 100% evasion success. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversaries can enhance Attack Success Rates (ASR) against black-box targets by leveraging word importance ranking computed by offline white-box models. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities within current LLM protection mechanisms and highlight the need for more robust guardrail systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables.

Cloud-based traffic simulation solutions have flourished, offering increasingly realistic representations of the evolving mobility landscape. LLMs have emerged as pioneering tools, providing robust support for various applications, including intelligent decision-making, user interaction, and real-time traffic analysis. As user demand for e-mobility continues to grow, delivering comprehensive end-to-end solutions has become crucial. In this paper, we present a cloud-based, LLM-powered shared e-mobility platform, integrated with a mobile application for personalized route recommendations. The optimization module is evaluated based on travel time and cost across different traffic scenarios. Additionally, the LLM-powered RAG framework is evaluated at the schema level for different users, using various evaluation methods. Schema-level RAG with XiYanSQL achieves an average execution accuracy of 0.81 on system operator queries and 0.98 on user queries.</p></details> |  |

This is crucial as many real-world applications, ranging from personalized recommendations to healthcare interventions, demand that LLMs not only predict but also actively learn to make optimal decisions through exploration. In this work, we measure LLMs' (in)ability to make optimal decisions in bandits, a state-less reinforcement learning setting relevant to many applications. We develop a comprehensive suite of environments, including both context-free and contextual bandits with varying task difficulties, to benchmark LLMs' performance. Motivated by the existence of optimal exploration algorithms, we propose efficient ways to integrate this algorithmic knowledge into LLMs: by providing explicit algorithm-guided support during inference; and through algorithm distillation via in-context demonstrations and fine-tuning, using synthetic data generated from these algorithms. Impressively, these techniques allow us to achieve superior exploration performance with smaller models, surpassing larger models on various tasks. We conducted an extensive ablation study to shed light on various factors, such as task difficulty and data representation, that influence the efficiency of LLM exploration. Additionally, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the LLM's exploration efficiency using the concept of regret, linking its ability to explore to the model size and underlying algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages.

It distributes the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose \textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.28$\times$-1.79$\times$ compared to baselines.

This survey focuses on LLM-based Table Agents, which aim to automate table-centric workflows by integrating preprocessing, reasoning, and domain adaptation. We define five core competencies--C1: Table Structure Understanding, C2: Table and Query Semantic Understanding, C3: Table Retrieval and Compression, C4: Executable Reasoning with Traceability, and C5: Cross-Domain Generalization--to analyze and compare current approaches. In addition, a detailed examination of the Text-to-SQL Agent reveals a performance gap between academic benchmarks and real-world scenarios, especially for open-source models. Finally, we provide actionable insights to improve the robustness, generalization, and efficiency of LLM-based Table Agents in practical settings.</p></details> |  |

Our results show that this approach - relying solely on textual information - achieves competitive performance: while it does not outperform state-of-the-art speech LLMs fine-tuned for the task, it surpasses a BERT-based model trained specifically for this purpose. NLA proves particularly effective in mismatched task settings, is generalisable to other data types and languages, and offers greater interpretability, as it is grounded in clearly explainable, widely applicable language descriptors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 10th Workshop on Speech and Language Technology in Education (SLaTE 2025)</p></details> |

In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.</p></details> |  |

Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional feature KD methods typically assume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting the flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this problem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but this introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and often degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative settings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based feature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and student models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any new parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components contribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their activations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with other distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements over prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification, instruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\% performance gain over the linear projection baseline.</p></details> |  |

To reduce deployment costs, continuous batching has become an essential feature in current service frameworks. The effectiveness of continuous batching relies on an accurate estimate of the memory requirements of requests. However, due to the diversity in request output lengths, existing frameworks tend to adopt aggressive or conservative schedulers, which often result in significant overestimation or underestimation of memory consumption. Consequently, they suffer from harmful request evictions or prolonged queuing times, failing to achieve satisfactory throughput under strict Service Level Agreement (SLA) guarantees (a.k.a. goodput), across various LLM application scenarios with differing input-output length distributions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Past-Future scheduler that precisely estimates the peak memory resources required by the running batch via considering the historical distribution of request output lengths and calculating memory occupancy at each future time point. It adapts to applications with all types of input-output length distributions, balancing the trade-off between request queuing and harmful evictions, thereby consistently achieving better goodput. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduler, we developed a high-performance LLM serving framework, LightLLM, that implements the Past-Future scheduler. Compared to existing aggressive or conservative schedulers, LightLLM demonstrates superior goodput, achieving up to 2-3$\times$ higher goodput than other schedulers under heavy loads. LightLLM is open source to boost the research in such direction (https://github.com/ModelTC/lightllm).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASPLOS 2025</p></details> |

In UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, joint optimization of sensor transmission scheduling and velocity is critical for minimizing Age of Information (AoI) from stale sensor data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been used for such optimization; however, its limitations such as low sampling efficiency, simulation-to-reality gaps, and complex training render it unsuitable for time-critical applications like wildfire monitoring. This paper introduces a new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the UAV's flight control and data collection schedule along the trajectory in real time, thereby asymptotically minimizing the average AoI across ground sensors. In contrast to DRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and controls velocity using natural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling dynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Because they are still in development, what is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies for debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge into awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if prompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show promise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?" Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases, contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their initial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and users interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. "Could you be wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent metacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive prompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based improvements to human decision making.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in reformatting clinical text, their high computational requirements, lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns hinder practical deployment. To address these challenges, we explore lightweight encoder-decoder models (<300M parameters)-specifically T5 and BERT2BERT-for structuring radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus datasets. We benchmark these models against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B), adapted using prefix prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) finetuning. Our best-performing lightweight model outperforms all LLMs adapted using prompt-based techniques on a human-annotated test set. While some LoRA-finetuned LLMs achieve modest gains over the lightweight model on the Findings section (BLEU 6.4%, ROUGE-L 4.8%, BERTScore 3.6%, F1-RadGraph 1.1%, GREEN 3.6%, and F1-SRR-BERT 4.3%), these improvements come at the cost of substantially greater computational resources. For example, LLaMA-3-70B incurred more than 400 times the inference time, cost, and carbon emissions compared to the lightweight model. These results underscore the potential of lightweight, task-specific models as sustainable and privacy-preserving solutions for structuring clinical text in resource-constrained healthcare settings.</p></details> |  |

However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we propose Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).</p></details> |  |

While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities or adversarial prompting techniques, this study examines a more direct threat scenario: open-source LLMs generating vulnerable code when prompted either directly or indirectly. We propose a dual experimental design: (1) Dynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user persona, and directness across structured templates; and (2) Reverse Prompting, which derives prompts from real vulnerable code samples to assess vulnerability reproduction accuracy. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral, and Gemma) using ESBMC static analysis to assess both the presence of vulnerabilities and the correctness of the generated vulnerability type. Results show all models frequently produce vulnerable outputs, with Qwen2 achieving highest correctness rates. User persona significantly affects success, where student personas achieved higher vulnerability rates than professional roles, while direct prompts were marginally more effective. Vulnerability reproduction followed an inverted-U pattern with cyclomatic complexity, peaking at moderate ranges. Our findings expose limitations of safety mechanisms in open-source models, particularly for seemingly benign educational requests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |

This increases the risk of misuse and highlights the need for reliable detectors. Yet, existing detectors exhibit poor robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and attacked data, which is critical for real-world scenarios. Also, they struggle to provide interpretable evidence to support their decisions, thus undermining the reliability. In light of these challenges, we propose IPAD (Inverse Prompt for AI Detection), a novel framework consisting of a Prompt Inverter that identifies predicted prompts that could have generated the input text, and two Distinguishers that examine the probability that the input texts align with the predicted prompts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that IPAD outperforms the strongest baselines by 9.05% (Average Recall) on in-distribution data, 12.93% (AUROC) on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and 5.48% (AUROC) on attacked data. IPAD also performs robustly on structured datasets. Furthermore, an interpretability assessment is conducted to illustrate that IPAD enhances the AI detection trustworthiness by allowing users to directly examine the decision-making evidence, which provides interpretable support for its state-of-the-art detection results.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities to enhance the design study process, providing capabilities such as creative problem-solving, data handling, and insightful analysis. However, despite their growing popularity, there remains a lack of systematic understanding of how LLMs can effectively assist researchers in visualization-specific design studies. In this paper, we conducted a multi-stage qualitative study to fill this gap, involving 30 design study researchers from diverse backgrounds and expertise levels. Through in-depth interviews and carefully-designed questionnaires, we investigated strategies for utilizing LLMs, the challenges encountered, and the practices used to overcome them. We further compiled and summarized the roles that LLMs can play across different stages of the design study process. Our findings highlight practical implications to inform visualization practitioners, and provide a framework for leveraging LLMs to enhance the design study process in visualization research.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases, resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17 benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.</p></details> |  |

Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

While significant progress has been made in developing taxonomies for LLM risks and safety evaluation prompts, most studies have focused on monolingual contexts, primarily in English. However, language- and region-specific risks in bilingual contexts are often overlooked, and core findings can diverge from those in monolingual settings. In this paper, we introduce Qorgau, a novel dataset specifically designed for safety evaluation in Kazakh and Russian, reflecting the unique bilingual context in Kazakhstan, where both Kazakh (a low-resource language) and Russian (a high-resource language) are spoken. Experiments with both multilingual and language-specific LLMs reveal notable differences in safety performance, emphasizing the need for tailored, region-specific datasets to ensure the responsible and safe deployment of LLMs in countries like Kazakhstan.

Caching techniques, which leverage data reuse to reduce computation, offer opportunities to optimize the performance of LLM inference engines. On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the token level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request volume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full instruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role. However, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it rare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting challenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this challenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving systems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the representation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of spatial locality. Such spatial locality enables us to predict potential instructions located in a compact region in the space, resulting in an effective caching system at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that InstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate compared to the upper bound of traditional caching mechanisms on WildChat dataset and reduces the time per output token of vLLM by up to 42.0% and 50.0% on LMSys and Moss datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

While recent Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) methods iteratively refine prompts using model-generated feedback, textual gradients, they primarily focus on error correction and neglect valuable insights from correct predictions. This limits both their effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel APO framework centered on enhancing the feedback mechanism. We reinterpret the textual gradient as a form of negative reinforcement and introduce the complementary positive reinforcement to explicitly preserve beneficial prompt components identified through successful predictions. To mitigate the noise inherent in LLM-generated feedback, we introduce a technique called feedback diversification, which aggregates multiple feedback signals, emphasizing consistent, actionable advice while filtering out outliers. Motivated by the rapid evolution and diversity of available LLMs, we also formalize Continual Prompt Optimization (CPO), addressing the practical challenge of efficiently migrating optimized prompts between different model versions or API providers. Our experiments reveal that naive prompt migration often degrades performance due to loss of critical instructions. In contrast, our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significant accuracy improvements, faster convergence, and lower computational costs in both standard and migration scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a growing need to evaluate safety at the application level, as components such as system prompts, retrieval pipelines, and guardrails introduce additional factors that significantly influence the overall safety of LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce a practical framework for evaluating application-level safety in LLM systems, validated through real-world deployment across multiple use cases within our organization. The framework consists of two parts: (1) principles for developing customized safety risk taxonomies, and (2) practices for evaluating safety risks in LLM applications. We illustrate how the proposed framework was applied in our internal pilot, providing a reference point for organizations seeking to scale their safety testing efforts. This work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts in AI safety and the operational realities of safeguarding LLM applications in practice, offering actionable guidance for safe and scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |

On the one hand, making informed decisions is challenging and requires domain expertise in options and their combinations. On the other hand, machine learning techniques can search vast configuration spaces, but with a high computational cost, since concrete executions of numerous configurations are required. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can assist in performance-oriented software configuration through prompts. We evaluate several LLMs on tasks including identifying relevant options, ranking configurations, and recommending performant configurations across various configurable systems, such as compilers, video encoders, and SAT solvers. Our preliminary results reveal both positive abilities and notable limitations: depending on the task and systems, LLMs can well align with expert knowledge, whereas hallucinations or superficial reasoning can emerge in other cases. These findings represent a first step toward systematic evaluations and the design of LLM-based solutions to assist with software configuration.</p></details> |  |

LLM-powered Multiagent Systems (MAS) have thus emerged, both for assistive and simulation purposes, yet tools for realistic human behavior simulation -- with its distinctive challenges and opportunities -- remain underdeveloped. Existing MAS libraries and tools lack fine-grained persona specifications, population sampling facilities, experimentation support, and integrated validation, among other key capabilities, limiting their utility for behavioral studies, social simulation, and related applications. To address these deficiencies, in this work we introduce TinyTroupe, a simulation toolkit enabling detailed persona definitions (e.g., nationality, age, occupation, personality, beliefs, behaviors) and programmatic control via numerous LLM-driven mechanisms. This allows for the concise formulation of behavioral problems of practical interest, either at the individual or group level, and provides effective means for their solution. TinyTroupe's components are presented using representative working examples, such as brainstorming and market research sessions, thereby simultaneously clarifying their purpose and demonstrating their usefulness. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of selected aspects are also provided, highlighting possibilities, limitations, and trade-offs. The approach, though realized as a specific Python implementation, is meant as a novel conceptual contribution, which can be partially or fully incorporated in other contexts.

Existing strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces a new framework that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose \acronym, a framework that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. To further increase the efficiency of verification, the edge server batch the diverse verification requests from devices. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by sharing the same upstream target model across multiple devices. Our initial experiments with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4B/5, and an edge server equipped with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs indicate substantial benefits: 2.2 more system throughput, 2.8 more system capacity, and better cost efficiency, all without sacrificing model accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

A larger target model then reviews this draft to align with its output, and any acceptance by the target model results in a reduction of the number of the target model runs, ultimately improving efficiency. However, the drafting process in speculative decoding includes slow autoregressive generation and allocates equal time to generating tokens, irrespective of their importance. These inefficiencies collectively contribute to the suboptimal performance of speculative decoding. To further improve LLM inference, we introduce Cascade Speculative Drafting (CS Drafting), a speculative execution algorithm that incorporates two types of cascades. The Vertical Cascade eliminates autoregressive generation from neural models, while the Horizontal Cascade optimizes time allocation in drafting for improved efficiency. Combining both cascades, CS Drafting achieves greater speedup compared to the baselines in our experiments, while preserving the same output distribution as the target model.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

We propose MCEval, a novel multilingual evaluation framework that employs dynamic cultural question construction and enables causal analysis through Counterfactual Rephrasing and Confounder Rephrasing. Our comprehensive evaluation spans 13 cultures and 13 languages, systematically assessing both cultural awareness and cultural bias across different linguistic scenarios. The framework provides 39,897 cultural awareness instances and 17,940 cultural bias instances. Experimental results reveal performance disparities across different linguistic scenarios, demonstrating that optimal cultural performance is not only linked to training data distribution, but also is related to language-culture alignment. The evaluation results also expose the fairness issue, where approaches appearing successful in the English scenario create substantial disadvantages. MCEval represents the first comprehensive multilingual cultural evaluation framework that provides deeper insights into LLMs' cultural understanding.</p></details> |  |

We tested three personality traits distributions (positive, mixed, and negative) and found that positive traits correlate with higher happiness and stronger friendships. Temperature preferences, assertiveness, and selflessness have a significant impact on happiness and decisions.

In the recent LLM era, research has been conducted to automate document relevance labels, as these labels have traditionally been assigned by crowd-sourced workers - a process that is both time and consuming and costly. This study focuses on LLM-generated usefulness labels, a crucial evaluation metric that considers the user's search intents and task objectives, an aspect where relevance falls short. Our experiment utilizes task-level, query-level, and document-level features along with user search behavior signals, which are essential in defining the usefulness of a document. Our research finds that (i) pre-trained LLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by understanding the comprehensive search task session, (ii) pre-trained LLMs perform better judgement in short search sessions when provided with search session contexts. Additionally, we investigated whether LLMs can capture the unique divergence between relevance and usefulness, along with conducting an ablation study to identify the most critical metrics for accurate usefulness label generation. In conclusion, this work explores LLM-generated usefulness labels by evaluating critical metrics and optimizing for practicality in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

However, their lack of reliability and modularity limits their capacity to tackle large problems that require many steps of reasoning. In response, researchers have proposed advanced pipelines that leverage domain-specific knowledge to chain smaller prompts, provide intermediate feedback and improve performance through search. However, the current complexity of writing, tuning, maintaining and improving such pipelines has limited their sophistication. We propose oracular programming, a foundational paradigm for building LLM-enabled applications that lets domain experts express high-level problem-solving strategies as programs with unresolved choice points. These choice points are resolved at runtime by LLMs, which generalize from user-provided examples of correct and incorrect decisions. An oracular program is composed of three orthogonal components: a strategy that consists in a nondeterministic program with choice points that can be reified into a search tree, a policy that specifies how to navigate this tree with the help of LLM oracles, and a set of demonstrations that describe successful and unsuccessful search tree navigation scenarios across diverse problem instances. Each component is expressed in a dedicated programming language and can be independently improved or substituted. We address the key programming language design challenges of modularly composing oracular programs and enforcing consistency between their components as they evolve.</p></details> |  |

It is critical for the quality assurance of gaming software. Manual playtesting is time-consuming and expensive. However, automating this process is challenging, as playtesting typically requires domain knowledge and problem-solving skills that most conventional testing tools lack. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have opened up new possibilities for applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to playtesting. However, significant challenges remain: current LLMs cannot visually perceive game environments, and most existing research focuses on text-based games or games with robust APIs. Many non-text games lack APIs to provide textual descriptions of game states, making it almost impossible to naively apply LLMs for playtesting. This paper introduces Lap, our novel approach to LLM-based Automatic Playtesting, which uses ChatGPT to test match-3 games, a category of games where players match three or more identical tiles in a row or column to earn points. Lap encompasses three key phases: processing of game environments, prompting-based action generation, and action execution. Given a match-3 game, Lap takes a snapshot of the game board and converts it to a numeric matrix. It then prompts the ChatGPT-O1-mini API to suggest moves based on that matrix and tentatively applies the suggested moves to earn points and trigger changes in the game board. It repeats the above-mentioned three steps iteratively until timeout. For evaluation, we conducted a case study using Lap on an open-source match-3 game, CasseBonbons, and empirically compared it with three existing tools. Our results are promising: Lap outperformed existing tools by achieving higher code coverage and triggering more program crashes. This research sheds light on the future of automatic testing and LLM applications.</p></details> |  |

As a result, many researchers turn to automatic alternatives to accelerate method development. Among these, Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a scalable solution by generating relevance labels directly through prompting. However, prompting an LLM for a relevance label without constraints often results in not only incorrect predictions but also outputs that are difficult for humans to interpret. We propose the Multi-Criteria framework for LLM-based relevance judgments, decomposing the notion of relevance into multiple criteria--such as exactness, coverage, topicality, and contextual fit--to improve the robustness and interpretability of retrieval evaluations compared to direct grading methods. We validate this approach on three datasets: the TREC Deep Learning tracks from 2019 and 2020, as well as LLMJudge (based on TREC DL 2023). Our results demonstrate that Multi-Criteria judgments enhance the system ranking/leaderboard performance. Moreover, we highlight the strengths and limitations of this approach relative to direct grading approaches, offering insights that can guide the development of future automatic evaluation frameworks in information retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, accepted to ICTIR 2025</p></details> |

However, testing, evaluation, and analysis of LLM tool use remain in their early stages. Most existing benchmarks rely on manually collected test cases, many of which cannot be automatically checked for semantic correctness and instead depend on static methods such as string matching. Additionally, these benchmarks often overlook the complex interactions that occur between sequential API calls, which are common in real-world applications. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce StateGen, an automated framework designed to generate diverse coding tasks involving sequential API interactions. StateGen combines state-machine-based API constraint solving and validation, energy-based sampling, and control-flow injection to generate executable programs. These programs are then translated into human-like natural language task descriptions through a collaboration of two LLM agents. Utilizing StateGen, we construct StateEval, a benchmark encompassing 120 verified test cases spanning across three representative scenarios: Session Service, Tensor Operation, and ElevenLabs MCP. Experimental results confirm that StateGen can effectively generate challenging and realistic API-oriented tasks, highlighting areas for improvement in current LLMs incorporating APIs.</p></details> |  |

Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric.

| **[DFRot: Achieving Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free for Rotated LLMs with Refined Rotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00648v3)** | 2025-07-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00648v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotating the activation and weight matrices to reduce the influence of outliers in large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted significant attention, particularly in the context of model quantization. Prior studies have shown that in low-precision quantization scenarios, such as 4-bit weights and 4-bit activations (W4A4), randomized Hadamard transforms can achieve significantly higher accuracy than randomized orthogonal transforms. Notably, the reason behind this phenomenon remains unknown. In this paper, we find that these transformations show substantial improvement in eliminating outliers for common tokens and achieve similar quantization error. The primary reason for the accuracy difference lies in the fact that randomized Hadamard transforms can slightly reduce the quantization error for tokens with massive activations while randomized orthogonal transforms increase the quantization error. Due to the extreme rarity of these tokens and their critical impact on model accuracy, we consider this a long-tail optimization problem, and therefore construct a simple yet effective method: a weighted loss function. Additionally, we propose an optimization strategy for the rotation matrix that involves alternating optimization of quantization parameters while employing orthogonal Procrustes transforms to refine the rotation matrix. This makes the distribution of the rotated activation values more conducive to quantization, especially for tokens with massive activations. Our method enhances the Rotated LLMs by achieving dual free, Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free, dubbed as DFRot. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DFRot. By tuning the rotation matrix using just a single sample, DFRot achieves a perplexity improvement of 0.98 and 0.95 on W4A4KV4 and W4A4KV16, respectively, for LLaMA3-70B, a model known for its quantization challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepeted bythe 2nd Conference on Language Modeling (COLM 2025).

Departing from classical Stackelberg assumptions of complete information and rational agents, our formulation allows each agent to reason through structured prompts, generate probabilistic behaviors via LLMs, and adapt their strategies through internal cognition and belief updates. We define two equilibrium concepts: reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal prompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning equilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized models over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded rationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation. We illustrate the framework through a spearphishing case study, where a sender and a recipient engage in a deception game using structured reasoning prompts. This example highlights the cognitive richness and adversarial potential of LLM-mediated interactions. Our results show that LLM-Stackelberg games provide a powerful paradigm for modeling decision-making in domains such as cybersecurity, misinformation, and recommendation systems.</p></details> |  |

Entity Frequency in Pre-training Induces Asymmetry in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22362v2)** | 2025-07-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.22362v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring reliable content generation. While previous research has primarily focused on "when" LLMs hallucinate, our work explains "why" and directly links model behaviour to the pre-training data that forms their prior knowledge. Specifically, we demonstrate that an asymmetry exists in the recognition of logically equivalent facts, which can be attributed to frequency discrepancies of entities appearing as subjects versus objects. Given that most pre-training datasets are inaccessible, we leverage the fully open-source OLMo series by indexing its Dolma dataset to estimate entity frequencies. Using relational facts (represented as triples) from Wikidata5M, we construct probing datasets to isolate this effect. Our experiments reveal that facts with a high-frequency subject and a low-frequency object are better recognised than their inverse, despite their logical equivalence. The pattern reverses in low-to-high frequency settings, and no statistically significant asymmetry emerges when both entities are high-frequency. These findings highlight the influential role of pre-training data in shaping model predictions and provide insights for inferring the characteristics of pre-training data in closed or partially closed LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLM 2025</p></details> |

However, incorrect outputs pose significant risks in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance. To quantify LLM uncertainty and thereby mitigate these risks, recent works employ conformal prediction (CP), a model- and distribution-agnostic framework that uses LLM outputs to generate a \emph{prediction set} containing the true answer with high probability. Leveraging CP, we propose \emph{conformal revision of questions} (CROQ), which revises the question by narrowing down the available choices to those in the prediction set and asking the LLM the revised question. We expect LLMs to be more accurate on revised questions with fewer choices. Furthermore, we expect CROQ to be effective when the prediction sets from CP are small. Commonly used logit scores often lead to large sets, diminishing CROQ's effectiveness. To overcome this, we propose CP-OPT, an optimization framework to learn scores that minimize set sizes while maintaining coverage. Our extensive experiments on MMLU, ToolAlpaca, and TruthfulQA datasets with multiple LLMs show that CROQ improves accuracy over the standard inference, with more pronounced gains when paired with CP-OPT.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM) output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space, dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting outputs for a variety of topics.

These agents, while capable of accelerating software development, may inadvertently introduce insecure practices. We conducted the first systematic security evaluation of autonomous coding agents, analyzing over 12,000 actions across five state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude variants) on 93 real-world software setup tasks. Our findings reveal significant security concerns: 21% of agent trajectories contained insecure actions, with models showing substantial variation in security behavior. We developed a high-precision detection system that identified four major vulnerability categories, with information exposure (CWE-200) being the most prevalent one. We also evaluated mitigation strategies including feedback mechanisms and security reminders with various effectiveness between models. GPT-4.1 demonstrated exceptional security awareness with 96.8% mitigation success. Our work provides the first comprehensive framework for evaluating coding agent security and highlights the need for security-aware design of next generation LLM-based coding agents.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML community should embrace this development while building the appropriate frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$ cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.</p></details> | CoLM 2025 |

Due to image-level visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects. Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which further improves the performance.

This position paper argues that principled integration of Programming Language (PL) techniques is essential for bridging these gaps. Through structured program representations, formal correctness guarantees, and robust verification mechanisms, PL techniques can elevate LLM-generated code from statistical pattern matching to truly reliable and trustworthy levels. This integration is crucial for developing systems that generate code that is not only functionally correct but also interpretable, verifiable, and ultimately trustworthy.</p></details> |  |

Generative error correction (GER) leverages the rich linguistic knowledge and exceptional reasoning ability of LLMs, significantly outperforming typical LM methods. However, it lacks specificity in accented speech scenarios. In this study, we leverage GER to improve the accuracy of transcription predictions by addressing the two primary features of accented speech recognition. To fully leverage pronunciation information, we propose the multi-modal GER, which integrates pronunciation information from the speech modality, and the multi-granularity GER, which incorporates fine-grained phoneme-level information related to pronunciation. These two methods enable the LLM to utilize the pronunciation information of accented speech and the semantic information from word-level hypotheses for accurate transcription predictions through LoRA fine-tuning. On the one hand, we employ a three-stage training strategy to train separate multi-modal GER models for each accent to obtain mono-accent LoRA experts. By adopting our proposed HDMoLE method, which incorporates hierarchical routing and dynamic thresholds within the mixture of LoRA experts, we effectively merge multiple mono-accent LoRA experts within a single multi-modal GER to overcome the challenges posed by accent diversity. On the other hand, multi-granularity GER leverages the N-best word-level and phoneme-level hypotheses generated by the HDMoLE model to predict the final accented speech transcriptions. Experimental results on the multi-accent English dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods. Our methods achieve a remarkable relative WER reduction of 67.35% compared to the Whisper-large-v3 baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing</p></details> |

Traditional fingerprinting methods often require significant computational overhead or white-box verification access. In this paper, we introduce UTF, a novel and efficient approach to fingerprinting LLMs by leveraging under-trained tokens. Under-trained tokens are tokens that the model has not fully learned during its training phase. By utilizing these tokens, we perform supervised fine-tuning to embed specific input-output pairs into the model. This process allows the LLM to produce predetermined outputs when presented with certain inputs, effectively embedding a unique fingerprint. Our method has minimal overhead and impact on model's performance, and does not require white-box access to target model's ownership identification. Compared to existing fingerprinting methods, UTF is also more effective and robust to fine-tuning and random guess.</p></details> |  |

However, our systematic analysis reveals that current evaluation methodologies frequently exhibit fundamental flaws, often manifesting as common evaluation anti-patterns that obscure true performance characteristics and impede scientific progress. Through a comprehensive examination of recent systems, we identify recurring anti-patterns across three key dimensions: Baseline Fairness, Evaluation Setup, and Metric Design. These anti-patterns are uniquely problematic for LLM inference due to its dual-phase nature combining distinct prefill and decode operations, its handling of highly heterogeneous workloads, and its strict temporal requirements for interactive use. We demonstrate how common anti-patterns -- such as inadequate baseline comparisons that conflate engineering effort with algorithmic novelty, workload selections that fail to represent production scenarios, and metric normalizations that hide substantial performance variability like generation stalls-lead to misleading conclusions. To address these challenges, we provide a comprehensive checklist derived from our analysis, establishing a framework for recognizing and avoiding these anti-patterns in favor of robust LLM inference evaluation. To demonstrate the practical application of our framework, we present a case study analyzing speculative decoding, a technique whose bursty, non-uniform token generation is easily misinterpreted when evaluated using approaches characteristic of these anti-patterns. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for evaluation methodology, enabling meaningful comparisons, ensuring reproducible results, and ultimately accelerating genuine progress in LLM inference systems by moving beyond common anti-patterns to align evaluation with real-world requirements.</p></details> |  |

Next, PRISM uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at: https://github.com/MahdiyarMM/PRISM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While multi-agent frameworks can improve solution quality by leveraging multiple LLMs, existing methods are often computationally expensive, both at training and inference time. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges by training only a single leader LLM to coordinate a team of untrained peer agents. To this end, we propose Multi-agent guided Leader Policy \textbf{O}ptimization (MLPO), a novel approach which trains the leader to evaluate and synthesize agent responses without auxiliary value networks or explicit agent feedback. Leaders trained with MLPO exhibit improved performance not only when interacting with the agent team at inference time, but also enjoy improved performance when deployed in single-agent settings without the team. Empirical results on Big-Bench Hard (BBH), MATH, and MMLU demonstrate that our framework achieves substantial performance improvements over both single-agent and multi-agent baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of training a single, flexible leader for collaborative reasoning in multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness, these systems often incur high latency because real-world problems frequently demand multiple iterative cycles of reasoning steps. To address this challenge, we propose M1-Parallel, a framework that concurrently runs multiple multi-agent teams in parallel to uncover distinct solution paths. By leveraging an event-driven communication model with asynchronous messaging, M1-Parallel efficiently capitalizes on the inherent diversity of valid plans to either reduce end-to-end latency or boost task completion rates. Our experiments on complex tasks show that M1-Parallel with early termination achieves up to $2.2\times$ speedup while preserving accuracy, and that M1-Parallel with aggregation yields higher task completion rates. We further investigate strategies aimed at encouraging diverse execution plans but observe no additional performance gains over repeated sampling. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of parallel plan execution for optimizing multi-agent systems for real-world, high-complexity reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop on MAS</p></details> |

They are often preferred over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task, we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step." can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods.

Publicly available challenge questions offer some benefits but are limited by their small size, narrow scope, and exposure to LLM training. These gaps highlight the need for secure, comprehensive, and representative datasets. Conclusion: A standardized framework is critical for evaluating LLMs in medicine. Collaborative efforts among institutions and policymakers are needed to ensure datasets and methodologies are rigorous, unbiased, and reflective of clinical complexities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Collapse Is Not a Bug but a Feature in Machine Unlearning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04219v2)** | 2025-07-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.04219v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

| **[LLMCup: Ranking-Enhanced Comment Updating with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08671v1)** | 2025-07-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.08671v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While comments are essential for enhancing code readability and maintainability in modern software projects, developers are often motivated to update code but not comments, leading to outdated or inconsistent documentation that hinders future understanding and maintenance. Recent approaches such as CUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural sequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these methods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating, resulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update scenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging large language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in software engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and program repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic behind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment updating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on each update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel comment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies to provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a ranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy, 10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in SentenceBert similarity. Furthermore, a user study shows that comments updated by LLMCup sometimes surpass human-written updates, highlighting the importance of incorporating human evaluation in comment quality assessment.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

One avenue to improve translation accuracy is through intermediate representations, which could provide structured insights to guide the model's understanding. We explore whether code translation using LLMs can benefit from intermediate representations via natural language (NL) and abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Since prompt engineering greatly affects LLM performance, we consider several ways to integrate these representations, from one-shot to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Using Open Gpt4 8X7B and specialized StarCoder and CodeGen models on popular code translation benchmarks (CodeNet and AVATAR), we find that CoT with an intermediate NL summary performs best, with an increase of 13.8% and 6.7%, respectively, in successful translations for the best-performing model (Open Gpt4 8X7B) compared to the zero-shot prompt.</p></details> |  |

It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.</p></details> |  |

While batching is commonly used to increase throughput, performance gains plateau beyond a certain batch size, especially with smaller models, a phenomenon that existing literature typically explains as a shift to the compute-bound regime. In this paper, through an in-depth GPU-level analysis, we reveal that large-batch inference remains memory-bound, with most GPU compute capabilities underutilized due to DRAM bandwidth saturation as the primary bottleneck. To address this, we propose a Batching Configuration Advisor (BCA) that optimizes memory allocation, reducing GPU memory requirements with minimal impact on throughput. The freed memory and underutilized GPU compute capabilities can then be leveraged by concurrent workloads. Specifically, we use model replication to improve serving throughput and GPU utilization. Our findings challenge conventional assumptions about LLM inference, offering new insights and practical strategies for improving resource utilization, particularly for smaller language models.

However, the advent of such systems also raises several questions on the ability of a complex network of agents to effectively self-organize and collaborate. While measuring performance on standard reasoning benchmarks indicates how well multi-agent systems can solve reasoning tasks, it is unclear whether these systems are able to leverage their topology effectively. Here, we propose AgentsNet, a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning. By drawing inspiration from classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet measures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies for problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a network topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet including homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic protocols for organization and communication. We find that some frontier LLMs are already demonstrating strong performance for small networks but begin to fall off once the size of the network scales. While existing multi-agent benchmarks cover at most 2-5 agents, AgentsNet is practically unlimited in size and can scale with new generations of LLMs. As such, we also probe frontier models in a setup with up to 100 agents.</p></details> | Preprint |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> |  |

This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86% in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the superior text mining alternative.</p></details> |  |

The first, carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use.

In this study, we compare three major variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems have introduced unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional prompt injection attacks. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover through the exploitation of trust boundaries within agentic AI systems where autonomous entities interact and influence each other. We demonstrate that adversaries can leverage three distinct attack surfaces - direct prompt injection, RAG backdoor attacks, and inter-agent trust exploitation - to coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4o, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming vulnerability hierarchy: while 41.2% of models succumb to direct prompt injection, 52.9% are vulnerable to RAG backdoor attacks, and a critical 82.4% can be compromised through inter-agent trust exploitation. Notably, we discovered that LLMs which successfully resist direct malicious commands will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents, revealing a fundamental flaw in current multi-agent security models. Our findings demonstrate that only 5.9% of tested models (1/17) proved resistant to all attack vectors, with the majority exhibiting context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our findings also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.</p></details> |  |

Although eliciting manual ethics requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints. Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting. This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.</p></details> |  |

We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents, and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the feasibility of the final proposals.

RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.</p></details> | Preprint |

One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.</p></details> |  |

While a few top performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs) that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second, retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.</p></details> |  |

While recent LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''), they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over 260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases. We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and 18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at Information and Software Technology</p></details> |

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient.

However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for multi-step reasoning processes. Specifically, sparse reward signals fail to deliver effective or sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such reward structures induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across ipntermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a novel method designed to both deliver dense rewards and amplify explorations in the RL-based training paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three key innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; dynamic reward scaling to stabilize exploration and exploitation in large action spaces; and advantage-preserving reward implementation that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across three public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness with a 22.39% improvement on the difficult dataset Countdown-4.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex, non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.</p></details> |  |

We propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy) drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM, fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations, receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise, actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets (Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and mitigating energy inefficiencies.</p></details> |  |

However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory (IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model- and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable proxies based on our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 20th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications (BEA), co-located with ACL 2025</p></details> |

This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.</p></details> |  |

Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space, with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.</p></details> |  |

Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods, TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g., black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type (self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation, calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM</p></details> |  |

We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural: reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm, 48 references</p></details> |

Test-Time Depth Adaptation of Pretrained LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07996v1)** | 2025-07-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.07996v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa, suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget.

Most rely on flat, narrowly scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract, and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist, reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%. Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems, mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated. Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance, showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/yinzhicun/RefSTAR.</p></details> |  |

Yet, these GAN-based approaches struggle to surpass the performance of conventional unsupervised GAN-based frameworks without significantly modifying model structures or increasing the computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for existing restoration models. This strategy utilizes information from the previous stage as feedback to guide subsequent stages, achieving significant performance improvement without increasing the framework's inference complexity. The SC strategy comprises a prompt learning (PL) module and a restorer ($Res$). It iteratively replaces the previous less powerful fixed restorer $\overline{Res}$ in the PL module with a more powerful $Res$. The enhanced PL module generates better pseudo-degraded/clean image pairs, leading to a more powerful $Res$ for the next iteration. Our SC can significantly improve the $Res$'s performance by over 1.5 dB without adding extra parameters or computational complexity during inference. Meanwhile, existing self-ensemble (SE) and our SC strategies enhance the performance of pre-trained restorers from different perspectives. As SE increases computational complexity during inference, we propose a re-boosting module to the SC (Reb-SC) to improve the SC strategy further by incorporating SE into SC without increasing inference time. This approach further enhances the restorer's performance by approximately 0.3 dB. Extensive experimental results on restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art unsupervised restoration methods.

Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code, and dataset of this project will be released at github.com/yangwenbo99/content-degradation-disentanglement.</p></details> |  |

However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code is released at https://github.com/jp-guo/CODiff.</p></details> |  |

Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MP-HSIR}, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

Unlike existing methods, our approach is unsupervised, requires no paired training data, and is applicable to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of tasks, including image restoration, manifold signal reconstruction, and climate data imputation. APS significantly outperforms existing approaches in computational efficiency while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, enabling real-time, high-quality solutions to inverse problems across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

They are a critical tool in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models -- which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project website https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/.</p></details> |  |

Adverse weather significantly degrades image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models, particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revisions: fixed discussion, corrected spelling</p></details> |

Despite the success achieved by existing deep learning-based restoration methods with sophisticated modules, they struggle with rendering computationally-efficient reconstruction results. Moreover, they usually ignore the reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in medical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight Transformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency domain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer (RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling operations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple inferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM. Additionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial domain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and imaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in the design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging the conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational complexity of naive CA by nearly half. Extensive experimental results in various tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LRformer in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples, computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared, higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

These techniques are often not applicable in unconditional generation or in various downstream tasks such as image restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling guidance, called Perturbed-Attention Guidance (PAG), which improves diffusion sample quality across both unconditional and conditional settings, achieving this without requiring additional training or the integration of external modules. PAG is designed to progressively enhance the structure of samples throughout the denoising process. It involves generating intermediate samples with degraded structure by substituting selected self-attention maps in diffusion U-Net with an identity matrix, by considering the self-attention mechanisms' ability to capture structural information, and guiding the denoising process away from these degraded samples. In both ADM and Stable Diffusion, PAG surprisingly improves sample quality in conditional and even unconditional scenarios. Moreover, PAG significantly improves the baseline performance in various downstream tasks where existing guidances such as CG or CFG cannot be fully utilized, including ControlNet with empty prompts and image restoration such as inpainting and deblurring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://ku-cvlab.github.io/Perturbed-Attention-Guidance.

Building upon these achievements, diffusion models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning, these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM), a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring, and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original performance.</p></details> |  |

While T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors. Our experiments demonstrate that EAM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some parts of the thesis require further improvement</p></details> |

Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling.

To address these issues, we propose a Halpern-type PPP (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence and acceleration properties of Halpern's iteration method. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm for image restoration by combining HPPP with denoiser priors such as Plug-and-Play (PnP) prior, which can be viewed as an accelerated PnP method. Finally, numerical experiments including several toy examples and image restoration validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text recognition accuracy.

However, SSM-based approaches exhibit limitations in reconstructing localized structures and tend to be less effective when handling high-dimensional data, frequently resulting in suboptimal recovery of fine image features. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Laplace-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Laplace frequency prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing. Leveraging the Laplace decomposition, the image is disentangled into low-frequency components capturing global texture and high-frequency components representing edges and fine details. This decomposition enables specialized processing via dual parallel pathways: the low-frequency branch employs SSMs for global context modeling, while the high-frequency branch utilizes CNNs to refine local structural details, effectively addressing diverse haze scenarios. Notably, the Laplace transformation facilitates information-preserving downsampling of low-frequency components in accordance with the Nyquist theory, thereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency.

Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score (CRPS).</p></details> |  |

The emergence of Vision Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba (EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising, deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks, improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors, further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR. Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing general IR architectures.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space. However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks with only 1M parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

We analyze this phenomenon from the perspective of networks attempting to bypass constraints imposed by conventional LayerNorm due to conflicts against requirements in IR tasks. Accordingly, we address two misalignments between LayerNorm and IR tasks, and later show that addressing these mismatches leads to both stabilized training dynamics and improved IR performance. Specifically, conventional LayerNorm works in a per-token manner, disrupting spatial correlations between tokens, essential in IR tasks. Also, it employs an input-independent normalization that restricts the flexibility of feature scales, required to preserve input-specific statistics. Together, these mismatches significantly hinder IR Transformer's ability to accurately preserve low-level features throughout the network. To this end, we introduce Image Restoration Transformer Tailored Layer Normalization~(i-LN), a surprisingly simple drop-in replacement for conventional LayerNorm. We propose to normalize features in a holistic manner across the entire spatio-channel dimension, preserving spatial relationships among individual tokens. Additionally, we introduce an input-adaptive rescaling strategy that maintains the feature range flexibility required by individual inputs. Together, these modifications effectively contribute to preserving low-level feature statistics of inputs throughout IR Transformers. Experimental results verify that this combined strategy enhances both the stability and performance of IR Transformers across various IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features, conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer (TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training convergence, and generalization.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with an accurate understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe degradation.</p></details> |  |

With the emergence of state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels, effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while preserving semantic consistency.</p></details> |  |

Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) Omni-Scale 2D State Evolution extends RWKV's location-dependent parameterization to hierarchical multi-directional 2D scanning, enabling global contextual awareness with linear complexity O(L); (2) Chunk-Optimized Flash Processing accelerates intra-chunk parallelism by 3.2x via contiguous chunk processing (O(LCd) complexity), reducing sequential dependencies and computational overhead; (3) Prior-Guided Efficient Diffusion extracts a compact Image Prior Representation (IPR) in only 5-20 steps, proving 45% faster training/inference than DiffIR while solving computational inefficiency in denoising. Evaluated across super-resolution and inpainting benchmarks (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, Places365), DiffRWKVIR outperforms SwinIR, HAT, and MambaIR/v2 in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and efficiency metrics. Our method establishes a new paradigm for adaptive, high-efficiency image restoration with optimized hardware utilization.</p></details> |  |

Existing generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation, which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow, a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks, offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 Final Version; Corresponding Author: Bing Li</p></details> |

In this work, we propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors, Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 Final Version; Corresponding Author: Bing Li</p></details> |

Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes, which pose significant challenges for existing methods. Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing and often introduce artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT) modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing. The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration performance.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to traditional approaches -- which typically assume full knowledge of the forward model or access to paired degraded and ground-truth images -- the proposed method operates under minimal assumptions and relies only on small, unpaired datasets. This makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios, where the forward model is often unknown or misspecified, and collecting paired data is costly or infeasible. The method leverages conditional flow matching to model the distribution of degraded observations, while simultaneously learning the forward model via a distribution-matching loss that arises naturally from the framework. Empirically, it outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches on deblurring and non-uniform point spread function (PSF) calibration tasks. It also matches state-of-the-art performance on blind super-resolution. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method with a proof of concept for lens calibration: a real-world application traditionally requiring time-consuming experiments and specialized equipment. In contrast, our approach achieves this with minimal data acquisition effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/inria-thoth/ddm4ip</p></details> |

A popular class of methods, based on Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable posterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression for the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in terms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze the time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step sizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that these step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as colorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity, this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables sampling with fewer time steps than DPS.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities. A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark, ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time by 20 percent. These results highlight the importance of intensity-specific processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks.

Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, also highly effective in other image restoration tasks.

Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging a theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures, highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

While ViTs generally outperform CNNs by effectively capturing long-range dependencies and input-specific characteristics, their computational complexity increases quadratically with image resolution. This limitation hampers their practical application in high-resolution image restoration. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) for visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. In addition, to more effectively capture and represent local information, we propose an efficient discriminative frequency domain-based feedforward network (EDFFN), which can effectively estimate useful frequency information for latent clear image restoration. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and real-world images.

Traditional IR methods typically focus on specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive overview of AiOIR, offering a taxonomy that organizes existing methods by architecture innovations, learning strategies, and key improvements. We systematically categorize prevailing approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. Our survey begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of typical scenarios.

Even if they produce impressive image restoration results, these algorithms rely on a non-standard use of a denoiser on images that are less and less noisy along the iterations, which contrasts with recent algorithms based on Diffusion Models (DM), where the denoiser is applied only on re-noised images. We propose a new PnP framework, called Stochastic deNOising REgularization (SNORE), which applies the denoiser only on images with noise of the adequate level. It is based on an explicit stochastic regularization, which leads to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve ill-posed inverse problems. A convergence analysis of this algorithm and its annealing extension is provided. Experimentally, we prove that SNORE is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art methods on deblurring and inpainting tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception Block} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low computational overhead.

ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios.

While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity, preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual quality and quantitative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p></details> |  |

The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information when shaping the prior, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, taking advantage of the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025 - Camera Ready Version</p></details> |

UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality.

| **[UniRes: Universal Image Restoration for Complex Degradations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05599v1)** | 2025-06-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.05599v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines. Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations, i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework, named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner. It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps, hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex degradations.</p></details> |  |

While several distillation-based approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration, extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored, particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2, which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically, an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses, including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a single step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft Ver.

However, accelerated acquisition often degrades image quality, impairing the visibility of fine anatomical details and potentially compromising diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, utilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance pediatric rapid bone scintigraphy. Our approach employs two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, supported by three specialized modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules inject domain-specific semantic cues from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM preserves coherent semantic feature representations across both cascaded stages. Moreover, we present RBS, a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset comprising paired standard (20 cm/min) and rapid (40 cm/min) scans from 137 pediatric patients aged 0.5 - 16 years, making it the first dataset tailored for pediatric rapid bone scintigraphy restoration. Extensive experiments on both a public endoscopic dataset and our RBS dataset demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing techniques in PSNR, SSIM, FID, and LPIPS metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

By integrating the Mamba network architecture with the diffusion model, the condition network achieves refined conditional control, thereby enhancing the control and optimization of the image generation process. To evaluate the robustness and generalization capability of our method across various image degradation conditions, extensive experiments were conducted on several benchmark datasets, including Rain100H, Rain100L, GoPro, and SSID. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently surpasses existing methods in perceptual quality metrics, such as LPIPS and FID, while maintaining comparable performance in image distortion metrics, including PSNR and SSIM, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability. Notably, ablation experiments reveal that directly noise prediction in the diffusion process achieves better performance, effectively balancing noise suppression and detail preservation. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the Mamba architecture is particularly well-suited as a conditional control network for diffusion models, outperforming both CNN- and Attention-based approaches in this context. Overall, these results highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of ControlMambaIR in addressing a range of image restoration perceptual challenges.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an innovative multi-modal watermarking approach, drawing on the concept of vector discretization in encoder-based vector quantization. By constructing adjacency matrices, the proposed method enables the transformation of text watermarks into robust image-based representations, providing a novel multi-modal watermarking paradigm for image generation applications. Additionally, this study presents a newly designed image restoration module to mitigate image degradation caused by transmission losses and various noise interferences, thereby ensuring the reliability and integrity of the watermark. Experimental results validate the robustness of the method under multiple noise attacks, providing a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for digital image copyright protection.</p></details> |  |

This challenge established a new benchmark for real-world image restoration, featuring diverse scenarios with and without reference ground truth. Participants were tasked with restoring real-captured images suffering from complex and unknown degradations, where both perceptual quality and fidelity were critically evaluated. The challenge comprised two tracks: (1) the low-light joint denoising and demosaicing (JDD) task, and (2) the image detail enhancement/generation task. Each track included two sub-tasks. The first sub-task involved paired data with available ground truth, enabling quantitative evaluation.

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025 (Highlight); Project Page: https://unirestore.github.io</p></details> |

Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |

It can alleviate the data collection burden and enhance the practical applicability of deep learning techniques. However, existing methods suffer from two key drawbacks. Firstly, they are ineffective in handling spatially correlated noise commonly observed in practical applications such as low-light imaging and remote sensing. Secondly, they rely on pixel-wise loss functions that only provide limited supervision information. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging the Fourier domain. We highlight that the Fourier coefficients of spatially correlated noise exhibit sparsity and independence, making them easier to handle. Additionally, Fourier coefficients contain global information, enabling more significant supervision. Motivated by these insights, we propose to establish noisy supervision in the Fourier domain. We first prove that Fourier coefficients of a wide range of noise converge in distribution to the Gaussian distribution. Exploiting this statistical property, we establish the equivalence between using noisy targets and clean targets in the Fourier domain. This leads to a unified learning framework applicable to various image restoration tasks, diverse network architectures, and different noise models. Extensive experiments validate the outstanding performance of this framework in terms of both quantitative indices and perceptual quality.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically require training a bridge model from scratch for each specific type of degradation, resulting in high computational costs and limited performance. This work aims to efficiently leverage pretrained generative priors within existing image restoration bridges to eliminate this requirement. The main challenge is that standard generative models are typically designed for a diffusion process that starts from pure noise, while restoration tasks begin with a low-quality image, resulting in a mismatch in the state distributions between the two processes. To address this challenge, we propose a transition equation that bridges two diffusion processes with the same endpoint distribution. Based on this, we introduce the IRBridge framework, which enables the direct utilization of generative models within image restoration bridges, offering a more flexible and adaptable approach to image restoration. Extensive experiments on six image restoration tasks demonstrate that IRBridge efficiently integrates generative priors, resulting in improved robustness and generalization performance.

This paper introduces Self-Improved Privilege Learning (SIPL), a novel paradigm that overcomes these limitations by innovatively extending the utility of privileged information (PI) beyond training into the inference stage. Unlike conventional Privilege Learning, where ground-truth-derived guidance is typically discarded after training, SIPL empowers the model to leverage its own preliminary outputs as pseudo-privileged signals for iterative self-refinement at test time. Central to SIPL is Proxy Fusion, a lightweight module incorporating a learnable Privileged Dictionary. During training, this dictionary distills essential high-frequency and structural priors from privileged feature representations. Critically, at inference, the same learned dictionary then interacts with features derived from the model's initial restoration, facilitating a self-correction loop. SIPL can be seamlessly integrated into various backbone architectures, offering substantial performance improvements with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIPL significantly advances the state-of-the-art on diverse all-in-one image restoration benchmarks. For instance, when integrated with the PromptIR model, SIPL achieves remarkable PSNR improvements of +4.58 dB on composite degradation tasks and +1.28 dB on diverse five-task benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness and broad applicability. Codes are available at our project page https://github.com/Aitical/SIPL.</p></details> |  |

However, generating accurate lesion descriptions remains challenging due to spurious correlations from visual-linguistic biases and inherent limitations of radiological imaging, such as low resolution and noise interference. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage framework named CrossModal Causal Representation Learning (CMCRL), consisting of the Radiological Cross-modal Alignment and Reconstruction Enhanced (RadCARE) pre-training and the Visual-Linguistic Causal Intervention (VLCI) fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, RadCARE introduces a degradation-aware masked image restoration strategy tailored for radiological images, which reconstructs high-resolution patches from low-resolution inputs to mitigate noise and detail loss. Combined with a multiway architecture and four adaptive training strategies (e.g., text postfix generation with degraded images and text prefixes), RadCARE establishes robust cross-modal correlations even with incomplete data. In the VLCI phase, we deploy causal front-door intervention through two modules: the Visual Deconfounding Module (VDM) disentangles local-global features without fine-grained annotations, while the Linguistic Deconfounding Module (LDM) eliminates context bias without external terminology databases. Experiments on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR show that our CMCRL pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both stages.

PnP approaches, a class of iterative algorithms where regularization is implicitly performed by an off-the-shelf deep denoiser, are flexible for varying compression ratios (CRs) but are limited in reconstruction accuracy and speed. Conversely, unrolling approaches, a class of multi-stage neural networks where a truncated iterative optimization process is transformed into an end-to-end trainable network, typically achieve better accuracy with faster inference but require fine-tuning or even retraining when CR changes. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating the strengths of both classes of solvers. To this end, we design an efficient deep image restorer (DIR) for the unrolling of HQS (half quadratic splitting) and ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers). More importantly, a general proximal trajectory (PT) loss function is proposed to train HQS/ADMM-unrolling networks such that learned DIR approximates the proximal operator of an ideal explicit restoration regularizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, the resulting proximal unrolling networks can not only flexibly handle varying CRs with a single model like PnP algorithms, but also outperform previous CR-specific unrolling networks in both reconstruction accuracy and speed.

To address these challenges, we introduce a Unified Receptance Weighted Key Value (URWKV) model with multi-state perspective, enabling flexible and effective degradation restoration for low-light images. Specifically, we customize the core URWKV block to perceive and analyze complex degradations by leveraging multiple intra- and inter-stage states. First, inspired by the pupil mechanism in the human visual system, we propose Luminance-adaptive Normalization (LAN) that adjusts normalization parameters based on rich inter-stage states, allowing for adaptive, scene-aware luminance modulation. Second, we aggregate multiple intra-stage states through exponential moving average approach, effectively capturing subtle variations while mitigating information loss inherent in the single-state mechanism. To reduce the degradation effects commonly associated with conventional skip connections, we propose the State-aware Selective Fusion (SSF) module, which dynamically aligns and integrates multi-state features across encoder stages, selectively fusing contextual information. In comparison to state-of-the-art models, our URWKV model achieves superior performance on various benchmarks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However, due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers. EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |

Although existing AiOIR approaches obtain promising performance in closed and controlled scenarios, they still suffered from considerable performance reduction in real-world scenarios since the gap of data distributions between the training samples (source domain) and real-world test samples (target domain) can lead inferior degradation awareness ability. To address this issue, a Unified Domain-Adaptive Image Restoration (UDAIR) framework is proposed to effectively achieve AiOIR by leveraging the learned knowledge from source domain to target domain. To improve the degradation identification, a codebook is designed to learn a group of discrete embeddings to denote the degradation patterns, and the cross-sample contrastive learning mechanism is further proposed to capture shared features from different samples of certain degradation. To bridge the data gap, a domain adaptation strategy is proposed to build the feature projection between the source and target domains by dynamically aligning their codebook embeddings, and a correlation alignment-based test-time adaptation mechanism is designed to fine-tune the alignment discrepancies by tightening the degradation embeddings to the corresponding cluster center in the source domain. Experimental results on 10 open-source datasets demonstrate that UDAIR achieves new state-of-the-art performance for the AiOIR task. Most importantly, the feature cluster validate the degradation identification under unknown conditions, and qualitative comparisons showcase robust generalization to real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

An image restoration model is trained on this synthetic data, using multi-directional patch extraction and fusion to process large images. Second, a ByT5 post-OCR model, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text pairs, addresses remaining OCR errors. Detailed experiments on 13,831 pages of real historical documents in English, French, and Spanish show that the PreP-OCR pipeline reduces character error rates by 63.9-70.3% compared to OCR on raw images. Our pipeline demonstrates the potential of integrating image restoration with linguistic error correction for digitizing historical archives.</p></details> | ACL 2025 main |

While reference faces offer a path forward, existing reference-based methods often fail to fully exploit their potential. This paper introduces a novel approach that maximizes reference face utility for improved face restoration and identity preservation. Our method makes three key contributions: 1) Composite Context, a comprehensive representation that fuses multi-level (high- and low-level) information from the reference face, offering richer guidance than prior singular representations. 2) Hard Example Identity Loss, a novel loss function that leverages the reference face to address the identity learning inefficiencies found in the existing identity loss. 3) A training-free method to adapt the model to multi-reference inputs during inference. The proposed method demonstrably restores high-quality faces and achieves state-of-the-art identity preserving restoration on benchmarks such as FFHQ-Ref and CelebA-Ref-Test, consistently outperforming previous work.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we seek the multi-source unified representation by introducing a multi-source latent optimal transport barycenter problem, in which a continuous barycenter map is learned to transport the latent representations to the barycenter space. The transport cost is designed such that the representations from source-specific subspaces are contrasted with each other while maintaining orthogonality to those from the barycenter space. This enables BaryIR to learn compact representations with unified degradation-agnostic information from the barycenter space, as well as degradation-specific semantics from source-specific subspaces, capturing the inherent geometry of multi-source data manifold for generalizable AIR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Particularly, BaryIR exhibits superior generalization ability to real-world data and unseen degradations. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/xl-tang3/BaryIR.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods often suffer from limited representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration, providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, persistent visual degradation, including smoke generated by energy devices, lens fogging from thermal gradients, and lens contamination due to blood or tissue fluid splashes during surgical procedures, severely impair visual clarity. These degenerations can seriously hinder surgical workflow and pose risks to patient safety. To systematically investigate and address various forms of surgical scene degradation, we introduce a real-world open-source surgical image restoration dataset covering laparoscopic environments, called SurgClean, which involves multi-type image restoration tasks, e.g., desmoking, defogging, and desplashing. SurgClean comprises 1,020 images with diverse degradation types and corresponding paired reference labels. Based on SurgClean, we establish a standardized evaluation benchmark and provide performance for 22 representative generic task-specific image restoration approaches, including 12 generic and 10 task-specific image restoration approaches. Experimental results reveal substantial performance gaps relative to clinical requirements, highlighting a critical opportunity for algorithm advancements in intelligent surgical restoration. Furthermore, we explore the degradation discrepancies between surgical and natural scenes from structural perception and semantic understanding perspectives, providing fundamental insights for domain-specific image restoration research. Our work aims to empower the capabilities of restoration algorithms to increase surgical environments and improve the efficiency of clinical procedures.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, especially those relying on direct image-to-image restoration, often fail to disentangle these intertwined artifacts effectively. While wavelet-based frequency-aware approaches offer a promising direction, their potential remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Freqformer, a Transformer-based framework specifically designed for image demoir\'eing through targeted frequency separation. Our method performs an effective frequency decomposition that explicitly splits moir\'e patterns into high-frequency spatially-localized textures and low-frequency scale-robust color distortions, which are then handled by a dual-branch architecture tailored to their distinct characteristics. We further propose a learnable Frequency Composition Transform (FCT) module to adaptively fuse the frequency-specific outputs, enabling consistent and high-fidelity reconstruction. To better aggregate the spatial dependencies and the inter-channel complementary information, we introduce a Spatial-Aware Channel Attention (SA-CA) module that refines moir\'e-sensitive regions without incurring high computational cost. Extensive experiments on various demoir\'eing benchmarks demonstrate that Freqformer achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact model size.

Despite recent advances, most existing approaches treat IR as a direct mapping problem, relying on shared representations across degradation types without modeling their structural diversity. In this work, we present MIRAGE, a unified and lightweight framework for all in one IR that explicitly decomposes the input feature space into three semantically aligned parallel branches, each processed by a specialized module attention for global context, convolution for local textures, and MLP for channel-wise statistics. This modular decomposition significantly improves generalization and efficiency across diverse degradations. Furthermore, we introduce a cross layer contrastive learning scheme that aligns shallow and latent features to enhance the discriminability of shared representations. To better capture the underlying geometry of feature representations, we perform contrastive learning in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space rather than the conventional Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that MIRAGE not only achieves new state of the art performance across a variety of degradation types but also offers a scalable solution for challenging all-in-one IR scenarios.

However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/restorevarpage/</p></details> |

However, UniDB's reliance on iterative Euler sampling methods results in slow, computationally expensive inference, while existing acceleration techniques for diffusion or diffusion bridge models fail to address its unique challenges: missing terminal mean constraints and SOC-specific penalty coefficients in its SDEs. We present UniDB++, a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly improves upon these limitations. The method's key advancement comes from deriving exact closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDEs, effectively reducing the error accumulation inherent in Euler approximations and enabling high-quality generation with up to 20$\times$ fewer sampling steps. This method is further complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains perceptual quality for low-step regimes (5-10 steps). Additionally, we demonstrate that UniDB++ aligns with existing diffusion bridge acceleration methods by evaluating their update rules, and UniDB++ can recover DBIMs as special cases under some theoretical conditions. Experiments demonstrate UniDB++'s state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks, outperforming Euler-based methods in fidelity and speed while reducing inference time significantly. This work bridges the gap between theoretical generality and practical efficiency in SOC-driven diffusion bridge models.

Accurately estimating the underlying degradation can intuitively provide restoration models with more targeted and effective guidance, enabling adaptive processing strategies. To this end, we propose a Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism (MODEM) for adverse weather image restoration. Central to MODEM is the Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module (MOS2D), which integrates Morton-coded spatial ordering with selective state-space models to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local structural coherence. Complementing MOS2D, we introduce a Dual Degradation Estimation Module (DDEM) that disentangles and estimates both global and local degradation priors. These priors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and context-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex degradation dynamics. Our code will be released at https://github.com/hainuo-wang/MODEM.git.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce a new approach to solving MAP problems with diffusion model priors using a dual ascent optimization framework.

In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent linear stochastic differential equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its simplicity, achieves competitive performance on various image-conditioned (e.g., image restoration) and unconditional generation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generative modelling.

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradation specific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms state-of-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models.</p></details> |  |

This paper first explores the challenging multi-weather nighttime image restoration task, where various types of weather degradations are intertwined with flare effects. To support the research, we contribute the AllWeatherNight dataset, featuring large-scale high-quality nighttime images with diverse compositional degradations, synthesized using our introduced illumination-aware degradation generation. Moreover, we present ClearNight, a unified nighttime image restoration framework, which effectively removes complex degradations in one go. Specifically, ClearNight extracts Retinex-based dual priors and explicitly guides the network to focus on uneven illumination regions and intrinsic texture contents respectively, thereby enhancing restoration effectiveness in nighttime scenarios. In order to better represent the common and unique characters of multiple weather degradations, we introduce a weather-aware dynamic specific-commonality collaboration method, which identifies weather degradations and adaptively selects optimal candidate units associated with specific weather types. Our ClearNight achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world images. Comprehensive ablation experiments validate the necessity of AllWeatherNight dataset as well as the effectiveness of ClearNight.

As compared with the traditional discrete framework, the continuous framework demonstrates inherent superiority for data representation and reconstruction (e.g., image restoration, novel view synthesis, and waveform inversion) by offering inherent advantages including resolution flexibility, cross-modal adaptability, inherent smoothness, and parameter efficiency. In this review, we systematically examine recent advancements in continuous representation frameworks, focusing on three aspects: (i) Continuous representation method designs such as basis function representation, statistical modeling, tensor function decomposition, and implicit neural representation; (ii) Theoretical foundations of continuous representations such as approximation error analysis, convergence property, and implicit regularization; (iii) Real-world applications of continuous representations derived from computer vision, graphics, bioinformatics, and remote sensing.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer hinders its applicability to high-resolution images. Existing methods mitigate this issue with sparse or window-based attention, yet inherently limit global context modeling. Linear attention, a variant of softmax attention, demonstrates promise in global context modeling while maintaining linear complexity, offering a potential solution to the above challenge. Despite its efficiency benefits, vanilla linear attention suffers from a significant performance drop in IR, largely due to the low-rank nature of its attention map. To counter this, we propose Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA), a simple yet effective method that enriches feature representations by integrating a lightweight depthwise convolution. Building upon RELA, we propose an efficient and effective image restoration Transformer, named LAformer. LAformer achieves effective global perception by integrating linear attention and channel attention, while also enhancing local fitting capabilities through a convolutional gated feed-forward network. Notably, LAformer eliminates hardware-inefficient operations such as softmax and window shifting, enabling efficient processing of high-resolution images. Extensive experiments across 7 IR tasks and 21 benchmarks demonstrate that LAformer outperforms SOTA methods and offers significant computational advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs 3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning the interval-averaged velocity via the MeanFlow Identity, our policy avoids any additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1 further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference. We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster than FlowPolicy. Our code is available at https://mp1-2254.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes, moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and loss of details.

Physics-based Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) present a transformative paradigm by directly harnessing intrinsic physical dynamics for computation rather than expending resources to enforce idealized digital abstractions. By relaxing the constraints needed for traditional ASICs, like enforced statelessness, unidirectionality, determinism, and synchronization, these devices aim to operate as exact realizations of physical processes, offering substantial gains in energy efficiency and computational throughput. This approach enables novel co-design strategies, aligning algorithmic requirements with the inherent computational primitives of physical systems. Physics-based ASICs could accelerate critical AI applications like diffusion models, sampling, optimization, and neural network inference as well as traditional computational workloads like scientific simulation of materials and molecules. Ultimately, this vision points towards a future of heterogeneous, highly-specialized computing platforms capable of overcoming current scaling bottlenecks and unlocking new frontiers in computational power and efficiency.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling.

However, bundle-item(B-I) affiliation will vary dynamically in real scenarios. For example, a bundle themed as 'casual outfit', may add 'hat' or remove 'watch' due to factors such as seasonal variations, changes in user pes or inventory adjustments. Our empirical study demonstrates that the performance of mainstream BR models will fluctuate or even decline regarding item-level variability. This paper makes the first attempt to referencaddress the above problem and proposes a novel Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation(RDiffBR) as a model-agnostic generative framework which can assist a BR model in adapting this scenario. During the initial training of the BR model, RDiffBR employs a residual diffusion model to process the item-level bundle embeddings which are generated by BR model to represent bundle theme via a forward-reverse process. In the inference stage, RDiffBR reverses item-level bundle embeddings obtained by the well-trained bundle model under B-I variability scenarios to generate the effective item-level bundle embeddings. In particular, the residual connection in our residual approximator significantly enhances item-level bundle embeddings generation ability of BR models. Experiments on six BR models and four public datasets from different domains show that RDiffBR improves the performance of Recall and NDCG of backbone BR models by up to 23%, while only increased training time about 4%.Codes and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RDiffBR.</p></details> |  |

To address this, network quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the quality of the generated images across various datasets.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

However, designing target-specific cyclic peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap, we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84% on different cyclization strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, previous works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment, we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

To better understand and control the risks, various researchers have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and designed prompts. In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly, benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.</p></details> |  |

However, in practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space. In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of image generative models to augment human creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is available at https://imagineforme.github.io/</p></details> |

However, some challenging OOD samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space, can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced, boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score, effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by 11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.</p></details> |  |

However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity, clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and identity-preserving full-body synthesis.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

While prior approaches-including waveform and spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps, they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset, extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for restoring degraded musical recordings.

However, limited by the input length of the text encoder, CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1) A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction. (3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with long-text input.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we make a key observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias across different model architectures.

To this end, we propose a selective optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable, high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that existing autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders (LDMAEs).

Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching. Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |

Existing studies employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset, Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be released after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

We propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image, predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos.

In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic design tasks.

Recently, a successful training-free conditional generation approach incorporates conditions via posterior sampling, which relies on the availability of a score function in the unconditional diffusion model. However, flow matching models do not possess an explicit score function, rendering such a strategy inapplicable. Approximate posterior sampling for flow matching has been explored, but it is limited to linear inverse problems. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching-based Posterior Sampling (FMPS) to expand its application scope. We introduce a correction term by steering the velocity field. This correction term can be reformulated to incorporate a surrogate score function, thereby bridging the gap between flow matching models and score-based posterior sampling. Hence, FMPS enables the posterior sampling to be adjusted within the flow matching framework. Further, we propose two practical implementations of the correction mechanism: one aimed at improving generation quality, and the other focused on computational efficiency. Experimental results on diverse conditional generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation quality compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness and generality of FMPS.</p></details> |  |

But they face limitations like rigid source distributions and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility, while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM). CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model, enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce a new method for video generation that focuses on hand-centric actions. Our diffusion-based method incorporates two distinct innovations. First, we propose an automatic method to generate the motion area -- the region in the video in which the detailed activities occur -- guided by both the visual context and the action text prompt, rather than assuming this region can be provided manually as is now commonplace.

However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we present Feynman-Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models - even with off-the-shelf rewards - can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards a given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce a new concept (e.g., photographic style) -- all during test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations.

However, real-world datasets are often limited in size and exhibit underrepresentation across key subpopulations, leading to biased predictions and reduced performance, particularly in supervised tasks such as classification. To address these challenges, we propose Conditional Data Synthesis Augmentation (CoDSA), a novel framework that leverages generative models, such as diffusion models, to synthesize high-fidelity data for improving model performance across multimodal domains including tabular, textual, and image data. CoDSA generates synthetic samples that faithfully capture the conditional distributions of the original data, with a focus on under-sampled or high-interest regions. Through transfer learning, CoDSA fine-tunes pre-trained generative models to enhance the realism of synthetic data and increase sample density in sparse areas. This process preserves inter-modal relationships, mitigates data imbalance, improves domain adaptation, and boosts generalization. We also introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the statistical accuracy improvements enabled by CoDSA as a function of synthetic sample volume and targeted region allocation, providing formal guarantees of its effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDSA consistently outperforms non-adaptive augmentation strategies and state-of-the-art baselines in both supervised and unsupervised settings.</p></details> |  |

However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code is released at https://github.com/jp-guo/CODiff.</p></details> |  |

VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD). $L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, existing multi-task planners or policies typically rely on task-specific demonstrations via multi-task imitation, or require task-specific reward labels to facilitate policy optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL). They are costly due to the substantial human efforts required to collect expert data or design reward functions. To address these challenges, we aim to develop a versatile diffusion planner capable of leveraging large-scale inferior data that contains task-agnostic sub-optimal trajectories, with the ability to fast adapt to specific tasks. In this paper, we propose SODP, a two-stage framework that leverages Sub-Optimal data to learn a Diffusion Planner, which is generalizable for various downstream tasks. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we train a foundation diffusion planner that extracts general planning capabilities by modeling the versatile distribution of multi-task trajectories, which can be sub-optimal and has wide data coverage. Then for downstream tasks, we adopt RL-based fine-tuning with task-specific rewards to quickly refine the diffusion planner, which aims to generate action sequences with higher task-specific returns. Experimental results from multi-task domains including Meta-World and Adroit demonstrate that SODP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only a small amount of data for reward-guided fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2025</p></details> |

While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task.

In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

While several anomaly synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies, enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks, while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and classification.</p></details> |  |

Although there are several well-known phase retrieval algorithms, including classical iterative solvers, the reconstruction performance often remains sensitive to initialization and measurement noise. Recently, image-to-image diffusion models have gained traction in various image reconstruction tasks, yielding significant theoretical insights and practical breakthroughs. In this work, we introduce a novel phase retrieval approach based on an image-to-image diffusion framework called Inversion by Direct Iteration. Our method begins with an enhanced initialization stage that leverages a hybrid iterative technique, combining the Hybrid Input-Output and Error Reduction methods and incorporating a novel acceleration mechanism to obtain a robust crude estimate. Then, it iteratively refines this initial crude estimate using the learned image-to-image pipeline. Our method achieves substantial improvements in both training efficiency and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our approach utilizes aggregation techniques to refine quality metrics and demonstrates superior results compared to both classical and contemporary techniques. This highlights its potential for effective and efficient phase retrieval across various applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods, have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation. We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality, stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative possibilities for artists and designers.</p></details> | 14 pages, 16 figures |

CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning.</p></details> |  |

Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively expanding promising trajectories while retaining the flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD achieves the benefits of MCTS such as controlling exploration-exploitation trade-offs within the diffusion framework. Empirical results on challenging long-horizon tasks show that MCTD outperforms diffusion baselines, yielding higher-quality solutions as inference-time computation increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, ICML 2025 Main Track Spotlight</p></details> |

However, achieving a performance balance between communication and sensing in the dual-function radar communication (DFRC)-based ISAC system remains a significant challenge. In this paper, a low-altitude intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted ISAC system is explored, where a base station (BS) supports dual-functional operations, enabling both data transmission for multiple users and sensing for a blocked target, with the channel quality enhanced by an IRS mounted on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Moreover, we formulate an integrated communication, sensing, and energy efficiency multi-objective optimization problem (CSEMOP), which aims to maximize the communication rate of the users and the sensing rate of the target, while minimizing UAV propulsion energy consumption by jointly optimizing the BS beamforming matrix, IRS phase shifts, the flight velocity and angle of the UAV. Considering the non-convexity, trade-off, and dynamic nature of the formulated CSEMOP, we propose a generative diffusion model-based deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMDDPG) algorithm to solve the problem. Specifically, the diffusion model is incorporated into the actor network of DDPG to improve the action quality, with noise perturbation mechanism for better exploration and recent prioritized experience replay (RPER) sampling mechanism for enhanced training efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the GDMDDPG algorithm delivers superior performance compared to the existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional predictive models constrained by limited generalization capabilities, MobiWorld exhibits strong universality by integrating heterogeneous data sources, including sensors, mobile devices, and base stations, as well as multimodal data types such as sequences and images. It is capable of generating both network element-level observations (e.g., traffic load, user distribution) and system-level performance indicators (e.g., throughput, energy consumption) to support a wide range of planning and optimization tasks. Built upon advanced diffusion models, MobiWorld offers powerful controllable generation capabilities by modeling the joint distribution between mobile network data and diverse conditional factors including spatio temporal contexts, user behaviors, and optimization policies. This enables accurate simulation of dynamic network states under varying policy configurations, providing optimization agents with precise environmental feedback and facilitating effective decision-making without relying on costly real-network interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MobiWorld in a collaborative energy-saving scenario, where an agent uses observations and rewards generated by MobiWorld to optimize base station sleep and user offloading policies. Experimental results show that MobiWorld exhibits strong controllable generation performance and outperforms traditional methods in energy optimization.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

From a data-centric perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a "synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality.

In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines.

Conventional generative models can intuitively generate vector fields from user sketches, but remain difficult to consider physical properties. Therefore, we add a simple editing process after generating the vector field. In the first stage, we use a latent diffusion model~(LDM) to automatically generate initial 2D vector fields from user sketches. In the second stage, we apply the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition to locally extract physical properties such as incompressibility from the results generated by LDM and recompose them according to user intentions.

Leveraging the Informative Drawings model, we transform these RGB images into rough sketches, which are further refined into structured guidance sketches using a custom-designed optimizer. The proposed system offers precise, real-time guidance aligned with the creative intent of the user, significantly enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of the drawing process. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a user study, gathering empirical feedback on both system performance and interface usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures.

Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it, we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Recently, this framework has been extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point cloud self-supervised learning.

Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2025. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.16503</p></details> |

Such an imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions. Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and ImageNetLT.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

This paper theoretically analyzes CFG in the context of masked discrete diffusion, focusing on the role of guidance schedules. Our analysis shows that high guidance early in sampling (when inputs are heavily masked) harms generation quality, while late-stage guidance has a larger effect. These findings provide a theoretical explanation for empirical observations in recent studies on guidance schedules. The analysis also reveals an imperfection of the current CFG implementations. These implementations can unintentionally cause imbalanced transitions, such as unmasking too rapidly during the early stages of generation, which degrades the quality of the resulting samples. To address this, we draw insight from the analysis and propose a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism empirically applicable to any discrete diffusion. Intuitively, our method smoothens the transport between the data distribution and the initial (masked/uniform) distribution, which results in improved sample quality. Remarkably, our method is achievable via a simple one-line code change. The efficacy of our method is empirically demonstrated with experiments on ImageNet (masked discrete diffusion) and QM9 (uniform discrete diffusion).</p></details> |  |

The key insight that enabled their development was the realization that access to the score -- the gradient of the log-density at different noise levels -- allows for sampling from data distributions by solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) via forward discretization, and that popular denoisers allow for unbiased estimators of this score. In this paper, we demonstrate that an alternative, backward discretization of these SDEs, using proximal maps in place of the score, leads to theoretical and practical benefits. We leverage recent results in proximal matching to learn proximal operators of the log-density and, with them, develop Proximal Diffusion Models (ProxDM). Theoretically, we prove that $\widetilde{O}(d/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps suffice for the resulting discretization to generate an $\varepsilon$-accurate distribution w.r.t. the KL divergence. Empirically, we show that two variants of ProxDM achieve significantly faster convergence within just a few sampling steps compared to conventional score-matching methods.</p></details> |  |

As its core, we introduce a unified transformer-diffusion framework, featuring an autoregressive transformer model that synthesize extended and music-synchronized token sequences for 2D body, head and hands poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human motion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment with musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this, we first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human pose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large articulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained motions (e.g., head and hands). We then design a music-to-motion transformer model that autoregressively generates music-aligned dance pose token sequences, incorporating global attention to both musical style and prior motion context. Finally we leverage a diffusion backbone to animate the reference image with these synthesized pose tokens through AdaIN, forming a fully differentiable end-to-end framework. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Dancer is able to produce both diverse and characterized dance videos, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods in term of diversity, expressiveness and realism.

Despite progress, three key limitations persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3) Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene composition with unprecedented controllability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hkdsc.github.io/project/copart</p></details> |

Computational approaches for predicting novel materials must effectively learn the manifold of stable crystal structures within an infinite design space. We introduce Open Materials Generation (OMatG), a unifying framework for the generative design and discovery of inorganic crystalline materials. OMatG employs stochastic interpolants (SI) to bridge an arbitrary base distribution to the target distribution of inorganic crystals via a broad class of tunable stochastic processes, encompassing both diffusion models and flow matching as special cases. In this work, we adapt the SI framework by integrating an equivariant graph representation of crystal structures and extending it to account for periodic boundary conditions in unit cell representations. Additionally, we couple the SI flow over spatial coordinates and lattice vectors with discrete flow matching for atomic species. We benchmark OMatG's performance on two tasks: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) for specified compositions, and 'de novo' generation (DNG) aimed at discovering stable, novel, and unique structures. In our ground-up implementation of OMatG, we refine and extend both CSP and DNG metrics compared to previous works. OMatG establishes a new state of the art in generative modeling for materials discovery, outperforming purely flow-based and diffusion-based implementations. These results underscore the importance of designing flexible deep learning frameworks to accelerate progress in materials science.

Despite proliferating research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features, and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised, statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation, thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels. Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the lack of visible light at night, it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we developed a high-precision visible light reflectance generative model, called Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m}, 0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance generation at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90, with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime generation capability was validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial progress in the ability to generate visible light reflectance at night, with the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title corrected (Lightning to Lighting); terminology updated (retrieval to generative)</p></details> |

This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of deep learning advances in remote sensing STF over the past decade. We establish a systematic taxonomy of deep learning architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and sequence models, revealing significant growth in deep learning adoption for STF tasks. Our analysis reveals that CNN-based methods dominate spatial feature extraction, while Transformer architectures show superior performance in capturing long-range temporal dependencies. GAN and diffusion models demonstrate exceptional capability in detail reconstruction, substantially outperforming traditional methods in structural similarity and spectral fidelity. Through comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets comparing ten representative methods, we validate these findings and quantify the performance trade-offs between different approaches. We identify five critical challenges: time-space conflicts, limited generalization across datasets, computational efficiency for large-scale processing, multi-source heterogeneous fusion, and insufficient benchmark diversity.

Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. To tackle this challenge, we propose FreeScale, a tuning-free inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation via scale fusion. Specifically, FreeScale processes information from different receptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.

However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.</p></details> |  |

However, inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations, particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in accuracy under varying compute budgets.</p></details> |  |

Low-light enhancement improves image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding, constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding, which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF). Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential.

Unlike existing methods, our approach is unsupervised, requires no paired training data, and is applicable to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of tasks, including image restoration, manifold signal reconstruction, and climate data imputation. APS significantly outperforms existing approaches in computational efficiency while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, enabling real-time, high-quality solutions to inverse problems across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models (image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure under $1,000 USD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://lambert-x.github.io/Vision-Language-Vision/</p></details> |

Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |

They are a critical tool in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models -- which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project website https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/.</p></details> |  |

Our diffusion model takes in mock SZ and X-ray images as conditional inputs, and generates realizations of corresponding gas and dark matter maps by sampling from a learned data posterior. We train and validate the performance of our model by using mock data from a cosmological simulation. The model accurately reconstructs both the mean and spread of the radial density profiles in the spatial domain, indicating that the model is able to distinguish between clusters of different mass sizes. In the spectral domain, the model achieves close-to-unity values for the bias and cross-correlation coefficients, indicating that the model can accurately probe cluster structures on both large and small scales. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of score models to learn a strong, nonlinear, and unbiased mapping between input observables and fundamental density distributions of galaxy clusters. These diffusion models can be further fine-tuned and generalized to not only take in additional observables as inputs, but also real observations and predict unknown density distributions of galaxy clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Open Journal of Astrophysics</p></details> |

We show that these adaptive mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis.

Radar and mesonet networks provide kilometer-scale precipitation fields, but with limited historical records and geographical coverage. Conversely, global gauge and blended products span decades, yet their coarse 30-50 km grids obscure local extremes. This work introduces Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a generative downscaling framework that integrates diffusion modeling with a distribution-matching (Wasserstein) regularizer, suppressing bias throughout the entire generative denoising process. Conditioned on 55 km CPC gauge-based precipitation and the 31 km ERA5 reanalysis, WassDiff generates 1 km precipitation estimates that remain well-calibrated to targets across the full intensity range, including the extremes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art downscaling methods, delivering lower reconstruction error and reduced bias. Case studies further demonstrate its ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale structures and accurate peak intensities from extreme weather phenomena, such as tropical storms and cold fronts. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Despite our computational limitations and time constraints, this work provides evidence of the flexibility and potential of the model as a general-purpose solver for fluid dynamics.

However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods.

Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages.

We show that the approximations produced by existing methods are relatively poor, especially early in the reverse process, and so we propose a new approach that iteratively reestimates and "renoises" the estimate several times per diffusion step. This iterative approach, which we call Fast Iterative REnoising (FIRE), injects colored noise that is shaped to ensure that the pre-trained diffusion model always sees white noise, in accordance with how it was trained. We then embed FIRE into the DDIM reverse process and show that the resulting "DDfire" offers state-of-the-art accuracy and runtime on several linear inverse problems, as well as phase retrieval.

While CoT improves both interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning, highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations. Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the frontier of LLM cognition.

We propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a "Re-Bottleneck", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE MLSP 2025</p></details> |

Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning with augmented data.

In particular the derivations use the fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian. \bigskip The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well. Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.</p></details> |  |

Standard diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT, and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference, the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory, allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain, effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and 10% gain in SSIM.</p></details> |  |

Our multi-view hair transfer model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view hair transfer.

However, manually writing high-quality SVAs remains labor-intensive and error-prone. To bridge this gap, we propose AssertCoder, a novel unified framework that automatically generates high-quality SVAs directly from multimodal hardware design specifications. AssertCoder employs a modality-sensitive preprocessing to parse heterogeneous specification formats (text, tables, diagrams, and formulas), followed by a set of dedicated semantic analyzers that extract structured representations aligned with signal-level semantics. These representations are utilized to drive assertion synthesis via multi-step chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. The framework incorporates a mutation-based evaluation approach to assess assertion quality via model checking and further refine the generated assertions. Experimental evaluation across three real-world Register-Transfer Level (RTL) designs demonstrates AssertCoder's superior performance, achieving an average increase of 8.4% in functional correctness and 5.8% in mutation detection compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

In particular, tasks that require detailed understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy, human-centric multimodal AI systems.

Existing methods attribute this problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL) framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed DGL.

| **[Improving Multimodal Learning via Imbalanced Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10203v1)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.10203v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error, ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARL.

However, these additional components -- combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads -- introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency and poor resource utilization. To address this, we propose Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2x and achieving 3.2-4.5x higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs).</p></details> |  |

CoSMo, developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS macro-structure, yet demonstrate multimodal benefits in resolving challenging ambiguities. CoSMo establishes a new state-of-the-art, paving the way for scalable comic book analysis.</p></details> |  |

This capability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured without direct interaction or visibility. Moreover, compared to images and text, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can be exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in understanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the lack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2) the limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from audio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark dataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world data, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we propose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary strengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in inferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the ALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in generating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts significantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive attributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense strategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling. Our work validates the feasibility of audio-based privacy attacks using MLLMs, highlighting the need for robust defenses, and provides a dataset and framework to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

Recent studies have attempted to integrate them via multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs) to further enhance recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically freeze the MKG structure during training, which limits the full integration of structural information from heterogeneous graphs (e.g., KG and user-item interaction graph), and results in sub-optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, termed Self-loop Iterative Fusion of Heterogeneous Auxiliary Information for Multimodal Recommendation (SLIF-MR), which leverages item representations from previous training epoch as feedback signals to dynamically optimize the heterogeneous graph structures composed of KG, multimodal item feature graph, and user-item interaction graph. Through this iterative fusion mechanism, both user and item representations are refined, thus improving the final recommendation performance. Specifically, based on the feedback item representations, SLIF-MR constructs an item-item correlation graph, then integrated into the establishment process of heterogeneous graphs as additional new structural information in a self-loop manner. Consequently, the internal structures of heterogeneous graphs are updated with the feedback item representations during training. Moreover, a semantic consistency learning strategy is proposed to align heterogeneous item representations across modalities. The experimental results show that SLIF-MR significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 10 pages,7 figures |

Two-stage methods that rely primarily on layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering, which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a new solution for graphic design.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Our objective is to optimize for a set of high-quality data samples that cover a highly diverse and rich set of multimodal tasks, while enabling cost-effective and accurate model evaluation. In particular, we collected 505 realistic tasks encompassing over 8,000 samples from 16 expert annotators to extensively cover the multimodal task space. Instead of unifying these problems into standard multi-choice questions (like MMMU, MMBench, and MMT-Bench), we embrace a wide range of output formats like numbers, phrases, code, \LaTeX, coordinates, JSON, free-form, etc. To accommodate these formats, we developed over 40 metrics to evaluate these tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks, MEGA-Bench offers a fine-grained capability report across multiple dimensions (e.g., application, input type, output format, skill), allowing users to interact with and visualize model capabilities in depth. We evaluate a wide variety of frontier vision-language models on MEGA-Bench to understand their capabilities across these dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera-ready version.

In this paper, we introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges.

While AI-driven decoding of neural data has provided insights into the human visual system, integrating multimodal neuroimaging signals, such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI, remains a critical hurdle due to their inherent spatiotemporal misalignment. Current approaches often analyze these modalities in isolation, limiting a holistic view of neural representation. In this study, we introduce BrainFLORA, a unified framework for integrating cross-modal neuroimaging data to construct a shared neural representation. Our approach leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) augmented with modality-specific adapters and task decoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance in joint-subject visual retrieval task and has the potential to extend multitasking. Combining neuroimaging analysis methods, we further reveal how visual concept representations align across neural modalities and with real world object perception. We demonstrate that the brain's structured visual concept representations exhibit an implicit mapping to physical-world stimuli, bridging neuroscience and machine learning from different modalities of neural imaging. Beyond methodological advancements, BrainFLORA offers novel implications for cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

However, its design and optimizations remain tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation, external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages visually grounded reasoning.

Therefore, we propose a novel Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network (KEN). On the one hand, we effectively leverage LVLM's powerful semantic understanding and extensive world knowledge. For images, the generated captions provide a comprehensive understanding of image content and scenes, while for text, the retrieved evidence helps break the information silos caused by the closed and limited text and context. On the other hand, we consider inter-class differences between different emotional types of news through balanced learning, achieving fine-grained modeling of the relationship between emotional types and authenticity.

Existing methods typically treat them separately, struggling with limited high-quality data and poor generalization. However, both tasks require capturing complex visual variations while maintaining consistency between inputs and outputs. Inspired by this, we propose MIGE, a unified framework that standardizes task representations using multimodal instructions. It first treats subject-driven generation as creation on a blank canvas and instruction-based editing as modification of an existing image, establishing a shared input-output formulation, then introduces a novel multimodal encoder that maps free-form multimodal instructions into a unified vision-language space, integrating visual and semantic features through a feature fusion mechanism. This unification enables joint training of both tasks, providing two key advantages: (1) Cross-Task Enhancement: by leveraging shared visual and semantic representations, joint training improves instruction adherence and visual consistency in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing. (2) Generalization: learning in a unified format facilitates cross-task knowledge transfer, enabling MIGE to generalize to novel compositional tasks, including instruction-based subject-driven editing. Experiments show that MIGE excels in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing while setting a SOTA in the new task of instruction-based subject-driven editing.

These robots must perceive complex and dynamic surroundings, understand tasks, and execute context-appropriate actions. However, current systems rely on proprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software, resulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale across platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to enable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized representations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as KGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast, multimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as images and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and knowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that combines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the structured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of supporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates ontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent manner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data, ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), using different modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and effectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and perform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance. Results show that GPT-o1 and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform other models. However, our findings also indicate that newer models do not guarantee better results, highlighting the critical role of the integration strategy in generating ontology-compliant KGs.</p></details> |  |

MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability. Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark, outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt following.

Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable multimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in the same encoding space, enabling it to be naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.</p></details> | 13 pages. 7 figures |

To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, to enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production pipeline.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

Beyond this earlier language-centric approach, Multimodal Financial Foundation Models (MFFMs) can digest interleaved multimodal financial data, including fundamental data, market data, data analytics, macroeconomic, and alternative data (e.g., natural language, audio, images, and video). In this position paper, presented at the MFFM Workshop joined with ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF) 2024, we describe the progress, prospects, and challenges of MFFMs. This paper also highlights ongoing research on FinAgents in the \textbf{SecureFinAI Lab}\footnote{\https://openfin.engineering.columbia.edu/} at Columbia University. We believe that MFFMs will enable a deeper understanding of the underlying complexity associated with numerous financial tasks and data, streamlining the operation of financial services and investment processes.

We introduce RAMA, a novel retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries; (2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification, paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods and datasets focus exclusively on English. Despite Indonesian being one of the most widely spoken languages, multimodal research in Indonesian remains under-explored, largely due to the lack of benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first public Indonesian video-text dataset by translating the English captions in the MSVD dataset into Indonesian. Using this dataset, we evaluate neural network models which were developed for the English video-text dataset on three tasks, i.e., text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. Most existing models rely on feature extractors pretrained on English vision-language datasets, raising concerns about their applicability to Indonesian, given the scarcity of large-scale pretraining resources in the language. We apply a cross-lingual transfer learning approach by leveraging English-pretrained extractors and fine-tuning models on our Indonesian dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across all tasks and metrics. We release our dataset publicly to support future research and hope it will inspire further progress in Indonesian multimodal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, translating high-level attack patterns described in Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) intelligence into actionable security policies remains a significant challenge. This challenge arises from the semantic gap between high-level threat intelligence and low-level provenance log. To address this issue, this paper introduces CLIProv, a novel approach for detecting threat behaviors in a host system. CLIProv employs a multimodal framework that leverages contrastive learning to align the semantics of provenance logs with threat intelligence, effectively correlating system intrusion activities with attack patterns. Furthermore, CLIProv formulates threat detection as a semantic search problem, identifying attack behaviors by searching for threat intelligence that is most semantically similar to the log sequence. By leveraging attack pattern information in threat intelligence, CLIProv identifies TTPs and generates complete and concise attack scenarios. Experimental evaluations on standard datasets show that CLIProv effectively identifies attack behaviors in system provenance logs, offering valuable references for potential techniques. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIProv achieves higher precision and significantly improved detection efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, extracting actionable insights from these vast and heterogeneous datasets remains a key challenge. The rise of foundation models (FMs) -- large deep-learning models pretrained on extensive amounts of data serving as a backbone for a wide range of downstream tasks -- offers new avenues for discovering biomarkers, improving diagnosis, and personalizing treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of widely adopted integration strategies of multimodal data to assist advance the computational approaches for data-driven discoveries in oncology. We examine emerging trends in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including methodological frameworks, validation protocols, and open-source resources targeting cancer subtype classification, biomarker discovery, treatment guidance, and outcome prediction. This study also comprehensively covers the shift from traditional ML to FMs for multimodal integration. We present a holistic view of recent FMs advancements and challenges faced during the integration of multi-omics with advanced imaging data. We identify the state-of-the-art FMs, publicly available multi-modal repositories, and advanced tools and methods for data integration. We argue that current state-of-the-art integrative methods provide the essential groundwork for developing the next generation of large-scale, pre-trained models poised to further revolutionize oncology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically map the transition from conventional ML to advanced FM for multimodal data integration in oncology, while also framing these developments as foundational for the forthcoming era of large-scale AI models in cancer research.</p></details> | 6 figures, 3 tables |

To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation, allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.</p></details> | Preprint |

This single-engine multimodal data twin platform reconstructs the ray-tracing computation of Sionna within Unreal Engine and is deeply integrated with autonomous driving tools. This enables efficient and synchronized simulation of multimodal data, including CSI, RGB, Radar, and LiDAR. Based on this platform, we construct an open-source, large-scale, low-altitude UAV multimodal synaesthesia dataset named Great-MSD, and propose a baseline CSI-based UAV 3D localization algorithm, demonstrating its feasibility and generalizability across different CSI simulation engines.

ByDeWay uses a novel prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.</p></details> |  |

This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified, user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://weihaotan.github.io/StarDojo</p></details> |

In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost.

This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs). Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings, and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | Accepted by ITSC'25 |

MM-Gesture is a multimodal fusion framework designed specifically for recognizing subtle and short-duration micro-gestures (MGs), integrating complementary cues from joint, limb, RGB video, Taylor-series video, optical-flow video, and depth video modalities. Utilizing PoseConv3D and Video Swin Transformer architectures with a novel modality-weighted ensemble strategy, our method further enhances RGB modality performance through transfer learning pre-trained on the larger MA-52 dataset. Extensive experiments on the iMiGUE benchmark, including ablation studies across different modalities, validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 73.213%.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios, despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space. Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer multimodal prognosis.

However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area. Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, published at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at BEAM with CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data combinatorially.

We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models.

The success of AVs depends on their ability to interpret complex, dynamic environments through diverse data sources, including video streams, sensor measurements, and contextual textual information. However, seamlessly integrating these multimodal inputs and ensuring transparency in AI-driven decisions remain formidable challenges. This study introduces a novel multimodal framework that synergistically combines video, sensor, and textual data to predict driving actions while generating human-readable explanations, fostering trust and regulatory compliance. By leveraging VideoMAE for spatiotemporal video analysis, a custom sensor fusion module for real-time data processing, and BERT for textual comprehension, our approach achieves robust decision-making and interpretable outputs. Evaluated on the BDD-X (21113 samples) and nuScenes (1000 scenes) datasets, our model reduces training loss from 5.7231 to 0.0187 over five epochs, attaining an action prediction accuracy of 92.5% and a BLEU-4 score of 0.75 for explanation quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of each modality, while qualitative analyses and human evaluations highlight the model's ability to produce contextually rich, user-friendly explanations. These advancements underscore the transformative potential of multimodal integration and explainability in building safe, transparent, and trustworthy AV systems, paving the way for broader societal adoption of autonomous driving technologies.</p></details> |  |

Traditional prognostic models, which rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics, often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data, including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA, and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used. These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling inference even when certain modalities are missing.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often rely on a single data modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables, four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space, enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable, data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a specific event, using both tabular and image data.</p></details> | 29 pages, 9 Figures |

M4Doc aligns an image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while benefiting from its multimodal knowledge.

These multigranular annotations encompass both global information, such as modality and organ detection, and local information like ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. Unlike the existing multimodal datasets, which are limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and textual annotations in the form of image-ROI-description triplets without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 30 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular textual descriptions. Compared to existing datasets, MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations, supporting a comprehensive range of multimodal tasks such as captioning and report generation, as well as vision-centric tasks like classification and segmentation. We propose LLaVA-Tri by pretraining LLaVA on MedTrinity-25M, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA, surpassing representative SOTA multimodal large language models. Furthermore, MedTrinity-25M can also be utilized to support large-scale pre-training of multimodal medical AI models, contributing to the development of future foundation models in the medical domain.

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work, we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector (GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical reasoning and science problem-solving.

As a result, they fail to capture the full breadth of gene functions and interactions across diverse biological contexts. In this study, we have systematically evaluated knowledge representations of biomolecules across multiple dimensions representing a task-agnostic manner spanning three major data sources, including omics experimental data, literature-derived text data, and knowledge graph-based representations. To distinguish between meaningful biological signals from chance correlations, we devised an adjusted variant of Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) that quantifies signal redundancy and complementarity across different data modalities and sources. These analyses reveal that existing embeddings capture largely non-overlapping molecular signals, highlighting the value of embedding integration. Building on this insight, we propose Platform for Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings (PRISME), a machine learning based workflow using an autoencoder to integrate these heterogeneous embeddings into a unified multimodal representation. We validated this approach across various benchmark tasks, where PRISME demonstrated consistent performance, and outperformed individual embedding methods in missing value imputations. This new framework supports comprehensive modeling of biomolecules, advancing the development of robust, broadly applicable multimodal embeddings optimized for downstream biomedical machine learning applications.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge, enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28% improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently, contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs.

However, a key limitation is the use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding, particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional reasoning.

However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored. Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories, macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs (four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought, Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona. Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs for improved nutrition analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.</p></details> | Work in progress |

This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Our research reveals that the matching capabilities in recent MLLMs still exhibit systematic shortcomings, even with current strong MLLMs models, GPT-4o. In particular, we construct a Multimodal Visual Matching (MMVM) benchmark to fairly benchmark over 30 different MLLMs. The MMVM benchmark is built from 15 open-source datasets and Internet videos with manual annotation. We categorize the data samples of MMVM benchmark into eight aspects based on the required cues and capabilities to more comprehensively evaluate and analyze current MLLMs. In addition, we have designed an automatic annotation pipeline to generate the MMVM SFT dataset, including 220K visual matching data with reasoning annotation.

However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved.

To overcome these limitations, we propose UniF$^2$ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train UniF$^2$ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, UniF$^2$ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on UniF$^2$ace-130K demonstrate that UniF$^2$ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present PAST, a pan-cancer single-cell foundation model trained on 20 million paired histopathology images and single-cell transcriptomes spanning multiple tumor types and tissue contexts. By jointly encoding cellular morphology and gene expression, PAST learns unified cross-modal representations that capture both spatial and molecular heterogeneity at the cellular level. This approach enables accurate prediction of single-cell gene expression, virtual molecular staining, and multimodal survival analysis directly from routine pathology slides. Across diverse cancers and downstream tasks, PAST consistently exceeds the performance of existing approaches, demonstrating robust generalizability and scalability. Our work establishes a new paradigm for pathology foundation models, providing a versatile tool for high-resolution spatial omics, mechanistic discovery, and precision cancer research.</p></details> |  |

Split Learning (SL), which partitions models at a designated cut-layer to offload compute-intensive operations to the server, offers a promising approach for distributed training of multimodal transformers, though its application remains underexplored. We present MPSL, a parallel SL approach for computational efficient fine-tuning of multimodal transformers in a distributed manner, while eliminating label sharing, client synchronization, and per-client sub-model management. MPSL employs lightweight client-side tokenizers and a unified modality-agnostic encoder, allowing flexible adaptation to task-specific needs. Our evaluation across 7 multimodal datasets demonstrates that MPSL matches or outperforms Federated Learning, reduces client-side computations by 250x, and achieves superior scalability in communication cost with model growth. Through extensive analysis, we highlight task suitability, trade-offs, and scenarios where MPSL excels, inspiring further exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, accepted to FedGenAI-IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods often tend to dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM) that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions. Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for autonomous driving applications.

However, CBCT images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT (sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality, outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings. Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CAIP 2025. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2506.08716</p></details> |

To control their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative, inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second, the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and three continual learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025. 10 pages, 6 figures.

Despite this, few approaches exist in the literature for this problem, with most not adequately taking into account the multimodality of the data. In this study, we developed multiple configurations of a novel multimodal and longitudinal learning framework, Longitudinal Ensemble Integration (LEI), for sequential classification. We evaluated LEI's performance, and compared it against existing approaches, for the early detection of dementia, which is among the most studied multimodal sequential classification tasks. LEI outperformed these approaches due to its use of intermediate base predictions arising from the individual data modalities, which enabled their better integration over time. LEI's design also enabled the identification of features that were consistently important across time for the effective prediction of dementia-related diagnoses. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of LEI for sequential classification from longitudinal multimodal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICDH 2025.

However, sensor synchronization challenges often compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where shortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on tracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly, under such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance degradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to effectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker should dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates. This is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion mechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy that ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is critical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts to varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks, excelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings. The code and benchmark will be publicly available at https://github.com/supertyd/FlexTrack/tree/main.</p></details> | ICCV2025 accepted |

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

However, these datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or depth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate such variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures, 9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels. For three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire 101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our dataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater performance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance comparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data quantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is effective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even greater improvements. SenseShift6D extends the 6D-pose evaluation paradigm from data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive, self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain real-world environments.

Existing codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a 500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics. This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

However, this paper reveals that ID features are effective but have limited benefits in multimodal collaborative filtering recommendation. Therefore, this paper systematically deconstruct the pros and cons of ID features: (i) they provide initial embedding but lack semantic richness, (ii) they provide a unique identifier for each user and item but hinder generalization to untrained data, and (iii) they assist in aligning and fusing multimodal features but may lead to representation shift. Based on these insights, this paper proposes IDFREE, an ID-free multimodal collaborative Filtering REcommEndation baseline. IDFREE replaces ID features with multimodal features and positional encodings to generate semantically meaningful ID-free embeddings. For ID-free multimodal collaborative filtering, it further proposes an adaptive similarity graph module to construct dynamic user-user and item-item graphs based on multimodal features. Then, an augmented user-item graph encoder is proposed to construct more effective user and item encoding. Finally, IDFREE achieves inter-multimodal alignment based on the contrastive learning and uses Softmax loss as recommendation loss. Basic experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that IDFREE outperforms existing ID-based MCFRec methods, achieving an average performance gain of 72.24% across standard metrics (Recall@5, 10, 20, 50 and NDCG@5, 10, 20, 50). Exploratory and extended experiments further validate our findings on the limitations of ID features in MCFRec.

BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs' knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that (i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap. Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can offer insights and contributions to the community.</p></details> | Preprint |

To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension.

Previous studies often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former). Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2) introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.

Recent studies have concentrated on classifying cardiac conditions using ECG data but have overlooked ECG report generation, which is time-consuming and requires clinical expertise. To automate ECG report generation and ensure its versatility, we propose the Multimodal ECG Instruction Tuning (MEIT) framework, the first attempt to tackle ECG report generation with LLMs and multimodal instructions. To facilitate future research, we establish a benchmark to evaluate MEIT with various LLMs backbones across two large-scale ECG datasets. Our approach uniquely aligns the representations of the ECG signal and the report, and we conduct extensive experiments to benchmark MEIT with nine open-source LLMs using more than 800,000 ECG reports. MEIT's results underscore the superior performance of instruction-tuned LLMs, showcasing their proficiency in quality report generation, zero-shot capabilities, resilience to signal perturbation, and alignment with human expert evaluation. These findings emphasize the efficacy of MEIT and its potential for real-world clinical application.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Reliable infarct prediction informs key clinical interventions, including the need for patient transfer to comprehensive stroke centers, the potential benefit of additional reperfusion attempts during mechanical thrombectomy, decisions regarding secondary neuroprotective treatments, and ultimately, prognosis of clinical outcomes. This work introduces the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) 2024 challenge, which focuses on the prediction of final infarct volumes from pre-interventional acute stroke imaging and clinical data. ISLES24 provides a comprehensive, multimodal setting where participants can leverage all clinically and practically available data, including full acute CT imaging, sub-acute follow-up MRI, and structured clinical information, across a train set of 150 cases. On the hidden test set of 98 cases, the top-performing model, a multimodal nnU-Net-based architecture, achieved a Dice score of 0.285 (+/- 0.213) and an absolute volume difference of 21.2 (+/- 37.2) mL, underlining the significant challenges posed by this task and the need for further advances in multimodal learning. This work makes two primary contributions: first, we establish a standardized, clinically realistic benchmark for post-treatment infarct prediction, enabling systematic evaluation of multimodal algorithmic strategies on a longitudinal stroke dataset; second, we analyze current methodological limitations and outline key research directions to guide the development of next-generation infarct prediction models.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose KAN-MCP, a novel framework that integrates the interpretability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with the robustness of the Multimodal Clean Pareto (MCPareto) framework. First, KAN leverages its univariate function decomposition to achieve transparent analysis of cross-modal interactions. This structural design allows direct inspection of feature transformations without relying on external interpretation tools, thereby ensuring both high expressiveness and interpretability. Second, the proposed MCPareto enhances robustness by addressing modality imbalance and noise interference. Specifically, we introduce the Dimensionality Reduction and Denoising Modal Information Bottleneck (DRD-MIB) method, which jointly denoises and reduces feature dimensionality. This approach provides KAN with discriminative low-dimensional inputs to reduce the modeling complexity of KAN while preserving critical sentiment-related information. Furthermore, MCPareto dynamically balances gradient contributions across modalities using the purified features output by DRD-MIB, ensuring lossless transmission of auxiliary signals and effectively alleviating modality imbalance. This synergy of interpretability and robustness not only achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets such as CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS v2 but also offers an intuitive visualization interface through KAN's interpretable architecture.

In particular, users can post a stream of multimodal data that can be critical for real-time humanitarian response. However, effectively extracting meaningful information from this large and noisy data stream and effectively integrating heterogeneous data remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we explore vision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the classification of crisis data in three different tasks. We incorporate LLaVA-generated text to improve text-image alignment. Additionally, we leverage Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings, which, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models. To further refine multimodal fusion, we employ Guided Cross Attention (Guided CA) and combine it with the Differential Attention mechanism to enhance feature alignment by emphasizing critical information while filtering out irrelevant content. Our results show that while Differential Attention improves classification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning multimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set demonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual descriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more reliable and interpretable models for three different tasks that are crucial for disaster response.

Evaluation often relies on automatic speech recognition, which may introduce bias. We propose SVLA, a unified speech vision language model based on a transformer architecture that handles multimodal inputs and outputs. We train it on 38.2 million speech text image examples, including 64.1 hours of synthetic speech. We also introduce Speech VQA Accuracy, a new metric for evaluating spoken responses.

We validate this approach by comprehensively evaluating it against knowledge tracing benchmarks in five domains.

We adopt parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on the pretrained text-to-music generation model, enabling fine-grained adaptation to the multimodal controls using a small dataset. To ensure precise synchronization between video and music, we introduce a temporal smoothing strategy to align multiple modalities. Experiments demonstrate that integrating visual features alongside textual descriptions enhances the overall quality of generated music in terms of musicality, creativity, beat-tempo consistency, temporal alignment with the video, and text adherence, surpassing both proposed baselines and existing state-of-the-art video-to-music generation models. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of 7 hours of synchronized video recordings capturing expressive facial and upper-body gestures aligned with corresponding music, providing significant potential for future research in multimodal and interactive music generation.</p></details> |  |

These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our source code and data in the camera-ready version.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,6 figures,5 tables</p></details> |

Current methods often employ straightforward fusion strategies for multimodal feature integration, failing to comprehensively capture modality-specific and modality-common interactions, resulting in a limited understanding of multimodal correlations and suboptimal predictive performance. To mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal Representation Decoupling Network (MurreNet) to advance cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first propose a Multimodal Representation Decomposition (MRD) module to explicitly decompose paired input data into modality-specific and modality-shared representations, thereby reducing redundancy between modalities. Furthermore, the disentangled representations are further refined then updated through a novel training regularization strategy that imposes constraints on distributional similarity, difference, and representativeness of modality features. Finally, the augmented multimodal features are integrated into a joint representation via proposed Deep Holistic Orthogonal Fusion (DHOF) strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on six TCGA cancer cohorts demonstrate that our MurreNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in survival prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods address structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However, this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student" prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion. Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further enhancing the generalization capabilities.

In this work, we propose ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal diffusion model. Given pre-event images and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts, instance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event images. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image diffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal controls, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion, directly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event states. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal generative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that ChangeBridge can simulate high-fidelity future scenarios aligned with given conditions, including event and event-driven background variations.

| **[PhotIQA: A photoacoustic image data set with image quality ratings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03478v1)** | 2025-07-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.03478v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is crucial in the evaluation stage of novel algorithms operating on images, including traditional and machine learning based methods. Due to the lack of available quality-rated medical images, most commonly used IQA methods employing reference images (i.e. full-reference IQA) have been developed and tested for natural images. Reported application inconsistencies arising when employing such measures for medical images are not surprising, as they rely on different properties than natural images. In photoacoustic imaging (PAI), especially, standard benchmarking approaches for assessing the quality of image reconstructions are lacking. PAI is a multi-physics imaging modality, in which two inverse problems have to be solved, which makes the application of IQA measures uniquely challenging due to both, acoustic and optical, artifacts. To support the development and testing of full- and no-reference IQA measures we assembled PhotIQA, a data set consisting of 1134 reconstructed photoacoustic (PA) images that were rated by 2 experts across five quality properties (overall quality, edge visibility, homogeneity, inclusion and background intensity), where the detailed rating enables usage beyond PAI. To allow full-reference assessment, highly characterised imaging test objects were used, providing a ground truth. Our baseline experiments show that HaarPSI$_{med}$ significantly outperforms SSIM in correlating with the quality ratings (SRCC: 0.83 vs. 0.62). The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13325196.</p></details> | 12 pages |

No-reference image quality measures are often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and code are publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388429.</p></details> |  |
| **[Super-temporal-resolution Photoacoustic Imaging with Dynamic Reconstruction through Implicit Neural Representation in Sparse-view](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03175v1)** | 2025-05-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03175v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is an important imaging technique for monitoring physiological processes, capable of providing high-contrast images of optical absorption at much greater depths than traditional optical imaging methods. However, practical instrumentation and geometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the imaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data, produce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not consider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution is crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by the low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser technology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by characterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to improve dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and enhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input. Specifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as implicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the network are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the need for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong implicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit regularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms traditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions, effectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.</p></details> |  |

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Free-hand 3D Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Reconstruction using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03505v1)** | 2025-02-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.03505v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a motion-based learning network with a global-local self-attention module (MoGLo-Net) to enhance 3D reconstruction in handheld photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging. Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact: Self-incentive artifact removal for photoacoustic imaging without any data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14873v2)** | 2024-12-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.14873v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) uniquely combines optical contrast with the penetration depth of ultrasound, making it critical for clinical applications. However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction.

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data.

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods.

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint.

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |
| **[Tattoo tomography: Freehand 3D photoacoustic image reconstruction with an optical pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04997v2)** | 2020-11-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.04997v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a novel imaging technique that can spatially resolve both morphological and functional tissue properties, such as the vessel topology and tissue oxygenation. While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, extraction of relevant tissue parameters from the raw data requires the solving of inverse image reconstruction problems, which have proven extremely difficult to solve. The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem. In this review, we examine the current state of the art regarding deep learning in PAI and identify potential directions of research that will help to reach the goal of clinical applicability</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 169 references</p></details> |
