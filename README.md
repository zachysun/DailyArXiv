| **[Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546v2)** | 2025-03-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17546v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p></details> | 46 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Towards Reliable Time Series Forecasting under Future Uncertainty: Ambiguity and Novelty Rejection Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19656v1)** | 2025-03-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.19656v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world time series forecasting, uncertainty and lack of reliable evaluation pose significant challenges. Notably, forecasting errors often arise from underfitting in-distribution data and failing to handle out-of-distribution inputs. To enhance model reliability, we introduce a dual rejection mechanism combining ambiguity and novelty rejection. Ambiguity rejection, using prediction error variance, allows the model to abstain under low confidence, assessed through historical error variance analysis without future ground truth. Novelty rejection, employing Variational Autoencoders and Mahalanobis distance, detects deviations from training data. This dual approach improves forecasting reliability in dynamic environments by reducing errors and adapting to data changes, advancing reliability in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Classification of Time Series: Taxonomy and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18332v3)** | 2025-03-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.18332v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many situations, the measurements of a studied phenomenon are provided sequentially, and the prediction of its class needs to be made as early as possible so as not to incur too high a time penalty, but not too early and risk paying the cost of misclassification. This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm).</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Imperceptible Adversarial Attacks for Time Series Classification with Local Perturbations and Frequency Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19519v1)** | 2025-03-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.19519v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks in time series classification (TSC) models have recently gained attention due to their potential to compromise model robustness. Imperceptibility is crucial, as adversarial examples detected by the human vision system (HVS) can render attacks ineffective. Many existing methods fail to produce high-quality imperceptible examples, often generating perturbations with more perceptible low-frequency components, like square waves, and global perturbations that reduce stealthiness. This paper aims to improve the imperceptibility of adversarial attacks on TSC models by addressing frequency components and time series locality. We propose the Shapelet-based Frequency-domain Attack (SFAttack), which uses local perturbations focused on time series shapelets to enhance discriminative information and stealthiness. Additionally, we introduce a low-frequency constraint to confine perturbations to high-frequency components, enhancing imperceptibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[XXLTraffic: Expanding and Extremely Long Traffic forecasting beyond test adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12693v2)** | 2025-03-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.12693v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting is crucial for smart cities and intelligent transportation initiatives, where deep learning has made significant progress in modeling complex spatio-temporal patterns in recent years. However, current public datasets have limitations in reflecting the distribution shift nature of real-world scenarios, characterized by continuously evolving infrastructures, varying temporal distributions, and long temporal gaps due to sensor downtimes or changes in traffic patterns. These limitations inevitably restrict the practical applicability of existing traffic forecasting datasets. To bridge this gap, we present XXLTraffic, largest available public traffic dataset with the longest timespan collected from Los Angeles, USA, and New South Wales, Australia, curated to support research in extremely long forecasting beyond test adaptation. Our benchmark includes both typical time-series forecasting settings with hourly and daily aggregated data and novel configurations that introduce gaps and down-sample the training size to better simulate practical constraints. We anticipate the new XXLTraffic will provide a fresh perspective for the time-series and traffic forecasting communities. It would also offer a robust platform for developing and evaluating models designed to tackle the extremely long forecasting problems beyond test adaptation. Our dataset supplements existing spatio-temporal data resources and leads to new research directions in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrackRAD2025 challenge dataset: Real-time tumor tracking for MRI-guided radiotherapy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19119v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.19119v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize anatomical motion is becoming increasingly important when treating cancer patients with radiotherapy. Hybrid MRI-linear accelerator (MRI-linac) systems allow real-time motion management during irradiation. This paper presents a multi-institutional real-time MRI time series dataset from different MRI-linac vendors. The dataset is designed to support developing and evaluating real-time tumor localization (tracking) algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy within the TrackRAD2025 challenge (https://trackrad2025.grand-challenge.org/). Acquisition and validation methods: The dataset consists of sagittal 2D cine MRIs in 585 patients from six centers (3 Dutch, 1 German, 1 Australian, and 1 Chinese). Tumors in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis acquired on two commercially available MRI-linacs (0.35 T and 1.5 T) were included. For 108 cases, irradiation targets or tracking surrogates were manually segmented on each temporal frame. The dataset was randomly split into a public training set of 527 cases (477 unlabeled and 50 labeled) and a private testing set of 58 cases (all labeled). Data Format and Usage Notes: The data is publicly available under the TrackRAD2025 collection: https://doi.org/10.57967/hf/4539. Both the images and segmentations for each patient are available in metadata format. Potential Applications: This novel clinical dataset will enable the development and evaluation of real-time tumor localization algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy. By enabling more accurate motion management and adaptive treatment strategies, this dataset has the potential to advance the field of radiotherapy significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables; submitted to Medical Physics</p></details> |
| **[Entropic Analysis of Time Series through Kernel Density Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18916v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18916v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel framework for time series analysis using entropic measures based on the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the time series' Takens' embeddings. Using this framework we introduce two distinct analytical tools: (1) a multi-scale KDE entropy metric, denoted as $\Delta\text{KE}$, which quantifies the evolution of time series complexity across different scales by measuring certain entropy changes, and (2) a sliding baseline method that employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect changes in time series dynamics through changes in KDEs. The $\Delta{\rm KE}$ metric offers insights into the information content and ``unfolding'' properties of the time series' embedding related to dynamical systems, while the KL divergence-based approach provides a noise and outlier robust approach for identifying time series change points (injections in RF signals, e.g.). We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools through a set of experiments encompassing diverse domains. In the space of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, we achieve accurate detection of signal injections under varying noise and interference conditions. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to electrocardiography (ECG) data, successfully identifying instances of ventricular fibrillation with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our tools for dynamic state detection by accurately identifying chaotic regimes within an intermittent signal. These results show the broad applicability of our framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex time series data across various scientific disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiTEC-WDN: A Large-Scale Dataset of Hydraulic Scenarios across Multiple Water Distribution Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17167v2)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17167v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy restrictions hinder the sharing of real-world Water Distribution Network (WDN) models, limiting the application of emerging data-driven machine learning, which typically requires extensive observations. To address this challenge, we propose the dataset DiTEC-WDN that comprises 36,000 unique scenarios simulated over either short-term (24 hours) or long-term (1 year) periods. We constructed this dataset using an automated pipeline that optimizes crucial parameters (e.g., pressure, flow rate, and demand patterns), facilitates large-scale simulations, and records discrete, synthetic but hydraulically realistic states under standard conditions via rule validation and post-hoc analysis. With a total of 228 million generated graph-based states, DiTEC-WDN can support a variety of machine-learning tasks, including graph-level, node-level, and link-level regression, as well as time-series forecasting. This contribution, released under a public license, encourages open scientific research in the critical water sector, eliminates the risk of exposing sensitive data, and fulfills the need for a large-scale water distribution network benchmark for study comparisons and scenario analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nature Scientific Data.

| **[Adaptive Machine Learning for Resource-Constrained Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18634v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18634v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet of Things is an example domain where data is perpetually generated in ever-increasing quantities, reflecting the proliferation of connected devices and the formation of continuous data streams over time. Consequently, the demand for ad-hoc, cost-effective machine learning solutions must adapt to this evolving data influx. This study tackles the task of offloading in small gateways, exacerbated by their dynamic availability over time. An approach leveraging CPU utilization metrics using online and continual machine learning techniques is proposed to predict gateway availability. These methods are compared to popular machine learning algorithms and a recent time-series foundation model, Lag-Llama, for fine-tuned and zero-shot setups. Their performance is benchmarked on a dataset of CPU utilization measurements over time from an IoT gateway and focuses on model metrics such as prediction errors, training and inference times, and memory consumption. Our primary objective is to study new efficient ways to predict CPU performance in IoT environments. Across various scenarios, our findings highlight that ensemble and online methods offer promising results for this task in terms of accuracy while maintaining a low resource footprint.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, accepted at DELTA 2024 (Workshop on Discovering Drift Phenomena in Evolving Landscapes), co-located with ACM SIGKDD 2024.

| **[Survival Analysis with Machine Learning for Predicting Li-ion Battery Remaining Useful Life](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13558v3)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.13558v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate prediction of RUL for lithium-ion batteries is crucial for enhancing the reliability and longevity of energy storage systems. Traditional methods for RUL prediction often struggle with issues such as data sparsity, varying battery chemistries, and the inability to capture complex degradation patterns over time. In this study, we propose a survival analysis-based framework combined with deep learning models to predict the RUL of lithium-ion batteries. Specifically, we utilize five advanced models: the Cox-type models (Cox, CoxPH, and CoxTime) and two machine-learning-based models (DeepHit and MTLR). These models address the challenges of accurate RUL estimation by transforming raw time-series battery data into survival data, including key degradation indicators such as voltage, current, and internal resistance. Advanced feature extraction techniques enhance the model's robustness in diverse real-world scenarios, including varying charging conditions and battery chemistries. Our models are tested using 10-fold cross-validation, ensuring generalizability and minimizing overfitting. Experimental results show that our survival-based framework significantly improves RUL prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods, providing a reliable tool for battery management and maintenance optimization. This study contributes to the advancement of predictive maintenance in battery technology, offering valuable insights for both researchers and industry practitioners aiming to enhance the operational lifespan of lithium-ion batteries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Tensor PCA via Tensor Decomposition for Unsupervised Feature Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16985v2)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.16985v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, introducing Tensor Decomposition (TD) techniques into unsupervised feature selection (UFS) has been an emerging research topic. A tensor structure is beneficial for mining the relations between different modes and helps relieve the computation burden. However, while existing methods exploit TD to preserve the data tensor structure, they do not consider the influence of data orientation and thus have difficulty in handling orientation-specific data such as time series. To solve the above problem, we utilize the orientation-dependent tensor-tensor product from Tensor Singular Value Decomposition based on *M-product (T-SVDM) and extend the one-dimensional Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) to a tensor form. The proposed sparse tensor PCA model can constrain sparsity at the specified mode and yield sparse tensor principal components, enhancing flexibility and accuracy in learning feature relations. To ensure fast convergence and a flexible description of feature correlation, we develop a convex version specially designed for general UFS tasks and propose an efficient slice-by-slice algorithm that performs dual optimization in the transform domain. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and remarkable computational efficiency of the proposed method for tensor data of diverse structures over the state-of-the-arts. With a proper combination of data orientation and transform domain, our method is promising for various applications. The codes related to our proposed methods and the experiments are available at https://github.com/zjj20212035/STPCA.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoCA: Robust Contrastive One-class Time Series Anomaly Detection with Contaminated Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18385v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18385v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accumulation of time-series signals and the absence of labels make time-series Anomaly Detection (AD) a self-supervised task of deep learning. Methods based on normality assumptions face the following three limitations: (1) A single assumption could hardly characterize the whole normality or lead to some deviation. (2) Some assumptions may go against the principle of AD. (3) Their basic assumption is that the training data is uncontaminated (free of anomalies), which is unrealistic in practice, leading to a decline in robustness. This paper proposes a novel robust approach, RoCA, which is the first to address all of the above three challenges, as far as we are aware. It fuses the separated assumptions of one-class classification and contrastive learning in a single training process to characterize a more complete so-called normality. Additionally, it monitors the training data and computes a carefully designed anomaly score throughout the training process. This score helps identify latent anomalies, which are then used to define the classification boundary, inspired by the concept of outlier exposure. The performance on AIOps datasets improved by 6% compared to when contamination was not considered (COCA). On two large and high-dimensional multivariate datasets, the performance increased by 5% to 10%. RoCA achieves the highest average performance on both univariate and multivariate datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/ruiking04/RoCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[PS-EIP: Robust Photometric Stereo Based on Event Interval Profile](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18341v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18341v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the energy-efficient photometric stereo method using an event camera has been proposed to recover surface normals from events triggered by changes in logarithmic Lambertian reflections under a moving directional light source. However, EventPS treats each event interval independently, making it sensitive to noise, shadows, and non-Lambertian reflections. This paper proposes Photometric Stereo based on Event Interval Profile (PS-EIP), a robust method that recovers pixelwise surface normals from a time-series profile of event intervals. By exploiting the continuity of the profile and introducing an outlier detection method based on profile shape, our approach enhances robustness against outliers from shadows and specular reflections. Experiments using real event data from 3D-printed objects demonstrate that PS-EIP significantly improves robustness to outliers compared to EventPS's deep-learning variant, EventPS-FCN, without relying on deep learning.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |
| **[Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18309v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18309v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems, offering interpretable uncertainty quantification and inherent regularization. However, existing GPSSMs face significant challenges in handling high-dimensional, non-stationary systems due to computational inefficiencies, limited scalability, and restrictive stationarity assumptions. In this paper, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) to address these limitations. Our approach leverages a single shared Gaussian process (GP) combined with normalizing flows and Bayesian neural networks, enabling efficient modeling of complex, high-dimensional state transitions while preserving scalability. To address the lack of closed-form expressions for the implicit process in the transformed GP, we follow its generative process and introduce an efficient variational inference algorithm, aided by the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), to enable computationally tractable learning and inference. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Limits to Analog Reservoir Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14474v2)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2307.14474v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computation is a recurrent framework for learning and predicting time series data, that benefits from extremely simple training and interpretability, often as the the dynamics of a physical system. In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Tensor-based homogeneous polynomial dynamical system analysis from data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17774v1)** | 2025-03-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17774v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous complex real-world systems, such as those in biological, ecological, and social networks, exhibit higher-order interactions that are often modeled using polynomial dynamical systems or homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs). However, identifying system parameters and analyzing key system-theoretic properties remain challenging due to their inherent nonlinearity and complexity, particularly for large-scale systems. To address these challenges, we develop an innovative computational framework in this article that leverages advanced tensor decomposition techniques, namely tensor train and hierarchical Tucker decompositions, to facilitate efficient identification and analysis of HPDSs that can be equivalently represented by tensors. Specifically, we introduce memory-efficient system identification techniques for directly estimating system parameters represented through tensor decompositions from time-series data. Additionally, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for determining controllability and observability using the tensor decomposition-based representations of HPDSs, accompanied by detailed complexity analyses that demonstrate significant reductions in computational demands. The effectiveness and efficiency of our framework are validated through numerical examples.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures |

The research employs gradient boosting regression and Prophet time series forecasting to make predictions of future generation capacities for solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass, and other renewable sources in South American nations. Model output analysis indicates staggering future expansion in the generation of renewable energy, with solar and wind energy registering the highest expansion rates. Geospatial visualization methods were applied to illustrate regional disparities in the utilization of renewable energy. The results forecast South America to record nearly 3-fold growth in the generation of renewable energy by the year 2050, with Brazil and Chile spearheading regional development. Such projections help design energy policy, investment strategy, and climate change mitigation throughout the region, in helping the developing economies to transition to sustainable energy.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital.

Most of the state-of-the-art architectures exploit either temporal or inter-channel dependencies, limiting their effectiveness in multivariate time-series forecasting where both types of dependencies are crucial. We propose Sentinel, a full transformer-based architecture composed of an encoder able to extract contextual information from the channel dimension, and a decoder designed to capture causal relations and dependencies across the temporal dimension. Additionally, we introduce a multi-patch attention mechanism, which leverages the patching process to structure the input sequence in a way that can be naturally integrated into the transformer architecture, replacing the multi-head splitting process. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that Sentinel, because of its ability to "monitor" both the temporal and the inter-channel dimension, achieves better or comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Dynamic Trend Filtering through Trend Point Detection with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03665v2)** | 2025-03-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.03665v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trend filtering simplifies complex time series data by applying smoothness to filter out noise while emphasizing proximity to the original data. However, existing trend filtering methods fail to reflect abrupt changes in the trend due to `approximateness,' resulting in constant smoothness. This approximateness uniformly filters out the tail distribution of time series data, characterized by extreme values, including both abrupt changes and noise. In this paper, we propose Trend Point Detection formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), a novel approach to identifying essential points that should be reflected in the trend, departing from approximations. We term these essential points as Dynamic Trend Points (DTPs) and extract trends by interpolating them. To identify DTPs, we utilize Reinforcement Learning (RL) within a discrete action space and a forecasting sum-of-squares loss function as a reward, referred to as the Dynamic Trend Filtering network (DTF-net). DTF-net integrates flexible noise filtering, preserving critical original subsequences while removing noise as required for other subsequences. We demonstrate that DTF-net excels at capturing abrupt changes compared to other trend filtering algorithms and enhances forecasting performance, as abrupt changes are predicted rather than smoothed out.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

While RNNs suffer from vanishing gradients and sequential inefficiencies, and Transformers face quadratic complexity, SSMs leverage structured recurrence and state-space representations to achieve superior long-sequence processing with linear or near-linear complexity. This survey provides a comprehensive review of SSMs, tracing their evolution from the foundational S4 model to its successors like Mamba, Simplified Structured State Space Sequence Model (S5), and Jamba, highlighting their improvements in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and inference speed. By comparing SSMs with traditional sequence models across domains such as natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, vision, and time-series forecasting, we demonstrate their advantages in handling long-range dependencies while reducing computational overhead. Despite their potential, challenges remain in areas such as training optimization, hybrid modeling, and interpretability. This survey serves as a structured guide for researchers and practitioners, detailing the advancements, trade-offs, and future directions of SSM-based architectures in AI and deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[CausalRivers -- Scaling up benchmarking of causal discovery for real-world time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17452v1)** | 2025-03-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17452v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery, or identifying causal relationships from observational data, is a notoriously challenging task, with numerous methods proposed to tackle it. Despite this, in-the-wild evaluation of these methods is still lacking, as works frequently rely on synthetic data evaluation and sparse real-world examples under critical theoretical assumptions. Real-world causal structures, however, are often complex, making it hard to decide on a proper causal discovery strategy. To bridge this gap, we introduce CausalRivers, the largest in-the-wild causal discovery benchmarking kit for time-series data to date. CausalRivers features an extensive dataset on river discharge that covers the eastern German territory (666 measurement stations) and the state of Bavaria (494 measurement stations). It spans the years 2019 to 2023 with a 15-minute temporal resolution. Further, we provide additional data from a flood around the Elbe River, as an event with a pronounced distributional shift. Leveraging multiple sources of information and time-series meta-data, we constructed two distinct causal ground truth graphs (Bavaria and eastern Germany). These graphs can be sampled to generate thousands of subgraphs to benchmark causal discovery across diverse and challenging settings. To demonstrate the utility of CausalRivers, we evaluate several causal discovery approaches through a set of experiments to identify areas for improvement. CausalRivers has the potential to facilitate robust evaluations and comparisons of causal discovery methods. Besides this primary purpose, we also expect that this dataset will be relevant for connected areas of research, such as time-series forecasting and anomaly detection. Based on this, we hope to push benchmark-driven method development that fosters advanced techniques for causal discovery, as is the case for many other areas of machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, ICLR2025 main track</p></details> |

Yet, most neural architectures flatten inputs, discarding critical cross-dimension information. We introduce NdLinear, a novel linear transformation that preserves these structures without extra overhead. By operating separately along each dimension, NdLinear captures dependencies that standard fully connected layers overlook. Extensive experiments across convolutional, recurrent, and transformer-based networks show significant improvements in representational power and parameter efficiency. Crucially, NdLinear serves as a foundational building block for large-scale foundation models by operating on any unimodal or multimodal data in its native form. This removes the need for flattening or modality-specific preprocessing. Ndlinear rethinks core architectural priorities beyond attention, enabling more expressive, context-aware models at scale. We propose NdLinear as a drop-in replacement for standard linear layers -- marking an important step toward next-generation neural architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ensemble-core/NdLinear</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a modular, interpretable pipeline for pulse signal estimation from video of the face that achieves state-of-the-art results on publicly available datasets.Our imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) system consists of three modules: face and landmark detection, time-series extraction, and pulse signal/pulse rate estimation. Unlike many deep learning methods that make use of a single black-box model that maps directly from input video to output signal or heart rate, our modular approach enables each of the three parts of the pipeline to be interpreted individually. The pulse signal estimation module, which we call TURNIP (Time-Series U-Net with Recurrence for Noise-Robust Imaging Photoplethysmography), allows the system to faithfully reconstruct the underlying pulse signal waveform and uses it to measure heart rate and pulse rate variability metrics, even in the presence of motion. When parts of the face are occluded due to extreme head poses, our system explicitly detects such "self-occluded" regions and maintains estimation robustness despite the missing information. Our algorithm provides reliable heart rate estimates without the need for specialized sensors or contact with the skin, outperforming previous iPPG methods on both color (RGB) and near-infrared (NIR) datasets.</p></details> | 14 Pages, 8 figures |

However, heterogeneous data across diverse regions, driven by factors such as varying consumer behavior, poses challenges to the effectiveness of federated learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Privacy-Adaptive Clustered Federated Learning (PA-CFL) tailored for demand forecasting on heterogeneous retail data. By leveraging differential privacy and feature importance distribution, PA-CFL groups retailers into distinct ``bubbles'', each forming its own federated learning system to effectively isolate data heterogeneity. Within each bubble, Transformer models are designed to predict local sales for each client. Our experiments demonstrate that PA-CFL significantly surpasses FedAvg and outperforms local learning in demand forecasting performance across all participating clients. Compared to local learning, PA-CFL achieves a 5.4% improvement in R^2, a 69% reduction in RMSE, and a 45% decrease in MAE. Our approach enables effective FL through adaptive adjustments to diverse noise levels and the range of clients participating in each bubble. By grouping participants and proactively filtering out high-risk clients, PA-CFL mitigates potential threats to the FL system. The findings demonstrate PA-CFL's ability to enhance federated learning in time series prediction tasks with heterogeneous data, achieving a balance between forecasting accuracy and privacy preservation in retail applications. Additionally, PA-CFL's capability to detect and neutralize poisoned data from clients enhances the system's robustness and reliability.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes ATHENA, the first IVN intrusion detection framework that adopts a vehicle-cloud integrated architecture to achieve better security performance for the resource-constrained vehicular environment. Specifically, in the cloud with sufficient resources, ATHENA uses the clustering method of multi-distribution mixture model combined with deep data mining technology to generate the raw Payload Rule Bank of IVN CAN messages, and then improves the rule quality with the help of exploitation on the first-principled physical knowledge of the vehicle system, after which the payload rules are periodically sent to the vehicle terminal. At the vehicle terminal, a simple LSTM component is used to generate the Time Rule Bank representing the long-term time series dependencies and the periodic characteristics of CAN messages, but not for any detection tasks as in traditional usage scenarios, where only the generated time rules are the candidates for further IVN intrusion detection tasks. Based on both the payload and time rules generated from cloud and vehicle terminal, ATHENA can achieve efficient intrusion detection capability by simple rule-base matching operations, rather than using complex black-box reasoning of resource-intensive neural network models, which is in fact only used for rule logic generation phase instead of the actual intrusion detection phase in our framework. Comparative experimental results on the ROAD dataset, which is current the most outstanding real-world in-vehicle CAN dataset covering new instances of sophisticated and stealthy masquerade attacks, demonstrate ATHENA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art IVN intrusion detection methods in detecting complex attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Because causal ground truth is rarely known in the real world, simulated data plays a vital role in evaluating the performance of the various causal discovery algorithms proposed in the literature. But recent work highlighted certain artifacts of commonly used data generation techniques for a standard class of structural causal models (SCM) that may be nonphysical, including var- and R2-sortability, where the variables' variance and coefficients of determination (R2) after regressing on all other variables, respectively, increase along the causal order. Some causal methods exploit such artifacts, leading to unrealistic expectations for their performance on real-world data. Some modifications have been proposed to remove these artifacts; notably, the internally-standardized structural causal model (iSCM) avoids varsortability and largely alleviates R2-sortability on sparse causal graphs, but exhibits a reversed R2-sortability pattern for denser graphs not featured in their work. We analyze which sortability patterns we expect to see in real data, and propose a method for drawing coefficients that we argue more effectively samples the space of SCMs. Finally, we propose a novel extension of our SCM generation method to the time series setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>4th C...</summary><p>4th Conference on Causal Learning and Reasoning</p></details> |

While pretrained time series foundation models are gaining popularity, they face the following challenges: (1) Unlike natural language tasks, time series data vary in frequency, channel numbers, historical/prediction lengths. For long-term forecasting tasks in particular, tailored fine-tuning can significantly enhance performance.(2) Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA remain applicable but require adaptation to temporal characteristics. To address these challenges, our TRACE framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Gated DSIC (Gated Dynamic Simulation Importance Calculation), an unbiased LoRA module importance selection mechanism that ensures conditional parameter consistency before and after masking. Experiments demonstrate that Gated DSIC outperforms common fine-tuning. (2) Reconstructed prediction heads for long-term forecasting tasks, which achieve comparable or superior performance to linear probing heads while drastically reducing parameter counts. Extensive experiments on long-/short-term forecasting and anomaly detection tasks across diverse datasets, coupled with ablation studies, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and adaptive control systems are essential to ensure seamless interaction between the wearer and the robotic device, particularly when navigating diverse and dynamic terrains. Despite the recent advances in neural networks for time series analysis, no attempts have been directed towards the classification of ground conditions, categorized into five classes and subsequently determining the ramp's slope and stair's height. In this respect, this paper presents an experimental comparison between eight deep neural network backbones to predict high-level locomotion parameters across diverse terrains. All the models are trained on the publicly available CAMARGO 2021 dataset. IMU-only data equally or outperformed IMU+EMG inputs, promoting a cost-effective and efficient design. Indeeds, using three IMU sensors, the LSTM achieved high terrain classification accuracy (0.94 +- 0.04) and precise ramp slope (1.95 +- 0.58{\deg}) and the CNN-LSTM a stair height (15.65 +- 7.40 mm) estimations. As a further contribution, SHAP analysis justified sensor reduction without performance loss, ensuring a lightweight setup.

Known for its temporal processing prowess, RC significantly lowers training costs compared to conventional recurrent neural networks. A key component in its hardware deployment is the ability to generate dynamic reservoir states. Our research introduces a novel dual-memory RC system, integrating a short-term memory via a WOx-based memristor, capable of achieving 16 distinct states encoded over 4 bits, and a long-term memory component using a TiOx-based memristor within the readout layer. We thoroughly examine both memristor types and leverage the RC system to process temporal data sets. The performance of the proposed RC system is validated through two benchmark tasks: isolated spoken digit recognition with incomplete inputs and Mackey-Glass time series prediction. The system delivered an impressive 98.84% accuracy in digit recognition and sustained a low normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.036 in the time series prediction task, underscoring its capability.

While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

We provide a rigorous mathematical framework to quantify this capacity for random linear reservoirs, showing that it is fully characterised by the spectral properties of the generalised matrix of moments of the random reservoir connectivity matrix. Our analysis focuses on reservoirs with Gaussian connectivity matrices, both symmetric and i.i.d., although the techniques extend naturally to broader classes of random matrices. In the symmetric case, the generalised matrix of moments is a Hankel matrix. Using classical estimates from random matrix theory, we establish that separation capacity deteriorates over time and that, for short inputs, optimal separation in large reservoirs is achieved when the matrix entries are scaled with a factor $\rho_T/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the reservoir dimension and $\rho_T$ depends on the maximum input length. In the i.i.d.\ case, we establish that optimal separation with large reservoirs is consistently achieved when the entries of the reservoir matrix are scaled with the exact factor $1/\sqrt{N}$, which aligns with common implementations of reservoir computing. We further give upper bounds on the quality of separation as a function of the length of the time series. We complement this analysis with an investigation of the likelihood of this separation and its consistency under different architectural choices.</p></details> |  |

Unsupervised contrastive learning has garnered significant interest in learning effective representations from time series data with limited labels. The prevalent approach in existing contrastive learning methods consists of two separate stages: pre-training the encoder on unlabeled datasets and fine-tuning the well-trained model on a small-scale labeled dataset. However, such two-stage approaches suffer from several shortcomings, such as the inability of unsupervised pre-training contrastive loss to directly affect downstream fine-tuning classifiers, and the lack of exploiting the classification loss which is guided by valuable ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model called SLOTS (Semi-supervised Learning fOr Time clasSification). SLOTS receives semi-labeled datasets, comprising a large number of unlabeled samples and a small proportion of labeled samples, and maps them to an embedding space through an encoder. We calculate not only the unsupervised contrastive loss but also measure the supervised contrastive loss on the samples with ground truth. The learned embeddings are fed into a classifier, and the classification loss is calculated using the available true labels. The unsupervised, supervised contrastive losses and classification loss are jointly used to optimize the encoder and classifier. We evaluate SLOTS by comparing it with ten state-of-the-art methods across five datasets. The results demonstrate that SLOTS is a simple yet effective framework. When compared to the two-stage framework, our end-to-end SLOTS utilizes the same input data, consumes a similar computational cost, but delivers significantly improved performance.

However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |

Despite the importance of exploring new activities in real-world scenarios, existing human activity recognition studies generally rely on predefined known activities and often overlook detecting new patterns (novelties) that have not been previously observed during training. Novelty detection in human activities becomes even more challenging due to (1) diversity of patterns within the same known activity, (2) shared patterns between known and new activities, and (3) differences in sensor properties of each activity dataset. We introduce CLAN, a two-tower model that leverages Contrastive Learning with diverse data Augmentation for New activity detection in sensor-based environments. CLAN simultaneously and explicitly utilizes multiple types of strongly shifted data as negative samples in contrastive learning, effectively learning invariant representations that adapt to various pattern variations within the same activity. To enhance the ability to distinguish between known and new activities that share common features, CLAN incorporates both time and frequency domains, enabling the learning of multi-faceted discriminative representations. Additionally, we design an automatic selection mechanism of data augmentation methods tailored to each dataset's properties, generating appropriate positive and negative pairs for contrastive learning. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CLAN achieves a 9.24% improvement in AUROC compared to the best-performing baseline model.</p></details> |  |

The ever-increasing sensorization of manufacturing lines makes processes more observable, but also poses the challenge of continuously analyzing vast amounts of multivariate time series data. These challenges include data quality since data may contain noise, be unlabeled or even mislabeled. A promising approach consists of combining an embedding model with other Machine Learning algorithms to enhance the overall performance in detecting anomalies. Moreover, representing time series as vectors brings many advantages like higher flexibility and improved ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. We tested our solution in a real industrial use case, using data collected from a Bonfiglioli plant.

However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning.

Existing methods typically search for the optimal DAG by optimizing an objective function but face scalability challenges, as their computational demands grow exponentially with the dimensional expansion of variables. To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. Building on this, we introduce two adaptive modules that enhance the algebraic characterization of acyclicity: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML constructs causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring DAG formation while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic causal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

However, despite the success of existing model selection solutions that train a classification model (especially neural network, NN) using historical data as a selector to predict the correct TSAD model for each series, the NN-based selector learning methods used by existing solutions do not make full use of the knowledge in the historical data and require iterating over all training samples, which limits the accuracy and training speed of the selector. To address these limitations, we propose KDSelector, a novel knowledge-enhanced and data-efficient framework for learning the NN-based TSAD model selector, of which three key components are specifically designed to integrate available knowledge into the selector and dynamically prune less important and redundant samples during the learning. We develop a TSAD model selection system with KDSelector as the internal, to demonstrate how users improve the accuracy and training speed of their selectors by using KDSelector as a plug-and-play module.

Traditional clustering algorithms often fail to capture the intrinsic structures in such data. This paper explores a combination of clustering methods, which we called Line Space Clustering (LSC), a representation that transforms data points into lines in a newly defined feature space, enabling clustering based on the similarity of feature value patterns, essentially treating features as sequences. LSC employs a combined distance metric that uses Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances, weighted by a parameter {\alpha}, allowing flexibility in emphasizing shape or magnitude similarities. We delve deeply into the mechanics of DTW and the Savitzky Golay filter, explaining their roles in the algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of LSC on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that randomly experimenting with time-series optimized methods sometimes might surprisingly work on a complex dataset, particularly in noisy environments.

Supraglacial lakes, which form on the ice sheet surface during the summer months, can impact ice sheet dynamics and mass loss; thus, better understanding these lakes' seasonal evolution and dynamics is an important task. This study presents a computationally efficient time series classification approach that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of the Reconstructed Phase Spaces (RPSs) to identify supraglacial lakes based on their seasonal evolution: 1) those that refreeze at the end of the melt season, 2) those that drain during the melt season, and 3) those that become buried, remaining liquid insulated a few meters beneath the surface. Our approach uses time series data from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, which utilize microwave and visible radiation, respectively. Evaluated on a GrIS-wide dataset, the RPS-GMM model, trained on a single representative sample per class, achieves 85.46% accuracy with Sentinel-1 data alone and 89.70% with combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. This performance significantly surpasses existing machine learning and deep learning models which require a large training data. The results demonstrate the robustness of the RPS-GMM model in capturing the complex temporal dynamics of supraglacial lakes with minimal training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA).

While there are several research works on energy optimization, they often fail to address the complexities of real-time fluctuations and the cyclic pattern of energy consumption. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of predictive models by employing sinusoidal encoding on periodic features of time-series data. To demonstrate the increase in performance, several statistical and ensemble machine learning models were trained on an energy demand dataset, using the proposed sinusoidal encoding. The performance of these models was then benchmarked against identical models trained on traditional encoding methods. The results demonstrated a 12.6% improvement of Root Mean Squared Error (from 0.5497 to 0.4802) and a 7.8% increase in the R^2 score (from 0.7530 to 0.8118), indicating that the proposed encoding better captures the cyclic nature of temporal patterns than traditional methods. The proposed methodology significantly improves prediction accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications in smart grid systems.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to assist in financial trend prediction by leveraging quantum resources for improved feature representation and learning. A custom Quantum Neural Network (QNN) regressor is introduced, designed with a novel ansatz tailored for financial applications. Two hybrid optimization strategies are proposed: (1) a sequential approach where classical recurrent models (RNN/LSTM) extract temporal dependencies before quantum processing, and (2) a joint learning framework that optimizes classical and quantum parameters simultaneously. Systematic evaluation using TimeSeriesSplit, k-fold cross-validation, and predictive error analysis highlights the ability of these hybrid models to integrate quantum computing into financial forecasting workflows.

This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |

While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of FMs for patient behavior monitoring through wearable devices remains underexplored. These datasets are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel FM based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), specifically designed to process real-world data from wearable devices. We demonstrate that our pretrained FM, trained on a broad cohort of psychiatric patients, performs downstream tasks via its latent representation without fine-tuning on a held-out cohort of suicidal patients. To illustrate this, we develop a probabilistic change-point detection algorithm for suicide detection and demonstrate the FM's effectiveness in predicting emotional states. Our results show that the discrete latent structure of the VQ-VAE outperforms a state-of-the-art Informer architecture in unsupervised suicide detection, while matching its performance in supervised emotion prediction when the latent dimensionality is increased, though at the cost of reduced unsupervised accuracy. This trade-off highlights the need for future FMs to integrate hybrid discrete-continuous structures for balanced performance across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (31 with appendices), 6 figures (13 with appendices); submitted to UAI 2025</p></details> |

While existing transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, they mainly focus on forecasting and fail to fully exploit the distinctive characteristics of MedTS data. In this paper, we introduce Sparseformer, a transformer specifically designed for MedTS classification. We propose a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global modeling and token compression, allowing dynamic focus on the most informative tokens while distilling redundant features. This mechanism is then applied to the multi-granularity, cross-channel encoding of medical signals, capturing intra- and inter-granularity correlations and inter-channel connections. The sparsification design allows our model to handle heterogeneous inputs of varying lengths and channels directly. Further, we introduce an adaptive label encoder to address label space misalignment across datasets, equipping our model with cross-dataset transferability to alleviate the medical label scarcity issue. Our model outperforms 12 baselines across seven medical datasets under supervised learning. In the few-shot learning experiments, our model also achieves superior average results. In addition, the in-domain and cross-domain experiments among three diagnostic scenarios demonstrate our model's zero-shot learning capability. Collectively, these findings underscore the robustness and transferability of our model in various medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 16 pages, 5 tables</p></details> |

These forecasts are then incorporated into MPC algorithms to estimate future trajectories and optimize action selection under the uncertainty of the future. We evaluate the framework on the task of energy arbitrage, where a Battery Energy Storage System participates in the day-ahead electricity market of the New York state.

Motivated by insights from the Topological Data Analysis (TDA) paradigm, of which real-world data exhibits multi-scale patterns, we construct several graphs using Persistent Homology Filtration -- a mathematical framework describing the multiscale structural properties of data points. Then, we use the constructed graphs as an input to create an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks. The ensemble aggregates the signals from the individual learners via an attention-based routing mechanism, thus systematically encoding the inherent multiscale structures of data. Four different real-world experiments on seismic activity prediction and traffic forecasting (PEMS-BAY, METR-LA) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms single-graph baselines while providing interpretable insights.</p></details> |  |

Theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signal. In non-sparse regimes, analyses have primarily focused on linear regression models with the design matrix having independent rows. In this paper, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal, as well as for minimum mean-square errors. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing VAMP algorithm and show that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p></details> |  |

Recent years, there are increasing interest of the data mining community to develop time series deep learning models to pursue better performance. The models performance often evaluate by certain evaluation metrics such as RMSE, Accuracy, and F1-score. Yet time series data are often hard to interpret and are collected with unknown environmental factors, sensor configuration, latent physic mechanisms, and non-stationary evolving behavior. As a result, a model that is better on standard metric-based evaluation may not always perform better in real-world tasks. In this blue sky paper, we aim to explore the challenge that exists in the metric-based evaluation framework for time series data mining and propose a potential blue-sky idea -- developing a knowledge-discovery-based evaluation framework, which aims to effectively utilize domain-expertise knowledge to evaluate a model.

Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits.

Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample. For example, state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches, first classify each element of the sample (e.g., image patch) as normal or anomalous and then classify the entire sample as anomalous if it contains anomalous elements. However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in image-level logical anomaly detection and sequence-level time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12245</p></details> |

This complexity, stemming from interactions among EVs, PV systems, customer behavior, and weather conditions, calls for a scalable framework to capture a full range of possible scenarios and analyze grid responses to factor in compound uncertainty. Although this process is challenging for many utilities today, the need to model numerous grid parameters as random variables and evaluate the impact on the system from many different perspectives will become increasingly essential to facilitate more strategic and well-informed planning investments. We present a scalable, stochastic-aware distribution system planning application that addresses these uncertainties by capturing spatial and temporal variability through a Markov model and conducting Monte Carlo simulations leveraging modular cloud-based architecture.

Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, large foundation models are able to preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors. We attribute this success to foundation models' ability to perform in-context learning and identify context parroting as a simple mechanism used by these models to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the potential of foundation models as a tool for probing nonlinear and complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13th ...</summary><p>13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

When analyzing time series, we often seek to understand the underlying events occurring in the measured environment. For example, one might ask: What caused a sharp drop in the stock price?

We curate a new benchmark featuring win probabilities collected from 4,200 basketball and American football games, featuring 1.7M timesteps with real value data and corresponding natural language events. Building on the recent wave of using LLMs on time series, we evaluate 16 LLMs and find that they demonstrate promising abilities to infer events from time series data. The open-weights DeepSeek-R1 32B model outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o.

A more general approach leveraging the medical reports of clinical EEG recordings is to learn mappings between medical reports and EEG recordings. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework EEG-CLIP that aligns EEG time series and their corresponding clinical text descriptions in a shared embedding space. We investigate its potential for versatile EEG decoding, assessing performance on a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, results show that EEG-CLIP manages to nontrivially align text and EEG representations.

Despite this, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking. This method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. Extensive experiments across multiple models, including QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1, consistently show performance improvements on various benchmarks such as AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and LiveCodeBench. For instance, the accuracy of QwQ-32B improved from 80.3% (Round 1) to 82.1% (Round 2) on the AIME 2024 dataset, while DeepSeek-R1 showed a similar increase from 79.7% to 82.0%.

Long video data presents challenges for VLMs due to context window limitations and the difficulty of pinpointing frames containing the answer. Our novel video agent, FALCONEye, combines a VLM and a Large Language Model (LLM) to search relevant information along the video, and locate the frames with the answer. FALCONEye novelty relies on 1) the proposed meta-architecture, which is better suited to tackle hour-long videos compared to short video approaches in the state-of-the-art; 2) a new efficient exploration algorithm to locate the information using short clips, captions and answer confidence; and 3) our state-of-the-art VLMs calibration analysis for the answer confidence. Our agent is built over a small-size VLM and a medium-size LLM being accessible to run on standard computational resources. We also release FALCON-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate long (average > 1 hour) Video Answer Search challenges, highlighting the need for open-ended question evaluation. Our experiments show FALCONEye's superior performance than the state-of-the-art in FALCON-Bench, and similar or better performance in related benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging flexible perspectives and rapid maneuverability, UAVs extend traditional systems' perception and action capabilities, garnering widespread attention from academia and industry. However, current UAV operations primarily depend on human control, with only limited autonomy in simple scenarios, and lack the intelligence and adaptability needed for more complex environments and tasks. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) demonstrates remarkable problem-solving and generalization capabilities, offering a promising pathway for advancing UAV intelligence. This paper explores the integration of LLMs and UAVs, beginning with an overview of UAV systems' fundamental components and functionalities, followed by an overview of the state-of-the-art in LLM technology. Subsequently, it systematically highlights the multimodal data resources available for UAVs, which provide critical support for training and evaluation. Furthermore, it categorizes and analyzes key tasks and application scenarios where UAVs and LLMs converge. Finally, a reference roadmap towards agentic UAVs is proposed, aiming to enable UAVs to achieve agentic intelligence through autonomous perception, memory, reasoning, and tool utilization.

While LLMs encode partial knowledge of SVG data from web pages during training, recent findings suggest that semantically ambiguous and tokenized representations within LLMs may result in hallucinations in vector primitive predictions. Additionally, LLM training typically lacks modeling and understanding of the rendering sequence of vector paths, which can lead to occlusion between output vector primitives. In this paper, we present LLM4SVG, an initial yet substantial step toward bridging this gap by enabling LLMs to better understand and generate vector graphics. LLM4SVG facilitates a deeper understanding of SVG components through learnable semantic tokens, which precisely encode these tokens and their corresponding properties to generate semantically aligned SVG outputs. Using a series of learnable semantic tokens, a structured dataset for instruction following is developed to support comprehension and generation across two primary tasks. Our method introduces a modular architecture to existing large language models, integrating semantic tags, vector instruction encoders, fine-tuned commands, and powerful LLMs to tightly combine geometric, appearance, and language information. To overcome the scarcity of SVG-text instruction data, we developed an automated data generation pipeline that collected our SVGX-SFT Dataset, consisting of high-quality human-designed SVGs and 580k SVG instruction following data specifically crafted for LLM training, which facilitated the adoption of the supervised fine-tuning strategy popular in LLM development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

However, serving many fine-tuned LLMs concurrently is challenging due to the sporadic, bursty, and varying request patterns of different LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present DeltaZip, an LLM serving system that efficiently serves multiple full-parameter fine-tuned models concurrently by aggressively compressing model deltas by up to 10x while maintaining high model quality. The key insight behind this design is that fine-tuning results in small-magnitude changes to the pre-trained model. By co-designing the serving system with the compression algorithm, DeltaZip achieves 2x to 12x improvement in throughput compared to the state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> | EuroSys 2025' |

However, their lack of emotion and fine-grained role awareness limits the model's ability to provide personalized and diverse interactions further. Current methods face high costs in collecting high-quality annotated data for scenarios such as role-playing, and traditional human alignment methods are difficult to deploy due to the inherent diversity of model behavior in role-playing scenarios. Inspired by the alignment of models for safety behaviors through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), in this paper, we revisit model role-playing behavior from the perspective of persona alignment and propose a novel annotation-free framework named \textbf{\underline{P}}ersona-Aware \textbf{\underline{C}}ontrastive \textbf{\underline{L}}earning (PCL) to align LLMs' behavior during role-playing, enhancing the model's role consistency. Specifically, we first design a role chain method to encourage the model to self-question based on the role characteristics and dialogue context to adjust personality consistency. Then, we further enhance the model's role-playing strategy through iterative contrastive learning between the use of role characteristics and not. Experiments on both black-box and white-box LLMs show that LLMs equipped with PCL significantly outperform vanilla LLMs under automatic evaluation methods (CharEval \& GPT-4) and human expert evaluation.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

However, their broad applicability comes at a high-cost computational overhead, particularly in auto-regressive decoding where each step requires a forward pass. In domain-specific settings, general-purpose capabilities are unnecessary and can be exchanged for efficiency. In this work, we take a novel perspective on domain adaptation, reducing latency and computational costs by adapting the vocabulary to focused domains of interest. We introduce AdaptiVocab, an end-to-end approach for vocabulary adaptation, designed to enhance LLM efficiency in low-resource domains. AdaptiVocab can be applied to any tokenizer and architecture, modifying the vocabulary by replacing tokens with domain-specific n-gram-based tokens, thereby reducing the number of tokens required for both input processing and output generation. AdaptiVocab initializes new n-token embeddings using an exponentially weighted combination of existing embeddings and employs a lightweight fine-tuning phase that can be efficiently performed on a single GPU. We evaluate two 7B LLMs across three niche domains, assessing efficiency, generation quality, and end-task performance. Our results show that AdaptiVocab reduces token usage by over 25% without compromising performance</p></details> |  |

While the large dimensionality of input token space makes it inevitable to find adversarial prompts that can jailbreak these models, we aim to evaluate whether safety fine-tuned LLMs are safe against natural prompts which are semantically related to toxic seed prompts that elicit safe responses after alignment. We surprisingly find that popular aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 can be compromised using naive prompts that are NOT even crafted with an objective of jailbreaking the model. Furthermore, we empirically show that given a seed prompt that elicits a toxic response from an unaligned model, one can systematically generate several semantically related natural prompts that can jailbreak aligned LLMs. Towards this, we propose a method of Response Guided Question Augmentation (ReG-QA) to evaluate the generalization of safety aligned LLMs to natural prompts, that first generates several toxic answers given a seed question using an unaligned LLM (Q to A), and further leverages an LLM to generate questions that are likely to produce these answers (A to Q). We interestingly find that safety fine-tuned LLMs such as GPT-4o are vulnerable to producing natural jailbreak questions from unsafe content (without denial) and can thus be used for the latter (A to Q) step. We obtain attack success rates that are comparable to/ better than leading adversarial attack methods on the JailbreakBench leaderboard, while being significantly more stable against defenses such as Smooth-LLM and Synonym Substitution, which are effective against existing all attacks on the leaderboard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

As a result, the BrainFloat16 (BF16) precision has become the de facto standard for LLM training, with hardware support included in recent generations of accelerators. This trend has gone even further in the latest processors, where FP8 has recently been introduced. However, prior experience with FP16, which was found to be less stable than BF16, raises concerns as to whether FP8, with even fewer bits than FP16, can be a cost-effective option for LLM training. We argue that reduced-precision training schemes must have similar training stability and hyperparameter sensitivities to their higher-precision counterparts in order to be cost-effective. However, we find that currently available methods for FP8 training are not robust enough to allow their use as economical replacements. This prompts us to investigate the stability of reduced-precision LLM training in terms of robustness across random seeds, learning rates, and datasets. To this end, we propose new evaluation techniques and a new metric for quantifying loss landscape sharpness in autoregressive language models. By simulating incremental bit reductions in floating-point representations, we analyze the relationship between representational power and training stability with the intent of aiding future research into the field.</p></details> |  |

Most research focuses on hallucinations as deviations from information seen during training. However, the opaque nature of an LLM's parametric knowledge complicates the understanding of why generated texts appear ungrounded: The LLM might not have picked up the necessary knowledge from large and often inaccessible datasets, or the information might have been changed or contradicted during further training. Our focus is on hallucinations involving information not used in training, which we determine by using recency to ensure the information emerged after a cut-off date. This study investigates these hallucinations by detecting them at sentence level using different internal states of various LLMs. We present HalluRAG, a dataset designed to train classifiers on these hallucinations. Depending on the model and quantization, MLPs trained on HalluRAG detect hallucinations with test accuracies ranging up to 75 %, with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 achieving the highest test accuracies. Our results show that IAVs detect hallucinations as effectively as CEVs and reveal that answerable and unanswerable prompts are encoded differently as separate classifiers for these categories improved accuracy. However, HalluRAG showed some limited generalizability, advocating for more diversity in datasets on hallucinations.</p></details> | 19 pages, 3 figures |

Through statistical learning on current datasets, we observe that redundancy occurs in both repeated and answer-irrelevant frames, and the corresponding frames vary with different questions. This suggests the possibility of adopting dynamic encoding to balance detailed video information preservation with token budget reduction. To this end, we propose a dynamic cooperative network, DynFocus, for memory-efficient video encoding in this paper. Specifically, i) a Dynamic Event Prototype Estimation (DPE) module to dynamically select meaningful frames for question answering; (ii) a Compact Cooperative Encoding (CCE) module that encodes meaningful frames with detailed visual appearance and the remaining frames with sketchy perception separately.

Weight quantization is crucial for reducing the memory footprint of LLMs on devices. However, low-bit LLMs necessitate mixed precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) of low precision weights and high precision activations during inference. Existing systems, lacking native support for mpGEMM, resort to dequantize weights for high precision computation. Such an indirect way can lead to a significant inference overhead. In this paper, we introduce T-MAC, an innovative lookup table(LUT)-based method designed for efficient low-bit LLM (i.e., weight-quantized LLM) inference on CPUs. T-MAC directly supports mpGEMM without dequantization, while simultaneously eliminating multiplications and reducing additions required. Specifically, T-MAC transforms the traditional data-type-centric multiplication to bit-wise table lookup, and enables a unified and scalable mpGEMM solution. Our LUT-based kernels scale linearly to the weight bit-width. Evaluated on low-bit Llama and BitNet models, T-MAC demonstrates up to 4x increase in throughput and 70% reduction in energy consumption compared to llama.cpp. For BitNet-b1.58-3B, T-MAC delivers a token generation throughput of 30 tokens/s with a single core and 71 tokens/s with eight cores on M2-Ultra, and 11 tokens/s on lower-end devices like Raspberry Pi 5, which significantly exceeds the adult average reading speed. T-MAC with LUT-based computing paradigm, paves the way for the practical deployment of low-bit LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices without compromising computational efficiency.

Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments.

Vectorization, a crucial optimization for enhancing code performance, often fails because of the compiler's inability to recognize complex code patterns, which commonly require extensive empirical expertise. LLMs, with their ability to capture intricate patterns, thus providing a promising solution to this challenge. This paper presents VecTrans, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to enhance compiler-based code vectorization. VecTrans first employs compiler analysis to identify potentially vectorizable code regions. It then utilizes an LLM to refactor these regions into patterns that are more amenable to the compiler's auto-vectorization. To ensure semantic correctness, VecTrans further integrates a hybrid validation mechanism at the intermediate representation (IR) level. With the above efforts, VecTrans combines the adaptability of LLMs with the precision of compiler vectorization, thereby effectively opening up the vectorization opportunities. Experimental results show that among all 50 TSVC functions unvectorizable by Clang, GCC, and BiShengCompiler, VecTrans successfully vectorizes 23 cases (46%) and achieves an average speedup of 2.02x, greatly surpassing state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

This raises the question: Are LLMs capable of handling cross-lingual summarization tasks for low-resource languages? To resolve this question, we fully explore the potential of large language models on cross-lingual summarization task for low-resource languages through our four-step zero-shot method: Summarization, Improvement, Translation and Refinement (SITR) with correspondingly designed prompts.

With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), these models have become highly effective at performing text classification tasks. However, they still show vulnerabilities to variations in text formatting. Recent research demonstrates that modifying input formats, such as vertically aligning words for encoder-based models, can substantially lower accuracy in text classification tasks. While easily understood by humans, these inputs can significantly mislead models, posing a potential risk of bypassing detection in real-world scenarios involving harmful or sensitive information. With the expanding application of LLMs, a crucial question arises: Do decoder-based LLMs exhibit similar vulnerabilities to vertically formatted text input? In this paper, we investigate the impact of vertical text input on the performance of various LLMs across multiple text classification datasets and analyze the underlying causes. Our findings are as follows: (i) Vertical text input significantly degrades the accuracy of LLMs in text classification tasks. (ii) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning does not help LLMs recognize vertical input or mitigate its vulnerability, but few-shot learning with careful analysis does.

The reasoning tokens of these models enable self-correction within reasoning chains, enhancing robustness. This motivates our exploration: how vulnerable are reasoning LLMs to subtle errors in their input reasoning chains? We introduce "Compromising Thought" (CPT), a vulnerability where models presented with reasoning tokens containing manipulated calculation results tend to ignore correct reasoning steps and adopt incorrect results instead. Through systematic evaluation across multiple reasoning LLMs, we design three increasingly explicit prompting methods to measure CPT resistance, revealing that models struggle significantly to identify and correct these manipulations. Notably, contrary to existing research suggesting structural alterations affect model performance more than content modifications, we find that local ending token manipulations have greater impact on reasoning outcomes than structural changes.

This paper evaluates the capabilities of the Llama 2-70B model in automating these tasks for scientific applications written in commonly used programming languages. Using representative test problems, we assess the model's capacity to generate code, documentation, and unit tests, as well as its ability to translate existing code between commonly used programming languages. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the compilation, runtime behavior, and correctness of the generated and translated code. Additionally, we assess the quality of automatically generated code, documentation and unit tests. Our results indicate that while Llama 2-70B frequently generates syntactically correct and functional code for simpler numerical tasks, it encounters substantial difficulties with more complex, parallelized, or distributed computations, requiring considerable manual corrections. We identify key limitations and suggest areas for future improvements to better leverage AI-driven automation in scientific computing workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, biases inherent in these models may lead to unfair hiring practices, reinforcing societal prejudices and undermining workplace diversity. This study examines the performance and fairness of LLMs in job-resume matching tasks within the English language and U.S. context. It evaluates how factors such as gender, race, and educational background influence model decisions, providing critical insights into the fairness and reliability of LLMs in HR applications. Our findings indicate that while recent models have reduced biases related to explicit attributes like gender and race, implicit biases concerning educational background remain significant. These results highlight the need for ongoing evaluation and the development of advanced bias mitigation strategies to ensure equitable hiring practices when using LLMs in industry settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025: Industry Track</p></details> |

However, in information-intensive tasks, the prompt length can grow fast, leading to increased computational requirements, performance degradation, and induced biases from irrelevant or redundant information. Recently, various prompt compression techniques have been introduced to optimize the trade-off between reducing input length and retaining performance. We propose a holistic evaluation framework that allows for in-depth analysis of prompt compression methods. We focus on three key aspects, besides compression ratio: (i) downstream task performance, (ii) grounding in the input context, and (iii) information preservation. Through this framework, we investigate state-of-the-art soft and hard compression methods, showing that they struggle to preserve key details from the original prompt, limiting their performance on complex tasks. We demonstrate that modifying soft prompting methods to control better the granularity of the compressed information can significantly improve their effectiveness -- up to +23\% in downstream task performance, more than +8 BERTScore points in grounding, and 2.7x more entities preserved in compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 23 tables</p></details> |

This widespread adoption necessitates a critical examination of potential biases arising from the interplay between these LLM-based components. This paper synthesizes existing research and presents novel experiment designs that explore how LLM-based rankers and assistants influence LLM-based judges. We provide the first empirical evidence of LLM judges exhibiting significant bias towards LLM-based rankers. Furthermore, we observe limitations in LLM judges' ability to discern subtle system performance differences. Contrary to some previous findings, our preliminary study does not find evidence of bias against AI-generated content. These results highlight the need for a more holistic view of the LLM-driven information ecosystem. To this end, we offer initial guidelines and a research agenda to ensure the reliable use of LLMs in IR evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Given the English description of a programming problem and a set of unit tests, the model's goal is to synthesize the correct program that solves the problem and passes the tests. QualityFlow includes large language model (LLM) agents resembling a software development team, including code generation, testing, and self-debugging. We propose the LLM Quality Checker, which explicitly "imagines" whether the synthesized programs' execution would conform to the unit tests. The Quality Checks dynamically control the workflow, including actions to submit the final answer, clarify the problem statement, and revert previous workflow steps. Our experiments show that the Quality Checker can precisely accept any correct program, mitigate faulty synthesized tests, and prevent potential workflow deviation. QualityFlow establishes the state-of-the-art results on four program synthesis benchmarks: MBPP, HumanEval, and stricter evaluations from MBPP-EvalPlus and HumanEval-EvalPlus.</p></details> |  |

However, satisfying both TTFT and TBT service-level objectives (SLOs) is challenging. To address this, we propose a system, named CacheOPT for mitigating KV Cache competition, based on key insights from our measurements, incorporating novel components. First, it estimates a request's output length, bounding the deviation with a high specified probability, adjusted based on the request arrival rate. Second, it allocates the estimated KVC demand to a request, and reuses other requests' allocated KVC to avoid preemptions while reducing waiting time. Third, it proactively allocates KVC before instead of at the time a request exhausts its allocation and reserves KVC globally to prevent preemptions. Fourth, it chooses a request that has long TBT SLO, long job remaining time and short preemption time to preempt. Fifth, it selects the shortest-latency strategy between swapping and recomputation for preemptions. Experiments show that CacheOPT achieves up to 3.29$\times$ and 2.83$\times$ lower tail TBT and tail TTFT, 47\% and 53\% higher TTFT and TBT SLO attainments, and supports up to 1.58$\times$ higher request arrival rate than the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing schedulers primarily target either GPU compute or Key-Value Cache (KVC) utilization, failing to fully optimize both GPU compute and KVC usage during each iteration or guarantee timely KVC allocations when needed. To address these challenges, we conducted a trace-based experimental analysis and made insightful observations, leading to the design of a system called EconoServe. EconoServe maximizes multi-resource utilization while ensuring service-level objective (SLO) guarantees in LLM serving. To enable adding prompts to a batch to maximize GPU utilization in each iteration, EconoServe maintains separate waiting queues for prompt processing tasks (PTs) and generation tasks (GTs). It batches GTs with the same predicted response lengths (RL) to save scheduling time and allocates KVC space for the predicted RL to avoid KVC allocation failures. It further has a novel KVC pipelining method, allowing sharing allocated but unused KVC space to enhance KVC utilization. In addition, it prioritizes queued requests that occupy more KVC to release KVC earlier and satisfy request service-level-objective (SLO). Experimental results demonstrate that EconoServe increases throughput by up to 4$\times$ with the same level of latency, generates up to 91\% lower job completion time and up to 91\% higher SLO satisfaction ratio compared to vLLM. It also reduces the number of GPUs used in DistServe by up to 78\% while maintaining the same level of goodput.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, existing on-policy algorithms used for post-training are inherently incompatible with the use of experience replay buffers, which can be populated scalably by distributed off-policy actors to enhance exploration as compute increases. We propose efficiently obtaining this benefit of replay buffers via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), a massively scalable LLM RL system. In contrast to existing approaches, TBA uses a larger fraction of compute on search, constantly generating off-policy data for a central replay buffer. A training node simultaneously samples data from this buffer based on reward or recency to update the policy using Trajectory Balance (TB), a diversity-seeking RL objective introduced for GFlowNets. TBA offers three key advantages: (1) decoupled training and search, speeding up training wall-clock time by 4x or more; (2) improved diversity through large-scale off-policy sampling; and (3) scalable search for sparse reward settings. On mathematical reasoning, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming (diverse and representative post-training tasks), TBA produces speed and performance improvements over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, they still face substantial challenges of low communication efficiency and suboptimal task performance, making the careful design of the agents' communication topologies particularly important. Inspired by the management theory that roles in an efficient team are often dynamically adjusted, we propose AgentDropout, which identifies redundant agents and communication across different communication rounds by optimizing the adjacency matrices of the communication graphs and eliminates them to enhance both token efficiency and task performance. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, AgentDropout achieves an average reduction of 21.6% in prompt token consumption and 18.4% in completion token consumption, along with a performance improvement of 1.14 on the tasks. Furthermore, the extended experiments demonstrate that AgentDropout achieves notable domain transferability and structure robustness, revealing its reliability and effectiveness. We release our code at https://github.com/wangzx1219/AgentDropout.</p></details> |  |

Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures |

Our benchmarks consist of decision-making tasks derived from key problems in economics. To forestall saturation, the benchmark tasks are synthetically generated with scalable difficulty levels. Additionally, we propose litmus tests, a new kind of quantitative measure for LLMs and LLM agents. Unlike benchmarks, litmus tests quantify differences in character, values, and tendencies of LLMs and LLM agents, by considering their behavior when faced with tradeoffs (e.g., efficiency versus equality) where there is no objectively right or wrong behavior. Overall, our benchmarks and litmus tests assess the abilities and tendencies of LLM agents in tackling complex economic problems in diverse settings spanning procurement, scheduling, task allocation, and pricing -- applications that should grow in importance as such agents are further integrated into the economy.</p></details> |  |

However, they fail to plan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning task. Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting, fine-tuning, and explicit "reasoning" still yield incorrect plans and usually fail to generalize to larger tasks. In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of increasing size. For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several domain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them on a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the strongest one. The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen test tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical planning. They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning. These findings are especially remarkable given that our proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner and the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code. In some domains, the LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing that they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more informative than the state-of-the-art heuristics. Overall, our results show that sampling a set of planning heuristic function programs can significantly improve the planning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an LLM-guided hierarchical RL framework, termed LDSC, that leverages LLM-driven subgoal selection and option reuse to enhance sample efficiency, generalization, and multi-task adaptability. Traditional RL methods often suffer from inefficient exploration and high computational cost. Hierarchical RL helps with these challenges, but existing methods often fail to reuse options effectively when faced with new tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a three-stage framework that uses LLMs for subgoal generation given natural language description of the task, a reusable option learning and selection method, and an action-level policy, enabling more effective decision-making across diverse tasks. By incorporating LLMs for subgoal prediction and policy guidance, our approach improves exploration efficiency and enhances learning performance. On average, LDSC outperforms the baseline by 55.9\% in average reward, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex RL settings.

KV cache quantization has emerged as a promising solution, with prior work showing that 4-bit or even 2-bit quantization can maintain model accuracy while reducing memory costs. However, despite these benefits, preliminary implementations for the low-bit KV cache struggle to deliver the expected speedup due to quantization and dequantization overheads and the lack of Tensor Cores utilization. In this work, we propose BitDecoding, a GPU-optimized framework that unlocks Tensor Cores for efficient decoding with low-bit KV cache. Efficiently leveraging Tensor Cores for low-bit KV cache is challenging due to the dynamic nature of KV cache generation at each decoding step. BitDecoding addresses these challenges with a Tensor Cores-Centric BitFusion Scheme that ensures data layout compatibility to enable high utilization of Tensor Cores. Additionally, BitDecoding incorporates a warp-efficient parallel decoding kernel and a fine-grained asynchronous pipeline, minimizing dequantization overhead and improving computational efficiency. Experiments show that BitDecoding achieves up to 7.5x speedup on RTX 4090, 4.8x on A100, and 8.9x on H100, compared to FP16 FlashDecoding-v2. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art low-bit KV cache implementation (QServe) by up to 4.3x. On LLaMA-3.1-8B with a 128K sequence length, BitDecoding reduces single-batch decoding latency by 3x, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-context generation scenarios.

However, manually writing Verilog code remains a complex and time-consuming task that demands both expert knowledge and iterative refinement. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their structured text generation capabilities, we propose VeriMind, an agentic LLM framework for Verilog code generation that significantly automates and optimizes the synthesis process. Unlike traditional LLM-based code generators, VeriMind employs a structured reasoning approach: given a user-provided prompt describing design requirements, the system first formulates a detailed train of thought before the final Verilog code is generated. This multi-step methodology enhances interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in hardware design. In addition, we introduce a novel evaluation metric-pass@ARC-which combines the conventional pass@k measure with Average Refinement Cycles (ARC) to capture both success rate and the efficiency of iterative refinement. Experimental results on diverse hardware design tasks demonstrated that our approach achieved up to $8.3\%$ improvement on pass@k metric and $8.1\%$ on pass@ARC metric. These findings underscore the transformative potential of agentic LLMs in automated hardware design, RTL development, and digital system synthesis.</p></details> |  |

However, current research lacks a in-depth analysis of the superior and applicable scenarios of each PTQ strategy. In addition, existing algorithms focus primarily on performance, overlooking the trade-off among model size, performance, and quantization bitwidth. To mitigate these confusions, we provide a novel benchmark for LLMs PTQ in this paper. Firstly, in order to support our benchmark, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy for existing mainstream methods by scrutinizing their computational strategies (e.g., optimization-based, compensation-based, etc.). Then, we conduct extensive experiments with the baseline within each class, covering models with various sizes (7B-70B), bitwidths, training levels (LLaMA1/2/3/3.1), architectures (Mixtral, DeepSeekMoE and Mamba) and modality (LLaVA1.5 and VILA1.5) on a wide range of evaluation metrics.Through comparative analysis on the results, we summarize the superior of each PTQ strategy and modelsize-bitwidth trade-off considering the performance. For example, our benchmark reveals that compensation-based technique demonstrates outstanding cross-architecture robustness and extremely low-bit PTQ for ultra large models should be reexamined. Finally, we further accordingly claim that a practical combination of compensation and other PTQ strategy can achieve SOTA various robustness. We believe that our benchmark will provide valuable recommendations for the deployment of LLMs and future research on PTQ approaches.We conduct an repository for our benchmark at https://github.com/zjq0455/PTQ_Benchmark.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 fugures |

However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identifying 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a popular and efficient training technique for updating or domain-specific adaptation of LLMs. In this study, we investigate how new facts can be incorporated into the LLM using LoRA without compromising the previously learned knowledge. We fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B-instruct using LoRA with varying amounts of new knowledge. Our experiments have shown that the best results are obtained when the training data contains a mixture of known and new facts. However, this approach is still potentially harmful because the model's performance on external question-answering benchmarks declines after such fine-tuning. When the training data is biased towards certain entities, the model tends to regress to few overrepresented answers. In addition, we found that the model becomes more confident and refuses to provide an answer in only few cases. These findings highlight the potential pitfalls of LoRA-based LLM updates and underscore the importance of training data composition and tuning parameters to balance new knowledge integration and general model capabilities.</p></details> |  |

The community relies on high-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels. Unfortunately, HBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity, which reduces core utilization and increases costs. Recent advancements enabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value cache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity. The literature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use low bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier values. While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth simultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier detection is excessively high, negating the advantages. We propose Oaken, an acceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance simultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware. To effectively find a sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache quantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier thresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale online. To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible performance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory management units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators. We built an Oaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation. Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256, Oaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU, incurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\% on average, compared to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 14 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |

Pretraining on vast web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research community is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge, improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various real-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward hacking, and inference-time trade-offs.

Most existing studies focus on judging the final answer at the problem level, while they ignore detailed feedback on each step in a math problem-solving process, which requires abilities of semantic understanding and reasoning. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to boost large language model (LLM) for step-level automatic math correction, named StepAMC. Particularly, we convert the step-level automatic math correction within the text classification task into an RL problem to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Then, we design a space-constrained policy network to improve the stability of RL. Then, we introduce a fine-grained reward network to convert the binary human feedback into a continuous value. We conduct extensive experiments over two benchmark datasets and the results show that our model outperforms the eleven strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, the causal hallucinations between a step of reasoning and corresponding state transitions are becoming a significant obstacle to advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities, especially in long-range reasoning tasks. This paper proposes a non-chain-based reasoning framework for simultaneous consideration of causal significance and consistency, i.e., the Causal Significance and Consistency Enhancer (CSCE). We customize LLM's loss function utilizing treatment effect assessments to enhance its reasoning ability from two aspects: causal significance and consistency. This ensures that the model captures essential causal relationships and maintains robust and consistent performance across various scenarios. Additionally, we transform the reasoning process from the cascading multiple one-step reasoning commonly used in Chain-Based methods, like CoT, to a causal-enhanced method that outputs the entire reasoning process in one go, further improving the model's reasoning efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method improves both the reasoning success rate and speed. These improvements further demonstrate that non-chain-based methods can also aid LLMs in completing reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,4 figures.

To address this issue, researchers have sought to apply network pruning techniques to LLMs. A critical challenge in pruning is allocation the sparsity for each layer. Recent sparsity allocation methods is often based on heuristics or search that can easily lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we conducted an extensive investigation into various LLMs and revealed three significant discoveries: (1) the layerwise pruning sensitivity (LPS) of LLMs is highly non-uniform, (2) the choice of pruning metric affects LPS, and (3) the performance of a sparse model is related to the uniformity of its layerwise redundancy level. Based on these observations, we propose that the layerwise sparsity of LLMs should adhere to three principles: \emph{non-uniformity}, \emph{pruning metric dependency}, and \emph{uniform layerwise redundancy level} in the pruned model. To this end, we proposed Maximum Redundancy Pruning (MRP), an iterative pruning algorithm that prunes in the most redundant layers (\emph{i.e.}, those with the highest non-outlier ratio) at each iteration. The achieved layerwise sparsity aligns with the outlined principles. We conducted extensive experiments on publicly available LLMs, including the LLaMA2 and OPT, across various benchmarks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of MRP, demonstrating its superiority over previous methods.</p></details> |  |

However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) using process rewards and iterative self-play, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Bridging Writing Manner Gap in Visual Instruction Tuning by Creating LLM-aligned Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18320v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18320v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs), the instruction quality during the visual instruction tuning stage significantly influences the performance of modality alignment. In this paper, we assess the instruction quality from a unique perspective termed \textbf{Writing Manner}, which encompasses the selection of vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure to convey specific semantics. We argue that there exists a substantial writing manner gap between the visual instructions and the base Large Language Models (LLMs) within LMMs. This gap forces the pre-trained base LLMs to deviate from their original writing styles, leading to capability degradation of both base LLMs and LMMs. To bridge the writing manner gap while preserving the original semantics, we propose directly leveraging the base LLM to align the writing manner of soft-format visual instructions with that of the base LLM itself, resulting in novel LLM-aligned instructions. The manual writing manner evaluation results demonstrate that our approach successfully minimizes the writing manner gap. By utilizing LLM-aligned instructions, the baseline models LLaVA-7B and QwenVL demonstrate enhanced resistance to hallucinations and non-trivial comprehensive improvements across all $15$ visual and language benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

As attack techniques grow increasingly sophisticated and stealthy, the arms race between cyber defenders and attackers continues to intensify. The revolutionary impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up numerous opportunities in various fields, including cybersecurity. An intriguing question arises: can the extensive knowledge embedded in LLMs be harnessed for provenance analysis and play a positive role in identifying previously unknown malicious events? To seek a deeper understanding of this issue, we propose a new strategy for taking advantage of LLMs in provenance-based threat detection. In our design, the state-of-the-art LLM offers additional details in provenance data interpretation, leveraging their knowledge of system calls, software identity, and high-level understanding of application execution context. The advanced contextualized embedding capability is further utilized to capture the rich semantics of event descriptions. We comprehensively examine the quality of the resulting embeddings, and it turns out that they offer promising avenues. Subsequently, machine learning models built upon these embeddings demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world data. In our evaluation, supervised threat detection achieves a precision of 99.0%, and semi-supervised anomaly detection attains a precision of 96.9%.</p></details> |  |

A Live Arena Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18313v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18313v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains, but their effectiveness in financial decision making, particularly in fund investment, remains inadequately evaluated. Current benchmarks primarily assess LLMs understanding of financial documents rather than their ability to manage assets or analyze trading opportunities in dynamic market conditions. A critical limitation in existing evaluation methodologies is the backtesting approach, which suffers from information leakage when LLMs are evaluated on historical data they may have encountered during pretraining. This paper introduces DeepFund, a comprehensive platform for evaluating LLM based trading strategies in a simulated live environment. Our approach implements a multi agent framework where LLMs serve as both analysts and managers, creating a realistic simulation of investment decision making. The platform employs a forward testing methodology that mitigates information leakage by evaluating models on market data released after their training cutoff dates. We provide a web interface that visualizes model performance across different market conditions and investment parameters, enabling detailed comparative analysis. Through DeepFund, we aim to provide a more accurate and fair assessment of LLMs capabilities in fund investment, offering insights into their potential real world applications in financial markets.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, the performance of LLMs in repository-level context code translation remains suboptimal due to complex dependencies and context, hindering their adoption in industrial settings. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based code translation technique K-Trans, which leverages triple knowledge augmentation to enhance LLM's translation quality under repository context in real-world software development. First, K-Trans constructs a translation knowledge base by extracting relevant information from target-language codebases, the repository being translated, and prior translation results. Second, for each function to be translated, K-Trans retrieves relevant triple knowledge, including target-language code samples, dependency usage examples, and successful translation function pairs, serving as references to enhance LLM for translation. Third, K-Trans constructs a knowledge-augmented translation prompt using the retrieved triple knowledge and employs LLMs to generate the translated code while preserving repository context. It further leverages LLMs for self-debugging, enhancing translation correctness. The experiments show that K-Trans substantially outperforms the baseline adapted from previous work by 19.4%/40.2% relative improvement in pass@1 and 0.138 in CodeBLEU. It is important to note that the results also demonstrate that each knowledge significantly contributes to K-Trans's effectiveness in handling repository-level context code translation, with dependency usage examples making the most notable contribution. Moreover, as the self-evolution process progresses, the knowledge base continuously enhances the LLM's performance across various aspects of the repository-level code translation.</p></details> |  |

Our findings indicate that LLMs are more effective at assessing claims in national or international news stories than in local news stories, better at evaluating static information than dynamic information, and better at verifying true claims compared to false ones. We hypothesize that this disparity arises because the former types of claims are better represented in the training data. Additionally, we find that incorporating retrieved results from a search engine in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setting significantly reduces the number of claims an LLM cannot assess. However, this approach also increases the occurrence of incorrect assessments, partly due to irrelevant or low-quality search results. This diagnostic study highlights the need for future research on fact-checking machine-generated reports to prioritize improving the precision and relevance of retrieved information to better support fact-checking efforts. Furthermore, claims about dynamic events and local news may require human-in-the-loop fact-checking systems to ensure accuracy and reliability.</p></details> |  |

To lower costs, maximizing the request batch size by managing GPU memory efficiently is crucial. While PagedAttention has recently been proposed to improve the efficiency of memory management, we find that the growing heterogeneity in the embeddings dimensions, attention, and access patterns of modern LLM architectures introduces new challenges for memory allocation. In this paper, we present Jenga, a novel memory allocation framework for heterogeneous embeddings in LLMs. Jenga tackles two key challenges: (1) minimizing memory fragmentation when managing embeddings of different sizes, and (2) enabling flexible caching and eviction policies tailored to the specific token-dependency patterns of various layers. Jenga employs a two-level memory allocator, leveraging the least common multiple (LCM) of embedding sizes to optimize memory usage and providing APIs to express layer-specific caching logic to enhance memory reuse. We implemente Jenga on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference engine, and evaluate it with diverse LLMs, datasets, and GPU configurations. Evaluations show that Jenga improves GPU memory utilization by up to 79.6%, and increases serving throughput by up to 4.92x (1.80x on average).</p></details> | 16 pages, 19 figures |

Thus, understanding Islamophobia's global spread and online dissemination is crucial. This paper performs a large-scale analysis of specialized, semi-coded Islamophobic terms such as (muzrat, pislam, mudslime, mohammedan, muzzies) floated on extremist social platforms, i.e., 4Chan, Gab, Telegram, etc. First, we use large language models (LLMs) to show their ability to understand these terms. Second, using Google Perspective API, we also find that Islamophobic text is more toxic compared to other kinds of hate speech. Finally, we use BERT topic modeling approach to extract different topics and Islamophobic discourse on these social platforms. Our findings indicate that LLMs understand these Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) slurs; however, measures are still required to control such discourse. Our topic modeling also indicates that Islamophobic text is found across various political, conspiratorial, and far-right movements and is particularly directed against Muslim immigrants. Taken altogether, we performed the first study on Islamophobic semi-coded terms and shed a global light on Islamophobia.</p></details> |  |

While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.</p></details> |  |

In determining whether the questions written with the aid of ChatGPT were consistent with the instructor's questions and source text, we computed representative vectors of both the human and ChatGPT questions using SBERT and compared cosine similarity to the course textbook. A non-significant Mann-Whitney U test (z = 1.018, p = .309) suggests that students were unable to perceive whether questions were written with or without the aid of ChatGPT. However, student scores on LLM-authored questions were almost 9% lower (z = 2.702, p < .01). This result may indicate that either the AI questions were more difficult or that the students were more familiar with the instructor's style of questions. Overall, the study suggests that while there is potential for using LLM tools to aid in the construction of assessments, care must be taken to ensure that the questions are fair, well-composed, and relevant to the course material.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025 Technical Track on AI Alignment</p></details> |

However, setting up such simulations requires expertise in defining geometry, generating meshes, establishing boundary conditions, and configuring solvers. This research aims to simplify this process by enabling engineers to describe their setup in plain language, allowing a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the necessary input files for their specific application. This novel approach allows establishing a direct link between natural language and complex engineering tasks. Building on previous work that evaluated various LLMs for generating input files across simple and complex geometries, this study demonstrates that small LLMs - specifically, Phi-3 Mini and Qwen-2.5 1.5B - can be fine-tuned to generate precise engineering geometries in GMSH format. Through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we curated a dataset of 480 instruction-output pairs encompassing simple shapes (squares, rectangles, circles, and half circles) and more complex structures (I-beams, cylindrical pipes, and bent pipes). The fine-tuned models produced high-fidelity outputs, handling routine geometry generation with minimal intervention. While challenges remain with geometries involving combinations of multiple bodies, this study demonstrates that fine-tuned small models can outperform larger models like GPT-4o in specialised tasks, offering a precise and resource-efficient alternative for engineering applications.</p></details> | 24 pages, 17 figures |

In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021). We discuss how our interdisciplinary system could revolutionize PTSD therapy and cognitive neuroscience by enabling 24/7 monitoring, context-aware intervention, and rich data collection outside traditional labs. The vision is a future where AI-enhanced devices continuously collaborate with the human brain, offering therapeutic support and deep insights into neural function, with the resulting real-world context rich neural data, in turn, accelerating the development of more biologically-grounded and human-centric AI.</p></details> |  |

However, this increased reasoning capability also leads to excessive token generation and unnecessary problem-solving attempts. We introduce Don\'t Answer Bench (DNA Bench), a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs ability to robustly understand the tricky reasoning triggers and avoiding unnecessary generation. DNA Bench consists of 150 adversarially designed prompts that are easy for humans to understand and respond to, but surprisingly not for many of the recent prominent LLMs. DNA Bench tests models abilities across different capabilities, such as instruction adherence, hallucination avoidance, redundancy filtering, and unanswerable question recognition. We evaluate reasoning LLMs (RLMs), including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI O3-mini, Claude-3.7-sonnet and compare them against a powerful non-reasoning model, e.g., GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal that RLMs generate up to 70x more tokens than necessary, often failing at tasks that simpler non-reasoning models handle efficiently with higher accuracy. Our findings underscore the need for more effective training and inference strategies in RLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, as the scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer from accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational resources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue, we observe that complex reasoning can be achieved by solving a series of independent and self-contained subquestions. These subquestions are essentially \textit{atomic questions}, exhibiting the memoryless property similar to Markov processes. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (\our), where each state transition consists of decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a simplified question that maintains answer equivalence with the original problem. This answer preservation enables the iterative \textit{decomposition-contraction} process to naturally form a meaningful Markov reasoning process. Furthermore, these atomic states can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling \our to serve as a plug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of \our both as a standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to gpt-4o-mini, \our achieves an \textbf{80.6\%} F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by \textbf{3.4\%} and DeepSeek-R1 by \textbf{10.6\%}.

Despite its widespread use in clinical practice, it is limited by subjectivity and a lack of precision. While recent deep learning-based approaches have consistently improved classification accuracies, they often lack interpretability, hindering their utility in clinical decision-making. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AGIR, a novel pipeline consisting of a pre-trained VQ-VAE motion tokenizer and a subsequent Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned over pairs of motion tokens and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasonings. To fine-tune an LLM for pathological gait analysis, we first introduce a multimodal dataset by adding rationales dedicated to MDS-UPDRS gait score assessment to an existing PD gait dataset. We then introduce a two-stage supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy to enhance the LLM's motion comprehension with pathology-specific knowledge. This strategy includes: 1) a generative stage that aligns gait motions with analytic descriptions through bidirectional motion-description generation, 2) a reasoning stage that integrates logical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for impairment assessment with UPDRS gait score. Validation on an existing dataset and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods confirm the robustness and accuracy of our pipeline, demonstrating its ability to assign gait impairment scores from motion input with clinically meaningful rationales.</p></details> |  |

However, current alignment methods face three main limitations: (1) reliance on costly human annotation; (2) alignment tax; (3) shallow alignment vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Additionally, current alignment datasets often suffer from uneven distributions, leading to overrepresentation of some topics and neglect of others. To address these issues, we propose SRMIR (Shadow Reward Models Based on Introspective Reasoning), inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. We first construct a balanced safety Chain of Draft (CoD) dataset across $7$ harmful types with structured prompt leveraging the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs, then train a set of specialized reward models to guide policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We apply two strategies, linear combination and categorized approach, to integrate shadow reward models for policy optimization. By comparison, we find that the latter achieves superior alignment despite higher computational costs.

We assess seven leading commercial LLMs (Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7, Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2.0, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and o3-mini) using a simple tool-calling agent equipped with 23 geospatial functions. Our benchmark comprises tasks across four categories of increasing complexity, with both solvable and intentionally unsolvable tasks to test hallucination rejection. We develop an LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework to compare agent solutions against reference implementations. Results show Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o achieve the best overall performance, with Claude models excelling on solvable tasks while OpenAI models better identify unsolvable scenarios. We observe significant differences in token usage, with Anthropic models consuming substantially more tokens than competitors. Common errors include misunderstanding geometrical relationships, relying on outdated knowledge, and inefficient data manipulation. The resulting benchmark set, evaluation framework, and data generation pipeline are released as open-source resources, providing one more standardized method for ongoing evaluation of LLMs for GeoAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github with code and benchmark set: https://github.com/Solirinai/GeoBenchX</p></details> |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built upon LLMs, have demonstrated impressive potential in tackling complex tasks involving visual, auditory, and textual data. However, critical issues related to truthfulness, safety, o1-like reasoning, and alignment with human preference remain insufficiently addressed. This gap has spurred the emergence of various alignment algorithms, each targeting different application scenarios and optimization goals. Recent studies have shown that alignment algorithms are a powerful approach to resolving the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of alignment algorithms for MLLMs. Specifically, we explore four key aspects: (1) the application scenarios covered by alignment algorithms, including general image understanding, multi-image, video, and audio, and extended multimodal applications; (2) the core factors in constructing alignment datasets, including data sources, model responses, and preference annotations; (3) the benchmarks used to evaluate alignment algorithms; and (4) a discussion of potential future directions for the development of alignment algorithms.

It is an important task since it provides feedback signals to learners, and it has been demonstrated that timely feedback improves the learning process. In recent years, the irruption of LLMs has shed light on the effectiveness of automatic grading. In this paper, we explore the performance of different LLMs and prompting techniques in automatically grading short-text answers to open-ended questions. Unlike most of the literature, our study focuses on a use case where the questions, answers, and prompts are all in Spanish. Experimental results comparing automatic scores to those of human-expert evaluators show good outcomes in terms of accuracy, precision and consistency for advanced LLMs, both open and proprietary. Results are notably sensitive to prompt styles, suggesting biases toward certain words or content in the prompt. However, the best combinations of models and prompt strategies, consistently surpasses an accuracy of 95% in a three-level grading task, which even rises up to more than 98% when the it is simplified to a binary right or wrong rating problem, which demonstrates the potential that LLMs have to implement this type of automation in education applications.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical question remains: Do these mathematical reasoning abilities persist when LLMs are presented with culturally adapted math problems? Specifically, how do LLMs perform when faced with math problems embedded in cultural contexts that have no significant representation in main stream web-scale AI training data? To explore this, we generated six synthetic cultural datasets from GSM8K, a widely used benchmark for assessing LLMs' mathematical reasoning skills. While preserving the mathematical logic and numerical values of the original GSM8K test set, we modify cultural elements such as personal names, food items, place names, etc. These culturally adapted datasets provide a more reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' mathematical reasoning under shifting cultural contexts. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle with math problems when cultural references change, even though the underlying mathematical structure remains constant. Smaller models exhibit greater performance drops compared to larger models. Interestingly, our results also suggest that cultural familiarity can enhance mathematical reasoning. Even models with no explicit mathematical training but exposure to relevant cultural contexts sometimes outperform larger, mathematically proficient models on culturally embedded math problems. This study highlights the impact of cultural context on the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs, underscoring the need for more diverse and representative training data to improve robustness in real-world applications.

Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the neural network design, has been shown effective in tackling the STSF problem. However, the existing NAS methods for STSF focus on generating architectures in a time-consuming data-driven fashion, which heavily limits their ability to use background knowledge and explore the complicated search trajectory. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in decision-making with comprehensive internal world knowledge, but how it could benefit NAS for STSF remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method for STSF based on LLM. Instead of directly generate architectures with LLM, We inspire the LLM's capability with a multi-level enhancement mechanism. Specifically, on the step-level, we decompose the generation task into decision steps with powerful prompt engineering and inspire LLM to serve as instructor for architecture search based on its internal knowledge. On the instance-level, we utilize a one-step tuning framework to quickly evaluate the architecture instance and a memory bank to cumulate knowledge to improve LLM's search ability. On the task-level, we propose a two-stage architecture search, balancing the exploration stage and optimization stage, to reduce the possibility of being trapped in local optima. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive effectiveness with superior efficiency against existing NAS methods for STSF.</p></details> |  |

However, fine-tuning LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices faces significant challenges, including excessive computation overhead, device heterogeneity, and data imbalance. This paper proposes SplitFrozen, a split learning framework that enables efficient LLM fine-tuning by strategically freezing device-side model layers while centralizing parameter-efficient fine-tuning on the server. Our framework partitions LLMs into device-side frozen layers and server-side fine-tuning layers, where heterogeneous resource-constrained devices execute only forward propagation. To minimize server-side training costs, we integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the server-side layers. A pipeline parallelism strategy further optimizes training efficiency by decoupling device-server computations and leveraging decomposed backward propagation. Experiments on GPT-2 with the MRPC, MNLI-matched, and SST-2 datasets demonstrate that SplitFrozen outperforms FedLoRA and SplitLoRA by 69.4\% model accuracy under extremely imbalanced data, while reducing up to 86.8\% device-side computations and 50.2\% total training time. Experiments also validate the scalability of SplitFrozen on content generation task using Llama-3.2 model on GSM8K dataset.</p></details> |  |

This capability allows for the generation of diverse images that convey highly complex visual concepts. However, existing methods primarily focus on generating new images from text-image pairs and struggle to produce fine-grained animations from existing images and textual guidance without fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce LASER, a tuning-free LLM-driven attention control framework that follows a progressive process: LLM planning, feature-attention injection, and stable animation generation. LASER leverages a large language model (LLM) to refine general descriptions into fine-grained prompts, guiding pre-trained text-to-image models to generate aligned keyframes with subtle variations. The LLM also generates control signals for feature and attention injections, enabling seamless text-guided image morphing for various transformations without additional fine-tuning. By using the same initial noise inversion from the input image, LASER receives LLM-controlled injections during denoising and leverages interpolated text embeddings to produce a series of coherent animation frames. We propose a Text-conditioned Image-to-Animation Benchmark to validate the effectiveness and efficacy of LASER. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LASER achieves impressive results in consistent and efficient animation generation, establishing it as a powerful tool for producing detailed animations and opening new avenues in digital content creation.</p></details> |  |

Unlike robots, humans navigate not only through spatial awareness and physical distances but also by integrating external information, such as elevator maintenance updates from public notification boards and experiential knowledge, like the need for special access through certain doors. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which possesses text understanding and intelligence close to human performance, there is now an opportunity to infuse robot navigation systems with a level of understanding akin to human cognition. In this study, we propose using osmAG (Area Graph in OpensStreetMap textual format), an innovative semantic topometric hierarchical map representation, to bridge the gap between the capabilities of ROS move_base and the contextual understanding offered by LLMs. Our methodology employs LLMs as an actual copilot in robot navigation, enabling the integration of a broader range of informational inputs while maintaining the robustness of traditional robotic navigation systems.

However, the ease of achieving this similarity raises concerns from potential malicious uses at scale by bad actors, as LLM-generated text becomes increasingly difficult to discern from human text. Although detection methods have been developed to address this issue, bad actors can further manipulate LLM-generated texts to make them less detectable. In this work, we study how further editing texts with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns model outputs with human preferences, affects (a) the quality of generated texts for two tasks, and (b) the performance of LLM-generated text detectors, looking at both training-based and zero-shot detection methods. Although RLHF improves the quality of LLM-generated texts, we find that it also tends to produce more detectable, lengthy, and repetitive outputs. Additionally, we observe that training-based detectors are vulnerable to short texts and to texts that incorporate code, whereas zero-shot detectors exhibit greater robustness.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

Based on the insight that such risks can originate from trade-offs between the agent's Helpful, Harmlessness and Honest (HHH) goals, we build a novel three-stage evaluation framework, which is carefully constructed to effectively and naturally expose such risks. We conduct 14,400 agentic simulations across 12 advanced LLMs, with extensive experiments and analysis. Results reveal that LLM agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic behaviors and deception, without being deliberately induced. Furthermore, stronger reasoning abilities often increase, rather than mitigate, these risks. We also show that these agents can violate instructions and superior commands. On the whole, we empirically prove the existence of catastrophic risks in autonomous LLM agents.

Notably, LLMs like GPT-4 have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in text-to-code generation tasks. However, the growing reliance on LLMs for code generation necessitates a critical examination of the safety implications associated with their outputs. Existing research efforts have primarily focused on verifying the functional correctness of LLMs, overlooking their safety in code generation. This paper introduces a jailbreaking approach, CodeJailbreaker, designed to uncover safety concerns in LLM-based code generation. The basic observation is that existing safety mechanisms for LLMs are built through the instruction-following paradigm, where malicious intent is explicitly articulated within the instruction of the prompt. Consequently, CodeJailbreaker explores to construct a prompt whose instruction is benign and the malicious intent is implicitly encoded in a covert channel, i.e., the commit message, to bypass the safety mechanism. Experiments on the recently-released RMCBench benchmark demonstrate that CodeJailbreaker markedly surpasses the conventional jailbreaking strategy, which explicitly conveys malicious intents in the instructions, in terms of the attack effectiveness across three code generation tasks. This study challenges the traditional safety paradigms in LLM-based code generation, emphasizing the need for enhanced safety measures in safeguarding against implicit malicious cues.</p></details> |  |

However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache compression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial scenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied by the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic coherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window selection method, WindowKV. WindowKV dynamically selects local semantic windows consisting of consecutive tokens, according to task-specific characteristics, ensuring the retained KV cache captures continuous, essential context. Additionally, we introduce an intra-group layer KV cache indices sharing strategy to reduce computational overhead, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency. We rigorously evaluate WindowKV on the LongBench benchmark, and the results demonstrate that it maintains a performance comparable to full KV cache retention while using only 12% of the original KV cache, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code analysis, prevailing evaluation methodologies often lack the \textbf{context-aware robustness} necessary to capture real-world intricacies and cross-component interactions. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{VulnSage}, a comprehensive evaluation framework and a dataset curated from diverse, large-scale open-source system software projects developed in C/C++. Unlike prior datasets, it leverages a heuristic noise pre-filtering approach combined with LLM-based reasoning to ensure a representative and minimally noisy spectrum of vulnerabilities. The framework supports multi-granular analysis across function, file, and inter-function levels and employs four diverse zero-shot prompt strategies: Baseline, Chain-of-Thought, Think, and Think & Verify. Through this evaluation, we uncover that structured reasoning prompts substantially improve LLM performance, with Think & Verify reducing ambiguous responses from 20.3% to 9.1% while increasing accuracy. We further demonstrate that code-specialized models consistently outperform general-purpose alternatives, with performance varying significantly across vulnerability types, revealing that no single approach universally excels across all security contexts.

In practice, such "harmlessness" behavior is mainly achieved by training models to reject harmful requests, such as "Explain how to burn down my neighbor's house", where the model appropriately declines to respond. However, this approach can inadvertently result in false refusal, where models reject benign queries as well, such as "Tell me how to kill a Python process". In this work, we demonstrate that prompting safety reflection before generating a response can mitigate false refusal behavior. Building on this finding, we introduce the Think-Before-Refusal (TBR) schema and conduct safety-aware instruction fine-tuning incorporating safety reflection. In an ablation study across 15 pre-trained models, we show that models fine-tuned with safety reflection significantly reduce false refusal behavior while maintaining safety and overall performance compared to those fine-tuned without safety reflection.</p></details> | 18 pages, 23 figures |

But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by deliberative democracy, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI.

Existing scheduling frameworks mainly target at latency optimization while neglecting the capability of LLMs to serve different level of queries, which could lead to computational resource waste. For example, those simple queries can be safely handled by small, fast and cheap LLMs, while those complex and difficult queries need to be handled by large, slow, and expensive LLMs. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing an efficient capability-cost coordinated scheduling framework, ECCOS, for multi-LLM serving, which explicitly constrains response quality and workload to optimize LLM inference cost. Specifically, it introduces the two-stage scheduling by designing a multi-objective predictor and a constrained optimizer. The predictor estimates both model capabilities and computational costs through training-based and retrieval-based approaches, while the optimizer determines cost-optimal assignments under quality and workload constraints. It also introduces QAServe, a dataset for sample-wise response quality and costs collected by zero-shot prompting different LLMs on knowledge QA and mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ECCOS improves success rates by 6.30% while reducing costs by 10.15% compared to existing methods, consuming less than 0.5% of LLM response time.

In this situation, utilizing self-generated synthetic data has become crucial for fine-tuning LLMs without extensive human annotation. However, current methods often fail to ensure consistent improvements across iterations, with performance stagnating after only minimal updates. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Noise Preference Optimization (DNPO). DNPO employs a dynamic sample labeling mechanism to construct preference pairs for training and introduces controlled, trainable noise into the preference optimization process. Our approach effectively prevents stagnation and enables continuous improvement. In experiments with Zephyr-7B, DNPO consistently outperforms existing methods, showing an average performance boost of 2.6% across multiple benchmarks. Additionally, DNPO shows a significant improvement in model-generated data quality, with a 29.4% win-loss rate gap compared to the baseline in GPT-4 evaluations. This highlights its effectiveness in enhancing model performance through iterative refinement.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we probe the irrational behavior among contemporary LLM Agents by melding practical social science experiments with theoretical insights. Specifically, We propose CogMir, an open-ended Multi-LLM Agents framework that utilizes hallucination properties to assess and enhance LLM Agents' social intelligence through cognitive biases. Experimental results on CogMir subsets show that LLM Agents and humans exhibit high consistency in irrational and prosocial decision-making under uncertain conditions, underscoring the prosociality of LLM Agents as social entities and highlighting the significance of hallucination properties.

| **[RustMap: Towards Project-Scale C-to-Rust Migration via Program Analysis and LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17741v1)** | 2025-03-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17741v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Migrating existing C programs into Rust is increasingly desired, as Rust offers superior memory safety while maintaining C's high performance. However, vastly different features between C and Rust--e.g., distinct definitions and usages of pointers and references--pose significant challenges beyond mere syntactic translation. Existing automated translation tools, such as C2Rust, may rely too much on syntactic, template-based translation and generate unsafe Rust code that is hard for human developers to read, maintain, or even compile. More semantic-aware translation that produces safer, idiomatic, and runnable Rust code is much needed. This paper introduces a novel dependency-guided and large language model (LLM)-based C-to-Rust translation approach, RustMap, based on three key ideas: (1) Utilize LLM capabilities to produce idiomatic Rust code from given small pieces of C code, (2) Mitigate LLM limitations in handling large codebases by breaking project-scale C programs into smaller units for translation according to their usage dependencies and composing them into a runnable Rust program, and (3) Enhance the correctness of the translated Rust program by using test cases to check input/output equivalence, isolate faulty code when execution states deviate, and iteratively refine the translation using feedback from compilation and test errors. We empirically evaluate RustMap on 126 real-world programs, including 125 from Rosetta Code and a 7000+ line bzip2 implementation using GPT-4o as the LLM. RustMap shows promising results, guiding GPT-4o to produce idiomatic, readable, and functional Rust code with significantly less unsafe code than other tools, and revealing non-trivial translation patterns reusable for future research.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

However, distilled models do not match the effectiveness of their teacher LLMs. We hypothesize that this effectiveness gap is due to the fact that previous work has not applied the best-suited methods for fine-tuning cross-encoders on manually labeled data (e.g., hard-negative sampling, deep sampling, and listwise loss functions). To close this gap, we create a new dataset, Rank-DistiLLM. Cross-encoders trained on Rank-DistiLLM achieve the effectiveness of LLMs while being up to 173 times faster and 24 times more memory efficient.

In this work, we identify two key challenges contributing to this inefficiency: $\textit{over-exploration}$ due to redundant states with semantically equivalent content, and $\textit{under-exploration}$ caused by high variance in verifier scoring leading to frequent trajectory switching. To address these issues, we propose FETCH, an e$\textbf{f}$fici$\textbf{e}$nt $\textbf{t}$ree sear$\textbf{ch}$ framework, which is a flexible, plug-and-play system compatible with various tree search algorithms. Our framework mitigates over-exploration by merging semantically similar states using agglomerative clustering of text embeddings obtained from a fine-tuned SimCSE model. To tackle under-exploration, we enhance verifiers by incorporating temporal difference learning with adjusted $\lambda$-returns during training to reduce variance, and employing a verifier ensemble to aggregate scores during inference. Experiments on GSM8K, GSM-Plus, and MATH datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly improve reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency across four different tree search algorithms, paving the way for more practical applications of LLM-based reasoning.

Many LLM inference tasks rely on the same base model (e.g., LoRA). To leverage this, PipeBoost introduces fault-tolerant pipeline parallelism across both model loading and inference stages. This approach maximizes aggregate PCIe bandwidth and parallel computation across GPUs, enabling faster generation of the first token. PipeBoost also introduces recovery techniques that enable uninterrupted inference services by utilizing the shared advantages of multiple GPUs. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art low-latency LLM serving systems, PipeBoost reduces inference latency by 31% to 49.8%. For certain models (e.g., OPT-1.3B), PipeBoost achieves cold-start latencies in the range of a few hundred microseconds.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing frameworks fail to address the key step of producing output suitable for broader dissemination to the general public: while human fact-checkers communicate their findings through fact-checking articles, automated systems typically produce little or no justification for their assessments. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. We argue for the need to extend the typical automatic fact-checking pipeline with automatic generation of full fact-checking articles. We first identify key desiderata for such articles through a series of interviews with experts from leading fact-checking organizations. We then develop QRAFT, an LLM-based agentic framework that mimics the writing workflow of human fact-checkers. Finally, we assess the practical usefulness of QRAFT through human evaluations with professional fact-checkers. Our evaluation shows that while QRAFT outperforms several previously proposed text-generation approaches, it lags considerably behind expert-written articles. We hope that our work will enable further research in this new and important direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We demonstrate the versatility of OmniScience by developing a battery agent that efficiently ranks molecules as potential electrolyte solvents or additives. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that OmniScience is competitive with state-of-the-art large reasoning models on the GPQA Diamond and domain-specific battery benchmarks, while outperforming all public reasoning and non-reasoning models with similar parameter counts.

While image diffusion models have shown remarkable restoration capabilities, their direct application to video leads to temporal inconsistencies, and existing video restoration methods require extensive retraining for different degradation types. Our approach addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a hierarchical latent warping strategy that maintains consistency across both keyframes and local frames, and a hybrid token merging mechanism that adaptively combines optical flow and feature matching. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only maintains the high-quality restoration of base diffusion models but also achieves superior temporal consistency across diverse datasets and degradation conditions, including challenging scenarios like 8$\times$ super-resolution and severe noise. Importantly, our framework works with any image restoration diffusion model, providing a versatile solution for video enhancement without task-specific training or modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jimmycv07.github.io/DiffIR2VR_web/</p></details> |

Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MaRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

In this paper, we propose Fractal-IR, a fractal-based design that progressively refines degraded images by repeatedly expanding local information into broader regions. This fractal architecture naturally captures local details at early stages and seamlessly transitions toward global context in deeper fractal stages, removing the need for computationally heavy long-range self-attention mechanisms. Moveover, we observe the challenge in scaling up vision transformers for IR tasks. Through a series of analyses, we identify a holistic set of strategies to effectively guide model scaling. Extensive experimental results show that Fractal-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, denoising, JPEG artifact removal, IR in adverse weather conditions, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, and demosaicking. For $2\times$ SR on Manga109, Fractal-IR achieves a 0.21 dB PSNR gain. For grayscale image denoising on Urban100, Fractal-IR surpasses the previous method by 0.2 dB for $\sigma=50$.</p></details> |  |

These methods typically flatten 2D images into multiple distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, process each sequence independently using selective scan operation, and recombine them to form the outputs. However, such a paradigm overlooks two vital aspects: i) the local relationships and spatial continuity inherent in natural images, and ii) the discrepancies among sequences unfolded through totally different ways. To overcome the drawbacks, we explore two problems in Mamba-based restoration methods: i) how to design a scanning strategy preserving both locality and continuity while facilitating restoration, and ii) how to aggregate the distinct sequences unfolded in totally different ways. To address these problems, we propose a novel Mamba-based Image Restoration model (MaIR), which consists of Nested S-shaped Scanning strategy (NSS) and Sequence Shuffle Attention block (SSA). Specifically, NSS preserves locality and continuity of the input images through the stripe-based scanning region and the S-shaped scanning path, respectively. SSA aggregates sequences through calculating attention weights within the corresponding channels of different sequences. Thanks to NSS and SSA, MaIR surpasses 40 baselines across 14 challenging datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of image super-resolution, denoising, deblurring and dehazing.

The Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) offers a promising alternative by initializing the generative process from corrupted images while leveraging training techniques from score-based diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce the Implicit Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^3$SB) to further accelerate the generative process of I$^2$SB. I$^3$SB restructures the generative process into a non-Markovian framework by incorporating the initial corrupted image at each generative step, effectively preserving and utilizing its information. To enable direct use of pretrained I$^2$SB models without additional training, we ensure consistency in marginal distributions. Extensive experiments across many image corruptions, including noise, low resolution, JPEG compression, and sparse sampling, and multiple image modalities, such as natural, human face, and medical images, demonstrate the acceleration benefits of I$^3$SB. Compared to I$^2$SB, I$^3$SB achieves the same perceptual quality with fewer generative steps, while maintaining or improving fidelity to the ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, accepted by Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

However, most existing methods address only a single type of degradation (e.g., blur, noise, or haze) at a time, limiting their real-world applicability where multiple degradations often occur simultaneously. In this paper, we propose UniCoRN, a unified image restoration approach capable of handling multiple degradation types simultaneously using a multi-head diffusion model. Specifically, we uncover the potential of low-level visual cues extracted from images in guiding a controllable diffusion model for real-world image restoration and we design a multi-head control network adaptable via a mixture-of-experts strategy. We train our model without any prior assumption of specific degradations, through a smartly designed curriculum learning recipe. Additionally, we also introduce MetaRestore, a metalens imaging benchmark containing images with multiple degradations and artifacts. Extensive evaluations on several challenging datasets, including our benchmark, demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gains and can robustly restore images with severe degradations.

In contrast, both camera RAW and high dynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, in which color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light. While training on commonly available display-encoded images is a well-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In this work, we test several approaches on three popular image restoration applications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. We examine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using popular transfer functions (PQ, PU21, and mu-law), or whether it is better to train in linear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptual non-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantly better on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, which offer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to the training strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, between 2 and 9 dB.</p></details> |  |

Existing Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) offer stable restoration performance but require manual selection of degradation matrices for each degradation type, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenarios. To address this issue, we propose the Vision-Language-guided Unfolding Network (VLU-Net), a unified DUN framework for handling multiple degradation types simultaneously. VLU-Net leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) refined on degraded image-text pairs to align image features with degradation descriptions, selecting the appropriate transform for target degradation. By integrating an automatic VLM-based gradient estimation strategy into the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, VLU-Net effectively tackles complex multi-degradation restoration tasks while maintaining interpretability. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical feature unfolding structure to enhance VLU-Net framework, efficiently synthesizing degradation patterns across various levels. VLU-Net is the first all-in-one DUN framework and outperforms current leading one-by-one and all-in-one end-to-end methods by 3.74 dB on the SOTS dehazing dataset and 1.70 dB on the Rain100L deraining dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed.

PnP Langevin sampling algorithms offer a powerful framework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as well as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and visualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model parameter tuning. However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |

However, the current implementation of UDC causes serious degradation. The incident light required for camera imaging undergoes attenuation and diffraction when passing through the display panel, leading to various artifacts in UDC imaging. Presently, the prevailing UDC image restoration methods predominantly utilize convolutional neural network architectures, whereas Transformer-based methods have exhibited superior performance in the majority of image restoration tasks. This is attributed to the Transformer's capability to sample global features for the local reconstruction of images, thereby achieving high-quality image restoration. In this paper, we observe that when using the Vision Transformer for UDC degraded image restoration, the global attention samples a large amount of redundant information and noise. Furthermore, compared to the ordinary Transformer employing dense attention, the Transformer utilizing sparse attention can alleviate the adverse impact of redundant information and noise. Building upon this discovery, we propose a Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer method (SGSFormer) for the task of restoring high-quality images from UDC degraded images. Specifically, we utilize sparse self-attention to filter out redundant information and noise, directing the model's attention to focus on the features more relevant to the degraded regions in need of reconstruction. Moreover, we integrate the instance segmentation map as prior information to guide the sparse self-attention in filtering and focusing on the correct regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, conference or other essential info</p></details> |

However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images. We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next, we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects, achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we tackle image restoration from a different perspective by jointly denoising multiple photographs of the same scene. Our core hypothesis is that degraded images capturing a shared scene contain complementary information that, when combined, better constrains the restoration problem. To this end, we implement a powerful multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates uncorrupted views by extracting rich information from multi-view relationships. Our experiments show that our multi-view approach outperforms existing single-view image and even video-based methods on image deblurring and super-resolution tasks. Critically, our model is trained to output 3D consistent images, making it a promising tool for applications requiring robust multi-view integration, such as 3D reconstruction or pose estimation.</p></details> |  |

The structure of the perturbations is investigated depending on the acceptable PSNR values and based on the Fourier power spectrum computations for the perturbations. It is demonstrated that moderate variation of image brightness ($\sim 10$ pixel units in a restricted region of an image can result in VMAF growth by $\sim 60\%$). Unlike some other methods demonstrating similar VMAF growth, the subjective quality of an image remains almost unchanged. It is also shown that the adversarial perturbations may demonstrate approximately linear dependence of perturbation amplitudes on the image brightness. The perturbations are studied based on the direct VMAF optimization in PyTorch. The significant discrepancies between the metric values and subjective judgements are also demonstrated when image restoration from noise is carried out using the same direct VMAF optimization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 40 figures |

Specifically, PPTformer contains two parts: an Image Restoration Network (IRNet) for restoring images from degraded observations and a Parser-Prompted Feature Generation Network (PPFGNet) for providing IRNet with reliable parser information to boost restoration. To enhance the integration of the parser within IRNet, we propose Intra Parser-Prompted Attention (IntraPPA) and Inter Parser-Prompted Attention (InterPPA) to implicitly and explicitly learn useful parser features to facilitate restoration. The IntraPPA re-considers cross attention between parser and restoration features, enabling implicit perception of the parser from a long-range and intra-layer perspective. Conversely, the InterPPA initially fuses restoration features with those of the parser, followed by formulating these fused features within an attention mechanism to explicitly perceive parser information. Further, we propose a parser-prompted feed-forward network to guide restoration within pixel-wise gating modulation. Experimental results show that PPTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on image deraining, defocus deblurring, desnowing, and low-light enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is accepted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

However, rapid scans often result in poor image quality, potentially affecting diagnosis due to reduced resolution and detail, which make it challenging to identify and evaluate finer anatomical structures. To address this issue, we propose the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance rapid bone scintigraphy images in pediatric populations. Our method comprises two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, augmented by three key modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules incorporate domain-specific semantic information from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM maintains consistent semantic feature representation throughout the cascaded networks. In addition, we will release a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset called RBS, the first dataset dedicated to rapid bone scintigraphy image restoration in pediatric patients. RBS consists of 137 pediatric patients aged between 0.5 and 16 years who underwent both standard and rapid bone scans. The dataset includes scans performed at 20 cm/min (standard) and 40 cm/min (rapid), representing a $2\times$ acceleration. We conducted extensive experiments on both the publicly available endoscopic dataset and RBS.

To cope with these challenges, we analyze the restoration process in depth through a progressive spectral perspective, and deconstruct the complex UHD restoration problem into three progressive stages: zero-frequency enhancement, low-frequency restoration, and high-frequency refinement. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, ERR, which comprises three collaborative sub-networks: the zero-frequency enhancer (ZFE), the low-frequency restorer (LFR), and the high-frequency refiner (HFR). Specifically, the ZFE integrates global priors to learn global mapping, while the LFR restores low-frequency information, emphasizing reconstruction of coarse-grained content. Finally, the HFR employs our designed frequency-windowed kolmogorov-arnold networks (FW-KAN) to refine textures and details, producing high-quality image restoration. Our approach significantly outperforms previous UHD methods across various tasks, with extensive ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we introduce ABAIR, a simple yet effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration model that not only handles multiple degradations and generalizes well to unseen distortions but also efficiently integrates new degradations by training only a small subset of parameters. We first train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations. To enhance its ability to recognize distortions, we incorporate a segmentation head that estimates per-pixel degradation types. Second, we adapt our initial model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. This specialize-then-merge approach is both powerful in addressing specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks. Moreover, our model not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance on five- and three-task IR setups but also demonstrates superior generalization to unseen degradations and composite distortions.</p></details> | 17 pages |

While many specialized and all-in-one IR models have been developed, they fail to effectively handle complex, mixed degradations. Recent agentic methods RestoreAgent and AgenticIR leverage intelligent, autonomous workflows to alleviate this issue, yet they suffer from suboptimal results and inefficiency due to their resource-intensive finetunings, and ineffective searches and tool execution trials for satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose MAIR, a novel Multi-Agent approach for complex IR problems. We introduce a real-world degradation prior, categorizing degradations into three types: (1) scene, (2) imaging, and (3) compression, which are observed to occur sequentially in real world, and reverse them in the opposite order. Built upon this three-stage restoration framework, MAIR emulates a team of collaborative human specialists, including a "scheduler" for overall planning and multiple "experts" dedicated to specific degradations. This design minimizes search space and trial efforts, improving image quality while reducing inference costs. In addition, a registry mechanism is introduced to enable easy integration of new tools. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that proposed MAIR achieves competitive performance and improved efficiency over the previous agentic IR system.

Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space. However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks with only 1M parameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional scanners achieve this by scanning at multiple focal planes of varying depths and then merging them, which is relatively slow and often struggles with complex tissue defocus. Recent prevailing image restoration technique provides a means to restore high-quality pathology images from scans of single focal planes. However, existing image restoration methods are inadequate, due to intricate defocus patterns in pathology images and their domain-specific semantic complexities. In this work, we devise a two-stage restoration solution cascading a transformer and a diffusion model, to benefit from their powers in preserving image fidelity and perceptual quality, respectively. We particularly propose a novel mixture of prompts for the two-stage solution. Given initial prompt that models defocus in microscopic imaging, we design two prompts that describe the high-level image semantics from pathology foundation model and the fine-grained tissue structures via edge extraction. We demonstrate that, by feeding the prompt mixture to our method, we can restore high-quality pathology images from single-focal-plane scans, implying high potentials of the mixture of prompts to clinical usage.

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity.

This leads to insufficient interaction for unprofessional users and limits their restoration capability for complicated real-world applications. In this work, we present HybridAgent, intending to incorporate multiple restoration modes into a unified image restoration model and achieve intelligent and efficient user interaction through our proposed hybrid agents. Concretely, we propose the hybrid rule of fast, slow, and feedback restoration agents. Here, the slow restoration agent optimizes the powerful multimodal large language model (MLLM) with our proposed instruction-tuning dataset to identify degradations within images with ambiguous user prompts and invokes proper restoration tools accordingly. The fast restoration agent is designed based on a lightweight large language model (LLM) via in-context learning to understand the user prompts with simple and clear requirements, which can obviate the unnecessary time/resource costs of MLLM. Moreover, we introduce the mixed distortion removal mode for our HybridAgents, which is crucial but not concerned in previous agent-based works. It can effectively prevent the error propagation of step-by-step image restoration and largely improve the efficiency of the agent system. We validate the effectiveness of HybridAgent with both synthetic and real-world IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, images captured by diverse sensors often encounter various degradations that can negatively affect fusion quality. Traditional fusion methods generally treat image enhancement and fusion as separate processes, overlooking the inherent correlation between them; notably, the dominant regions in one modality of a fused image often indicate areas where the other modality might benefit from enhancement. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the concept of dominant regions for image enhancement and present a Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent framework for Image Fusion (Dream-IF). This framework quantifies the relative dominance of each modality across different layers and leverages this information to facilitate reciprocal cross-modal enhancement. By integrating the relative dominance derived from image fusion, our approach supports not only image restoration but also a broader range of image enhancement applications. Furthermore, we employ prompt-based encoding to capture degradation-specific details, which dynamically steer the restoration process and promote coordinated enhancement in both multi-modal image fusion and image enhancement scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Dream-IF consistently outperforms its counterparts.</p></details> |  |

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of No-Reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders the assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (Cross-Reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new Cross-Reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate Cross-Reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose MP-HSIR, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an innovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key components: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related information and context-aware representations into the network to guide restoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable input-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving adaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism, after the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge with constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free concepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration process. Therefore, we can form a cyclic "Prompt-Restore-Prompt" pipeline that adeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable textures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at: https://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Super-Resolution (QUIET-SR), a hybrid framework that extends the Swin transformer architecture with a novel shifted quantum window attention mechanism, built upon variational quantum neural networks. QUIET-SR effectively captures complex residual mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution images, leveraging quantum attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and image restoration while requiring a minimal number of qubits, making it suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.

However, extending these approaches to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration is challenging due to the domain gap between RGB and HSI features, information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation patterns via text prompts. In this paper, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework that addresses these challenges. By incorporating frequency-aware feature modulation, which utilizes frequency analysis to narrow down the restoration search space and employing vision-language model (VLM)-guided prompt learning, our approach decomposes text prompts into intensity and bias controllers that effectively guide the restoration process while mitigating domain discrepancies.

| **[Boosting Diffusion-Based Text Image Super-Resolution Model Towards Generalized Real-World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07232v2)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.07232v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Restoring low-resolution text images presents a significant challenge, as it requires maintaining both the fidelity and stylistic realism of the text in restored images. Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by even 0.35dB PSNR for lightweight SR even with 9.3\% less parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by up to 0.29dB.

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradation specific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms state-of-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/mrluin/UniRestorer.</p></details> | 30 pages, 20 figures |

Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches struggle with addressing complex and ambiguously defined degradation types. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic degradation decomposition network for all-in-one image restoration, named D$^3$Net. D$^3$Net achieves degradation-adaptive image restoration with guided prompt through cross-domain interaction and dynamic degradation decomposition. Concretely, in D$^3$Net, the proposed Cross-Domain Degradation Analyzer (CDDA) engages in deep interaction between frequency domain degradation characteristics and spatial domain image features to identify and model variations of different degradation types on the image manifold, generating degradation correction prompt and strategy prompt, which guide the following decomposition process. Furthermore, the prompt-based Dynamic Decomposition Mechanism (DDM) for progressive degradation decomposition, that encourages the network to adaptively select restoration strategies utilizing the two-level prompt generated by CDDA. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation between CDDA and DDM, D$^3$Net achieves superior flexibility and scalability in handling unknown degradation, while effectively reducing unnecessary computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple image restoration tasks demonstrate that D$^3$Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, especially improving PSNR by 5.47dB and 3.30dB on the SOTS-Outdoor and GoPro datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Our evaluation reveals a critical gap: existing approaches consistently fail on severely degraded videos--precisely where diffusion models' generative capabilities are most needed. We identify that existing diffusion-based VSR methods struggle primarily because they face an overwhelming learning burden: simultaneously modeling complex degradation distributions, content representations, and temporal relationships with limited high-quality training data. To address this fundamental challenge, we present DiffVSR, featuring a Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS) that systematically decomposes this learning burden through staged training, enabling superior performance on complex degradations. Our framework additionally incorporates an Interweaved Latent Transition (ILT) technique that maintains competitive temporal consistency without additional training overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in scenarios where competing methods struggle, particularly on severely degraded videos. Our work reveals that addressing the learning strategy, rather than focusing solely on architectural complexity, is the critical path toward robust real-world video super-resolution with diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xh9998.github.io/DiffVSR-project/</p></details> |

They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.

Under such scenarios, traditional frame-based cameras may fail to capture the structure and color information due to the exposure time limitation. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event cameras' high dynamic range is pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing traditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments. In this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional frame-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that combine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based low-light image restoration framework named ERetinex. Among our contributions, the first is developing a new approach that leverages the high temporal resolution data from event cameras with traditional image information to estimate scene illumination accurately. This method outperforms traditional image-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more precise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion strategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the color information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this fusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the integrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a gain of 1.0613 dB in PSNR while reducing FLOPS by \textbf{84.28}\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, this enhanced contrast comes at the cost of system complexity, constrained by an inherent trade-off between spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and imaging speed. To overcome this limitation, we present a deep learning-based approach that restores and enhances pixel resolution post-acquisition without any a priori knowledge. Fine-tuned using metrics aligned with the imaging model, our physics-aware method achieves a 16X pixel super-resolution enhancement and a 12X imaging speedup without the need of additional training data for transfer learning. Applied to both synthetic and experimental data from five different sample types, we demonstrate that the model preserves biological integrity, ensuring no features are lost or hallucinated. We also concretely demonstrate the model's ability to reveal disease-associated metabolic changes in Downs syndrome that would otherwise remain undetectable. Furthermore, we provide physical insights into the inner workings of the model, paving the way for future refinements that could potentially surpass instrumental limits in an explainable manner.

Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Most existing deweathering methods rely on increasing the network scale and data volume to achieve better performance which requires more expensive computing power. Also, many methods lack generalization for specific applications. In the traffic surveillance screener, the main challenges are snow removal and veil effect elimination. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-enhanced snow removal method that use a Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform feature enhancement module and a dynamic convolution acceleration module to address snow degradation in surveillance images. We also use a residual learning restoration module to remove veil effects caused by rain, snow, and fog. The proposed architecture extracts and analyzes information from snow-covered regions, significantly improving snow removal performance. And the residual learning restoration module removes veiling effects in images, enhancing clarity and detail. Experiments show that it performs better than some popular desnowing methods. Our approach also demonstrates effectiveness and accuracy when applied to real traffic surveillance images.</p></details> |  |

More recently, a sampling-based variant of this approach, which utilizes a pre-trained \textit{generative diffusion model}, has gained great popularity for solving IR problems through stochastic sampling. The IR results using PnP with a pre-trained diffusion model demonstrate distinct advantages compared to those using discriminative denoisers, \ie improved perceptual quality while sacrificing the data fidelity. The unsatisfactory results are due to the lack of integration of these strategies in the IR tasks. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot IR scheme, dubbed Reconciling Diffusion Model in Dual (RDMD), which leverages only a \textbf{single} pre-trained diffusion model to construct \textbf{two} complementary regularizers. Specifically, the diffusion model in RDMD will iteratively perform deterministic denoising and stochastic sampling, aiming to achieve high-fidelity image restoration with appealing perceptual quality. RDMD also allows users to customize the distortion-perception tradeoff with a single hyperparameter, enhancing the adaptability of the restoration process in different practical scenarios.

State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Moreover, typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization.

In this paper, we propose a relatively lightweight Adapter that leverages the powerful generative capabilities of pretrained priors to achieve photo-realistic image restoration. The Adapters can be adapt to both denoising UNet and DiT, and performs excellent.</p></details> |  |

Accurately quantifying this uncertainty is essential for the reliable interpretation of reconstructed images. However, image restoration methods often lack uncertainty quantification capabilities. Conformal prediction offers a rigorous framework to augment image restoration methods with accurate uncertainty quantification estimates, but it typically requires abundant ground truth data for calibration. This paper presents a self-supervised conformal prediction method for Poisson imaging problems which leverages Poisson Unbiased Risk Estimator to eliminate the need for ground truth data. The resulting self-calibrating conformal prediction approach is applicable to any Poisson linear imaging problem that is ill-conditioned, and is particularly effective when combined with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques trained directly on measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring; its performance are comparable to supervised conformal prediction methods relying on ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most convolutional neural network-based methods typically focus on a single scale, neglecting the incorporation of multi-scale information. In image restoration tasks, local features of an image are often insufficient, necessitating the integration of global features to complement them. Although recent neural network algorithms have made significant strides in feature extraction, many models do not explicitly model global features or consider the relationship between global and local features. This paper proposes multi-level attention-guided graph neural network. The proposed network explicitly constructs element block graphs and element graphs within feature maps using multi-attention mechanisms to extract both local structural features and global representation information of the image. Since the network struggles to effectively extract global information during image degradation, the structural information of local feature blocks can be used to correct and supplement the global information. Similarly, when element block information in the feature map is missing, it can be refined using global element representation information. The graph within the network learns real-time dynamic connections through the multi-attention mechanism, and information is propagated and aggregated via graph convolution algorithms. By combining local element block information and global element representation information from the feature map, the algorithm can more effectively restore missing information in the image. Experimental results on several classic image restoration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Building on the insight that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new dual-transformer approach comprising two components: a frequency-aware Degradation estimation transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing the input into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in five representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring, and low-light enhancement. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling, real-world degradations, spatially variant degradations, and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics.

The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025.

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Restoration can be seen as a controllable generation conditioning on priors. However, due to the severity of image degradation, existing diffusion-based restoration methods cannot fully exploit priors from low-quality images and still have many challenges in perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and structure accuracy. Based on the challenges, we introduce a novel image restoration method, SSP-IR. Our approach aims to fully exploit semantic and structure priors from low-quality images to guide the diffusion model in generating semantically faithful and structurally accurate natural restoration results. Specifically, we integrate the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (explicit) and the visual representations of the original image (implicit) to acquire accurate semantic prior. To extract degradation-independent structure prior, we introduce a Processor with RGB and FFT constraints to extract structure prior from the low-quality images, guiding the diffusion model and preventing the generation of unreasonable artifacts. Lastly, we employ a multi-level attention mechanism to integrate the acquired semantic and structure priors. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods overall on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo are available at https://ddcm-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for reliably interpreting experimental results, particularly when reconstructed images inform critical decisions and science. However, most existing image restoration methods either fail to quantify uncertainty or provide estimates that are highly inaccurate. Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a flexible framework to equip any estimator with uncertainty quantification capabilities that, by construction, have nearly exact marginal coverage. To achieve this, conformal prediction relies on abundant ground truth data for calibration. However, in image restoration problems, reliable ground truth data is often expensive or not possible to acquire. Also, reliance on ground truth data can introduce large biases in situations of distribution shift between calibration and deployment. This paper seeks to develop a more robust approach to conformal prediction for image restoration problems by proposing a self-supervised conformal prediction method that leverages Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to self-calibrate itself directly from the observed noisy measurements, bypassing the need for ground truth. The method is suitable for any linear imaging inverse problem that is ill-conditioned, and it is especially powerful when used with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques that can also be trained directly from measurement data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring, where it delivers results that are remarkably accurate and comparable to those obtained by supervised conformal prediction with ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing image compression methods are tailored for clean images, therefore struggling to achieve satisfying results on these images. Joint compression and restoration methods typically focus on a single type of degradation and fail to address a variety of degradations in practice. To this end, we propose a unified framework for all-in-one image compression and restoration, which incorporates the image restoration capability against various degradations into the process of image compression. The key challenges involve distinguishing authentic image content from degradations, and flexibly eliminating various degradations without prior knowledge. Specifically, the proposed framework approaches these challenges from two perspectives: i.e., content information aggregation, and degradation representation aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior rate-distortion (RD) performance on various degraded inputs while preserving the performance on clean data; 2) strong generalization ability to real-world and unseen scenarios; 3) higher computing efficiency over compared methods.

This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR operates in latent space by first predicting the latent representation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and then transporting this estimate to high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. Consequently, ELIR is more than 4x faster compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches. Moreover, ELIR is also more than 4x smaller, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks show that ELIR achieves competitive results, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while offering improved efficiency in terms of memory and computation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

Toward this end, we present MorphoMod, a novel method for automated visible watermark removal that operates in a blind setting -- without requiring target images. Unlike existing methods, MorphoMod effectively removes opaque and transparent watermarks while preserving semantic content, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including the Colored Large-scale Watermark Dataset (CLWD), LOGO-series, and the newly introduced Alpha1 datasets, demonstrate that MorphoMod achieves up to a 50.8% improvement in watermark removal effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the impact of prompts used for inpainting, pre-removal filling strategies, and inpainting model performance on watermark removal. Additionally, a case study on steganographic disorientation reveals broader applications for watermark removal in disrupting high-level hidden messages. MorphoMod offers a robust, adaptable solution for watermark removal and opens avenues for further advancements in image restoration and adversarial manipulation.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Traditional ``Shape from X'' tasks usually use visual input (e.g., RGB images or depth maps) to reconstruct geometry, imposing strict constraints that limit creative explorations. As applications, works like Shadow Art and Wire Art often struggle to grasp the embedded semantics of their design through direct observation and rely heavily on specific setups for proper display. To address these limitations, our framework uses semantics as input, greatly expanding the design space to create objects that integrate multiple semantic elements and are easily discernible by observers. Considering that this task requires a rich imagination, we adopt various generative models and structure-to-detail pipelines. Specifically, we adopt multi-semantics Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill 3D geometry and appearance from 2D diffusion models, ensuring that the initial shape is consistent with the semantic input. We then use image restoration and video generation models to add more details as supervision. Finally, we introduce neural signed distance field (SDF) representation to achieve detailed shape reconstruction.

However, Mamba currently lags behind Transformers in contextual learning capabilities. To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data. In the Transformer module, we combine triangular window-based local attention with channel-based global attention to effectively activate the attention mechanism over a wider range of image pixels.

However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information. The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction.

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception Block} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmarks for image super-resolution, deraining, and low-light image enhancement demonstrate that TAMambaIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency, establishing it as a robust and efficient framework for image restoration.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.</p></details> |  |

Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color artifacts in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a balance of regularization terms on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color artifacts reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,14figures |

Unlike the existing self-supervised pre-training methods, DCPT utilizes the degradation type of the input image as an extremely weak supervision, which can be effortlessly obtained, even intrinsic in all image restoration datasets. DCPT comprises two primary stages. Initially, image features are extracted from the encoder. Subsequently, a lightweight decoder, such as ResNet18, is leveraged to classify the degradation type of the input image solely based on the features extracted in the first stage, without utilizing the input image. The encoder is pre-trained with a straightforward yet potent DCPT, which is used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Following DCPT, both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrate performance improvements, with gains of up to 2.55 dB in the 10D all-in-one restoration task and 6.53 dB in the mixed degradation scenarios. Moreover, previous self-supervised pretraining methods, such as masked image modeling, discard the decoder after pre-training, while our DCPT utilizes the pre-trained parameters more effectively. This superiority arises from the degradation classifier acquired during DCPT, which facilitates transfer learning between models of identical architecture trained on diverse degradation types.

Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors. We share the software implementation at https://github.com/meteahishali/R2C-GAN.</p></details> |  |

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

While denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated notable success in tasks like image synthesis and restoration, traditional DDPMs rely on continuous data representations and mean squared error (MSE) loss for training, applying Gaussian noise models that may not be optimal for discrete or binary data structures. BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets. Notably, BDPM requires fewer inference steps than traditional DDPM models to reach optimal results, showcasing enhanced inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Existing dehazing models often neglect compression effects, which limits their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions. First, we design FDG-Diff, a novel frequency-domain-guided dehazing framework that improves JPEG image restoration by leveraging frequency-domain information. Second, we introduce the High-Frequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequency-domain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the Degradation-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive region-specific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation inconsistencies in compressed hazy images. Experimental results across multiple compressed dehazing datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches.

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> |  |

This task is typically addressed while being given only degraded images, without their corresponding ground-truth versions. In this hard setting, designing and evaluating restoration algorithms becomes highly challenging. This paper offers a suite of tools that can serve both the design and assessment of real-world image restoration algorithms. Our work starts by proposing a trained model that predicts the chain of degradations a given real-world measured input has gone through. We show how this estimator can be used to approximate the consistency -- the match between the measurements and any proposed recovered image. We also use this estimator as a guiding force for the design of a simple and highly-effective plug-and-play real-world image restoration algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained diffusion-based image prior. Furthermore, this work proposes no-reference proxy measures of MSE and LPIPS, which, without access to the ground-truth images, allow ranking of real-world image restoration algorithms according to their (approximate) MSE and LPIPS. The proposed suite provides a versatile, first of its kind framework for evaluating and comparing blind image restoration algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://man-sean.github.io/elad-website/</p></details> |

Diffusion models are the newcomers to this arena, posing the strongest known prior to date. Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of image restoration tasks and datasets, achieving significant improvements over prior art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://ronraphaeli.github.io/SILO-website/</p></details> |

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

The application of DM in stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need to reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally, existing latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove high-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is precisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we propose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image restoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo first learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is then trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are fused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing beneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The resolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the inherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates the computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding scheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling distinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network. Comprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and transformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information.

To address this, we propose a Soft Knowledge Distillation (SKD) strategy that incorporates a Multi-dimensional Cross-net Attention (MCA) mechanism for compressing image restoration models. This mechanism facilitates interaction between the student and teacher across both channel and spatial dimensions, enabling the student to implicitly learn the attention matrices. Additionally, we employ a Gaussian kernel function to measure the distance between student and teacher features in kernel space, ensuring stable and efficient feature learning. To further enhance the quality of reconstructed images, we replace the commonly used L1 or KL divergence loss with a contrastive learning loss at the image level. Experiments on three tasks-image deraining, deblurring, and denoising-demonstrate that our SKD strategy significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining strong image restoration capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

SLKD employs a dual-teacher, single-student architecture with two distinct learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and Image Reconstruction Learning (IRL), simultaneously. In DRL, the student encoder learns from Teacher A to focus on removing degradation factors, guided by a novel BRISQUE extractor. In IRL, the student decoder learns from Teacher B to reconstruct clean images, with the assistance of a proposed PIQE extractor. These strategies enable the student to learn from degraded and clean images simultaneously, ensuring high-quality compression of image restoration models.

Existing approaches, such as Puppet-Master, rely on fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models, which are impractical for real-world use due to the limitations of 2D video representation and slow processing times. To overcome these challenges, we present PartRM, a novel 4D reconstruction framework that simultaneously models appearance, geometry, and part-level motion from multi-view images of a static object. PartRM builds upon large 3D Gaussian reconstruction models, leveraging their extensive knowledge of appearance and geometry in static objects. To address data scarcity in 4D, we introduce the PartDrag-4D dataset, providing multi-view observations of part-level dynamics across over 20,000 states. We enhance the model's understanding of interaction conditions with a multi-scale drag embedding module that captures dynamics at varying granularities. To prevent catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning, we implement a two-stage training process that focuses sequentially on motion and appearance learning. Experimental results show that PartRM establishes a new state-of-the-art in part-level motion learning and can be applied in manipulation tasks in robotics. Our code, data, and models are publicly available to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

This is notably true for real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich environments. Our approach, BrainNRDS (Brain-Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli), leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli; (2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity. BrainNRDS advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems.

Existing methods lack a systematic way to reliably extract the interpretable underlying intrinsic concepts. To address this challenge, we present ICE, short for Intrinsic Concept Extraction, a novel framework that exclusively utilizes a T2I model to automatically and systematically extract intrinsic concepts from a single image. ICE consists of two pivotal stages. In the first stage, ICE devises an automatic concept localization module to pinpoint relevant text-based concepts and their corresponding masks within the image. This critical stage streamlines concept initialization and provides precise guidance for subsequent analysis. The second stage delves deeper into each identified mask, decomposing the object-level concepts into intrinsic concepts and general concepts. This decomposition allows for a more granular and interpretable breakdown of visual elements. Our framework demonstrates superior performance on intrinsic concept extraction from a single image in an unsupervised manner.

However, without additional guidance, the large motion between frames makes this problem ill-posed. Event-based Video Frame Interpolation (EVFI) addresses this challenge by using sparse, high-temporal-resolution event measurements as motion guidance. This guidance allows EVFI methods to significantly outperform frame-only methods. However, to date, EVFI methods have relied on a limited set of paired event-frame training data, severely limiting their performance and generalization capabilities. In this work, we overcome the limited data challenge by adapting pre-trained video diffusion models trained on internet-scale datasets to EVFI. We experimentally validate our approach on real-world EVFI datasets, including a new one that we introduce. Our method outperforms existing methods and generalizes across cameras far better than existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Although this evolution has significantly enhanced the models' ability to understand complex prompts and generate text, it also leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters. Despite T5 series encoders being trained on the C4 natural language corpus, which includes a significant amount of non-visual data, diffusion models with T5 encoder do not respond to those non-visual prompts, indicating redundancy in representational power. Therefore, it raises an important question: "Do we really need such a large text encoder?" In pursuit of an answer, we employ vision-based knowledge distillation to train a series of T5 encoder models. To fully inherit its capabilities, we constructed our dataset based on three criteria: image quality, semantic understanding, and text-rendering. Our results demonstrate the scaling down pattern that the distilled T5-base model can generate images of comparable quality to those produced by T5-XXL, while being 50 times smaller in size. This reduction in model size significantly lowers the GPU requirements for running state-of-the-art models such as FLUX and SD3, making high-quality text-to-image generation more accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Aesthetic Post-Training Diffusion Models from Generic Preferences with Step-by-step Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04314v3)** | 2025-03-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.04314v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating visually appealing images is fundamental to modern text-to-image generation models. A potential solution to better aesthetics is direct preference optimization (DPO), which has been applied to diffusion models to improve general image quality including prompt alignment and aesthetics. Popular DPO methods propagate preference labels from clean image pairs to all the intermediate steps along the two generation trajectories. However, preference labels provided in existing datasets are blended with layout and aesthetic opinions, which would disagree with aesthetic preference. Even if aesthetic labels were provided (at substantial cost), it would be hard for the two-trajectory methods to capture nuanced visual differences at different steps. To improve aesthetics economically, this paper uses existing generic preference data and introduces step-by-step preference optimization (SPO) that discards the propagation strategy and allows fine-grained image details to be assessed. Specifically, at each denoising step, we 1) sample a pool of candidates by denoising from a shared noise latent, 2) use a step-aware preference model to find a suitable win-lose pair to supervise the diffusion model, and 3) randomly select one from the pool to initialize the next denoising step. This strategy ensures that diffusion models focus on the subtle, fine-grained visual differences instead of layout aspect. We find that aesthetics can be significantly enhanced by accumulating these improved minor differences. When fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL, SPO yields significant improvements in aesthetics compared with existing DPO methods while not sacrificing image-text alignment compared with vanilla models. Moreover, SPO converges much faster than DPO methods due to the use of more correct preference labels provided by the step-aware preference model.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

However, they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing. To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM. FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process. Specifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the VLM by introducing additional region tokens. Relying solely on the output of the LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results. Therefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module. The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings. The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image. By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing methods.

Meanwhile, within language, emotion plays a crucial role in expressing personal opinions in our daily lives and the inclusion of maliciously negative content can lead users astray, exacerbating negative emotions. Recognizing the success of diffusion models and the significance of emotion, we investigate a previously overlooked risk associated with text-to-image diffusion models, that is, utilizing emotion in the input texts to introduce negative content and provoke unfavorable emotions in users. Specifically, we identify a new backdoor attack, i.e., emotion-aware backdoor attack (EmoAttack), which introduces malicious negative content triggered by emotional texts during image generation. We formulate such an attack as a diffusion personalization problem to avoid extensive model retraining and propose the EmoBooth. Unlike existing personalization methods, our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained diffusion model by establishing a mapping between a cluster of emotional words and a given reference image containing malicious negative content. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we built a dataset and conducted extensive analysis and discussion about its effectiveness. Given consumers' widespread use of diffusion models, uncovering this threat is critical for society.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unpaired Object-Level SAR-to-Optical Image Translation for Aircraft with Keypoints-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19798v1)** | 2025-03-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.19798v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery provides all-weather, all-day, and high-resolution imaging capabilities but its unique imaging mechanism makes interpretation heavily reliant on expert knowledge, limiting interpretability, especially in complex target tasks. Translating SAR images into optical images is a promising solution to enhance interpretation and support downstream tasks. Most existing research focuses on scene-level translation, with limited work on object-level translation due to the scarcity of paired data and the challenge of accurately preserving contour and texture details. To address these issues, this study proposes a keypoint-guided diffusion model (KeypointDiff) for SAR-to-optical image translation of unpaired aircraft targets. This framework introduces supervision on target class and azimuth angle via keypoints, along with a training strategy for unpaired data. Based on the classifier-free guidance diffusion architecture, a class-angle guidance module (CAGM) is designed to integrate class and angle information into the diffusion generation process. Furthermore, adversarial loss and consistency loss are employed to improve image fidelity and detail quality, tailored for aircraft targets. During sampling, aided by a pre-trained keypoint detector, the model eliminates the requirement for manually labeled class and azimuth information, enabling automated SAR-to-optical translation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across multiple metrics, providing an efficient and effective solution for object-level SAR-to-optical translation and downstream tasks. Moreover, the method exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to untrained aircraft types with the assistance of the keypoint detector.</p></details> |  |

However, the task of 3D gaming map art creation remains underexplored to date due to its unique complexity and domain-specific challenges. While recent works have addressed related topics such as retro-style level generation and procedural terrain creation, these works primarily focus on simpler data distributions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the application of modern AI techniques for high-resolution texture manipulation in complex, highly detailed AAA 3D game environments. We introduce a novel Smart Brush for map editing, designed to assist artists in seamlessly modifying selected areas of a game map with minimal effort. By leveraging generative adversarial networks and diffusion models we propose two variants of the brush that enable efficient and context-aware generation. Our hybrid workflow aims to enhance both artistic flexibility and production efficiency, enabling the refinement of environments without manually reworking every detail, thus helping to bridge the gap between automation and creative control in game development. A comparative evaluation of our two methods with adapted versions of several state-of-the art models shows that our GAN-based brush produces the sharpest and most detailed outputs while preserving image context while the evaluated state-of-the-art models tend towards blurrier results and exhibit difficulties in maintaining contextual consistency.</p></details> |  |

Current methods aimed at safeguarding artworks often employ adversarial attacks. However, these methods face challenges such as poor transferability, high computational costs, and the introduction of noticeable noise, which compromises the aesthetic quality of the original artwork. To address these limitations, we propose a Structurally Imperceptible and Transferable Adversarial (SITA) attacks. SITA leverages a CLIP-based destylization loss, which decouples and disrupts the robust style representation of the image. This disruption hinders style extraction during stylized image generation, thereby impairing the overall stylization process. Importantly, SITA eliminates the need for a surrogate diffusion model, leading to significantly reduced computational overhead. The method's robust style feature disruption ensures high transferability across diverse models. Moreover, SITA introduces perturbations by embedding noise within the imperceptible structural details of the image. This approach effectively protects against style extraction without compromising the visual quality of the artwork. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SITA offers superior protection for artworks against unauthorized use in stylized generation. It significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of transferability, computational efficiency, and noise imperceptibility.

FADE comprises two components: (1) the Concept Neighborhood, which identifies an adjacency set of related concepts, and (2) Mesh Modules, employing a structured combination of Expungement, Adjacency, and Guidance loss components. These enable precise erasure of target concepts while preserving fidelity across related and unrelated concepts. Evaluated on datasets like Stanford Dogs, Oxford Flowers, CUB, I2P, Imagenette, and ImageNet1k, FADE effectively removes target concepts with minimal impact on correlated concepts, achieving atleast a 12% improvement in retention performance over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Our approach addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a hierarchical latent warping strategy that maintains consistency across both keyframes and local frames, and a hybrid token merging mechanism that adaptively combines optical flow and feature matching. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only maintains the high-quality restoration of base diffusion models but also achieves superior temporal consistency across diverse datasets and degradation conditions, including challenging scenarios like 8$\times$ super-resolution and severe noise.

To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, they still face slow generation speeds due to sequential denoising processes. To address this, a parallel sampling method based on Picard iteration was introduced, effectively reducing sequential steps while ensuring exact convergence to the original output. Nonetheless, Picard iteration does not guarantee faster convergence, which can still result in slow generation in practice. In this work, we propose a new parallelization scheme, the Picard Consistency Model (PCM), which significantly reduces the number of generation steps in Picard iteration. Inspired by the consistency model, PCM is directly trained to predict the fixed-point solution, or the final output, at any stage of the convergence trajectory. Additionally, we introduce a new concept called model switching, which addresses PCM's limitations and ensures exact convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCM achieves up to a 2.71x speedup over sequential sampling and a 1.77x speedup over Picard iteration across various tasks, including image generation and robotic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Manual annotation demands significant resources, faces ethical constraints, and depends heavily on domain expertise. Existing generative models often target single-modality outputs, either images or segmentation masks, failing to address the need for high-quality, simultaneous image-mask generation. Additionally, these models frequently lack adaptable conditioning mechanisms, restricting control over the generated outputs and limiting their applicability for dataset augmentation and rare scenario simulation. We propose CoSimGen, a diffusion-based framework for controllable simultaneous image and mask generation. Conditioning is intuitively achieved through (1) text prompts grounded in class semantics, (2) spatial embedding of context prompts to provide spatial coherence, and (3) spectral embedding of timestep information to model noise levels during diffusion. To enhance controllability and training efficiency, the framework incorporates contrastive triplet loss between text and class embeddings, alongside diffusion and adversarial losses. Initial low-resolution outputs 128 x 128 are super-resolved to 512 x 512, producing high-fidelity images and masks with strict adherence to conditions. We evaluate CoSimGen on metrics such as FID, KID, LPIPS, Class FID, Positive predicted value for image fidelity and semantic alignment of generated samples over 4 diverse datasets.

In response to this challenge, we define a new benchmark, the OpenSDI dataset (OpenSDID), which stands out from existing datasets due to its diverse use of large vision-language models that simulate open-world diffusion-based manipulations. Another outstanding feature of OpenSDID is its inclusion of both detection and localization tasks for images manipulated globally and locally by diffusion models. To address the OpenSDI challenge, we propose a Synergizing Pretrained Models (SPM) scheme to build up a mixture of foundation models. This approach exploits a collaboration mechanism with multiple pretrained foundation models to enhance generalization in the OpenSDI context, moving beyond traditional training by synergizing multiple pretrained models through prompting and attending strategies. Building on this scheme, we introduce MaskCLIP, an SPM-based model that aligns Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) with Masked Autoencoder (MAE). Extensive evaluations on OpenSDID show that MaskCLIP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for the OpenSDI challenge, achieving remarkable relative improvements of 14.23% in IoU (14.11% in F1) and 2.05% in accuracy (2.38% in F1) compared to the second-best model in localization and detection tasks, respectively.

Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion (HED) introduces a structured entropy-based anomaly classification mechanism that systematically tracks fluctuations in entropy evolution to differentiate between benign cryptographic processes and unauthorized encryption attempts. The integration of hierarchical clustering, entropy profiling, and probabilistic diffusion modeling refines detection granularity, ensuring that encryption anomalies are identified despite obfuscation strategies or incremental execution methodologies. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that HED maintained high classification accuracy across diverse ransomware families, outperforming traditional heuristic-based and signature-driven approaches while reducing false positive occurrences. Comparative analysis highlighted that entropy-driven anomaly segmentation improved detection efficiency under variable system workload conditions, ensuring real-time classification feasibility. The computational overhead associated with entropy anomaly detection remained within operational constraints, reinforcing the suitability of entropy-driven classification for large-scale deployment. The ability to identify adversarial entropy manipulations before encryption completion contributes to broader cybersecurity defenses, offering a structured methodology for isolating unauthorized cryptographic activities within heterogeneous computing environments. The results further emphasized that entropy evolution modeling facilitates predictive anomaly detection, enhancing resilience against encryption evasion techniques designed to circumvent traditional detection mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

In this context, we propose a Generative Implicit Video Compression framework, GIViC, aiming at advancing the performance limits of this type of coding methods. GIViC is inspired by the characteristics that INRs share with large language and diffusion models in exploiting long-term dependencies. Through the newly designed implicit diffusion process, GIViC performs diffusive sampling across coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal decompositions, gradually progressing from coarser-grained full-sequence diffusion to finer-grained per-token diffusion. A novel Hierarchical Gated Linear Attention-based transformer (HGLA), is also integrated into the framework, which dual-factorizes global dependency modeling along scale and sequential axes. The proposed GIViC model has been benchmarked against SOTA conventional and neural codecs using a Random Access (RA) configuration (YUV 4:2:0, GOPSize=32), and yields BD-rate savings of 15.94%, 22.46% and 8.52% over VVC VTM, DCVC-FM and NVRC, respectively. As far as we are aware, GIViC is the first INR-based video codec that outperforms VTM based on the RA coding configuration. The source code will be made available.</p></details> |  |

The algorithm is rooted in Bayesian posterior sampling: it combines a likelihood model enforcing fidelity to the reverberant measurement, and an anechoic speech prior implemented by an unconditional diffusion model. We design a parametric filter representing the RIR, with exponential decay for each frequency subband. Room acoustics estimation and speech dereverberation are jointly carried out, as the filter parameters are iteratively estimated and the speech utterance refined along the reverse diffusion trajectory. In a blind scenario where the RIR is unknown, BUDDy successfully performs speech dereverberation in various acoustic scenarios, significantly outperforming other blind unsupervised baselines. Unlike supervised methods, which often struggle to generalize, BUDDy seamlessly adapts to different acoustic conditions. This paper extends our previous work by offering new experimental results and insights into the algorithm's versatility. We demonstrate the robustness of our proposed method to new acoustic and speaker conditions, as well as its adaptability to high-resolution singing voice dereverberation, using both instrumental metrics and subjective listening evaluation. We study BUDDy's performance for RIR estimation and observe it surpasses a state-of-the-art supervised DNN-based estimator on mismatched acoustic conditions.

To address this, we propose StarGen, a novel framework that employs a pre-trained video diffusion model in an autoregressive manner for long-range scene generation. The generation of each video clip is conditioned on the 3D warping of spatially adjacent images and the temporally overlapping image from previously generated clips, improving spatiotemporal consistency in long-range scene generation with precise pose control. The spatiotemporal condition is compatible with various input conditions, facilitating diverse tasks, including sparse view interpolation, perpetual view generation, and layout-conditioned city generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate StarGen's superior scalability, fidelity, and pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, their iterative sampling processes often result in slow inference speeds, limiting their application in real-time tasks. To address this challenge, we propose the latent consistency model for super-resolution (LCMSR), a novel single-step diffusion approach designed to enhance both efficiency and visual quality in RSISR tasks. Our proposal is structured into two distinct stages. In the first stage, we pretrain a residual autoencoder to encode the differential information between high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) images, transitioning the diffusion process into a latent space to reduce computational costs. The second stage focuses on consistency diffusion learning, which aims to learn the distribution of residual encodings in the latent space, conditioned on LR images. The consistency constraint enforces that predictions at any two timesteps along the reverse diffusion trajectory remain consistent, enabling direct mapping from noise to data. As a result, the proposed LCMSR reduces the iterative steps of traditional diffusion models from 50-1000 or more to just a single step, significantly improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that LCMSR effectively balances efficiency and performance, achieving inference times comparable to non-diffusion models while maintaining high-quality output.</p></details> |  |

Existing GAN-based methods suffer from either distortions and visual artifacts or poor reconstruction quality, i.e., the background and several important appearance details, such as hair style/color, glasses and accessories, are not faithfully reconstructed. Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) enable the generation of high-quality realistic images. To this end, in this paper we present DiffusionAct, a novel method that leverages the photo-realistic image generation of diffusion models to perform neural face reenactment. Specifically, we propose to control the semantic space of a Diffusion Autoencoder (DiffAE), in order to edit the facial pose of the input images, defined as the head pose orientation and the facial expressions. Our method allows one-shot, self, and cross-subject reenactment, without requiring subject-specific fine-tuning. We compare against state-of-the-art GAN-, StyleGAN2-, and diffusion-based methods, showing better or on-par reenactment performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://stelabou.github.io/diffusionact/</p></details> |

However, recent methods primarily focus on rooftops from aerial images, often overlooking essential geometrical details. Additionally, there is a notable lack of datasets containing complete 3D point clouds for entire buildings, along with challenges in obtaining reliable camera pose information for aerial images. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel methodology, AIM2PC , which utilizes our generated dataset that includes complete 3D point clouds and determined camera poses. Our approach takes features from a single aerial image as input and concatenates them with essential additional conditions, such as binary masks and Sobel edge maps, to enable more edge-aware reconstruction. By incorporating a point cloud diffusion model based on Centered denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (CDPM), we project these concatenated features onto the partially denoised point cloud using our camera poses at each diffusion step. The proposed method is able to reconstruct the complete 3D building point cloud, including wall information and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing baseline techniques.

By allowing tokens and experts to compete together and select the top candidates, the model learns to dynamically assign experts to critical tokens. Additionally, we propose per-layer regularization to address challenges in shallow layer learning, and router similarity loss to prevent mode collapse, ensuring better expert utilization.

We propose a plug-and-play training-free alignment method, DyMO, for aligning the generated images and human preferences during inference. Apart from text-aware human preference scores, we introduce a semantic alignment objective for enhancing the semantic alignment in the early stages of diffusion, relying on the fact that the attention maps are effective reflections of the semantics in noisy images. We propose dynamic scheduling of multiple objectives and intermediate recurrent steps to reflect the requirements at different steps. Experiments with diverse pre-trained diffusion models and metrics demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, their iterative denoising nature requires a large number of inference steps to generate a video, which is slow and computationally expensive. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis of the challenges present in existing diffusion distillation methods and propose a novel efficient method, namely AccVideo, to reduce the inference steps for accelerating video diffusion models with synthetic dataset. We leverage the pretrained video diffusion model to generate multiple valid denoising trajectories as our synthetic dataset, which eliminates the use of useless data points during distillation. Based on the synthetic dataset, we design a trajectory-based few-step guidance that utilizes key data points from the denoising trajectories to learn the noise-to-video mapping, enabling video generation in fewer steps. Furthermore, since the synthetic dataset captures the data distribution at each diffusion timestep, we introduce an adversarial training strategy to align the output distribution of the student model with that of our synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing the video quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves 8.5x improvements in generation speed compared to the teacher model while maintaining comparable performance. Compared to previous accelerating methods, our approach is capable of generating videos with higher quality and resolution, i.e., 5-seconds, 720x1280, 24fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aejion.github.io/accvideo/</p></details> |

Recent methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve enhanced ToF denoising accuracy but tend to struggle when presented with severe noise corruption due to limited prior knowledge of ToF data distribution. In this paper, we propose DepthCAD, a novel ToF denoising approach that ensures global structural smoothness by leveraging the rich prior knowledge in Stable Diffusion and maintains local metric accuracy by steering the diffusion process with confidence guidance. To adopt the pretrained image diffusion model to ToF depth denoising, we apply the diffusion on raw ToF correlation measurements with dynamic range normalization before converting to depth maps. Experimental results validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed scheme, and the evaluation on real data further verifies its robustness against real-world ToF noise.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel speed-up method for diffusion model training, called, which is based on a closer look at time steps. Our key findings are: i) Time steps can be empirically divided into acceleration, deceleration, and convergence areas based on the process increment. ii) These time steps are imbalanced, with many concentrated in the convergence area. iii) The concentrated steps provide limited benefits for diffusion training. To address this, we design an asymmetric sampling strategy that reduces the frequency of steps from the convergence area while increasing the sampling probability for steps from other areas. Additionally, we propose a weighting strategy to emphasize the importance of time steps with rapid-change process increments. As a plug-and-play and architecture-agnostic approach, SpeeD consistently achieves 3-times acceleration across various diffusion architectures, datasets, and tasks. Notably, due to its simple design, our approach significantly reduces the cost of diffusion model training with minimal overhead. Our research enables more researchers to train diffusion models at a lower cost.</p></details> |  |

This phenomenon, known as memorization, may lead to copyright issues. In this study, we propose a method to quantify the ease of reproducing training data in unconditional diffusion models. The average of a sample population following the Langevin equation in the reverse diffusion process moves according to a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE establishes a 1-to-1 correspondence between images and their noisy counterparts in the latent space. Since the ODE is reversible and the initial noisy images are sampled randomly, the volume of an image's projected area represents the probability of generating those images. We examined the ODE, which projects images to latent space, and succeeded in quantifying the ease of reproducing training data by measuring the volume growth rate in this process. Given the relatively low computational complexity of this method, it allows us to enhance the quality of training data by detecting and modifying the easily memorized training samples.</p></details> |  |

However, they still face significant challenges in accurately capturing spatial details of radar images, particularly in regions of high precipitation intensity. This limitation results in reduced spatial localization accuracy when predicting radar echo images across varying precipitation intensities. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative precipitation prediction approach termed the Multi-Task Latent Diffusion Model (MTLDM). The core idea of MTLDM lies in the recognition that precipitation radar images represent a combination of multiple components, each corresponding to different precipitation intensities. Thus, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing radar images into several sub-images based on their precipitation intensities and individually modeling these components. During the prediction stage, MTLDM integrates these sub-image representations by utilizing a trained latent-space rainfall diffusion model, followed by decoding through a multi-task decoder to produce the final precipitation prediction. Experimental evaluations conducted on the MRMS dataset demonstrate that the proposed MTLDM method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a Critical Success Index (CSI) improvement of 13-26%.</p></details> | 15 pages, 14figures |

Despite human hand synthesis already being an intricate problem, generating objects in contact with hands and their interactions presents an even more challenging task, especially when the objects exhibit obvious variations in size and shape. To tackle these issues, we present a novel video Reenactment framework focusing on Human-Object Interaction (HOI) via an adaptive Layout-instructed Diffusion model (Re-HOLD). Our key insight is to employ specialized layout representation for hands and objects, respectively. Such representations enable effective disentanglement of hand modeling and object adaptation to diverse motion sequences. To further improve the generation quality of HOI, we design an interactive textural enhancement module for both hands and objects by introducing two independent memory banks. We also propose a layout adjustment strategy for the cross-object reenactment scenario to adaptively adjust unreasonable layouts caused by diverse object sizes during inference. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods.

Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we enhance video diffusion models by allowing motion control via structured latent noise sampling. This is achieved by just a change in data: we pre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models.

However, they often lack explicit control over head movements and facial expressions, and cannot produce videos from multiple viewpoints, resulting in less controllable and expressive animations. Moreover, text-guided portrait animation remains underexplored, despite its user-friendly nature. We present a novel two-stage text-guided framework, MVPortrait (Multi-view Vivid Portrait), to generate expressive multi-view portrait animations that faithfully capture the described motion and emotion. MVPortrait is the first to introduce FLAME as an intermediate representation, effectively embedding facial movements, expressions, and view transformations within its parameter space. In the first stage, we separately train the FLAME motion and emotion diffusion models based on text input. In the second stage, we train a multi-view video generation model conditioned on a reference portrait image and multi-view FLAME rendering sequences from the first stage. Experimental results exhibit that MVPortrait outperforms existing methods in terms of motion and emotion control, as well as view consistency. Furthermore, by leveraging FLAME as a bridge, MVPortrait becomes the first controllable portrait animation framework that is compatible with text, speech, and video as driving signals.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

In this regard, we present DeClotH, which separately reconstructs 3D cloth and human body from a single image. This task remains largely unexplored due to the extreme occlusion between cloth and the human body, making it challenging to infer accurate geometries and textures. Moreover, while recent 3D human reconstruction methods have achieved impressive results using text-to-image diffusion models, directly applying such an approach to this problem often leads to incorrect guidance, particularly in reconstructing 3D cloth. To address these challenges, we propose two core designs in our framework. First, to alleviate the occlusion issue, we leverage 3D template models of cloth and human body as regularizations, which provide strong geometric priors to prevent erroneous reconstruction by the occlusion. Second, we introduce a cloth diffusion model specifically designed to provide contextual information about cloth appearance, thereby enhancing the reconstruction of 3D cloth.

To do this, previous approaches have typically relied on text-to-image (T2I) generative models to produce pairs of original and edited images that simulate the input/output of an instruction-guided image-editing model. However, these image pairs often fail to align with the specified edit instructions due to the limitations of T2I models, which negatively impacts models trained on such datasets. To address this, we present Instruct-CLIP (I-CLIP), a selfsupervised method that learns the semantic changes between original and edited images to refine and better align the instructions in existing datasets. Furthermore, we adapt Instruct-CLIP to handle noisy latent images and diffusion timesteps so that it can be used to train latent diffusion models (LDMs) and efficiently enforce alignment between the edit instruction and the image changes in latent space at any step of the diffusion pipeline. We use Instruct-CLIP to correct the InstructPix2Pix dataset and get over 120K refined samples we then use to fine-tune their model, guided by our novel I-CLIP-based loss function.

However, these methods may struggle with maintaining structural integrity and recovering the anomaly-free content of abnormal regions, especially in multi-class scenarios. Furthermore, diffusion models are inherently designed to generate images from pure noise and struggle to selectively alter anomalous regions of an image while preserving normal ones. This leads to potential degradation of normal regions during reconstruction, hampering the effectiveness of anomaly detection. This paper introduces a reformulation of the standard diffusion model geared toward selective region alteration, allowing the accurate identification of anomalies. By modeling anomalies as noise in the latent space, our proposed \textbf{Deviation correction diffusion} (\Ours) model preserves the normal regions and encourages transformations exclusively on anomalous areas. This selective approach enhances the reconstruction quality, facilitating effective unsupervised detection and localization of anomaly regions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method in accurately identifying and localizing anomalies in complex images, with pixel-level AUPRC improvements of 11-14\% over state-of-the-art models on well known anomaly detection datasets.

In particular, diffusion models represent fine-scale details without spatial smoothing, which is crucial for mesoscale predictions, such as heavy rainfall forecasting. However, the applications of diffusion models to mesoscale prediction remain limited. To address this gap, this study proposes an architecture that combines a diffusion model with Swin-Unet as a deterministic model, achieving mesoscale predictions while maintaining flexibility. The proposed architecture trains the two models independently, allowing the diffusion model to remain unchanged when the deterministic model is updated. Comparisons using the Fractions Skill Score and power spectral analysis demonstrate that incorporating the diffusion model leads to improved accuracy compared to predictions without it.

Existing diffusion models struggle with scaling beyond their training resolutions, often leading to structural distortions or content repetition. Reference-based methods address the issues by upsampling a low-resolution reference to guide higher-resolution generation. However, they face significant challenges: upsampling in latent space often causes manifold deviation, which degrades output quality. On the other hand, upsampling in RGB space tends to produce overly smoothed outputs. To overcome these limitations, LSRNA combines Latent space Super-Resolution (LSR) for manifold alignment and Region-wise Noise Addition (RNA) to enhance high-frequency details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating LSRNA outperforms state-of-the-art reference-based methods across various resolutions and metrics, while showing the critical role of latent space upsampling in preserving detail and sharpness.

To reduce the data requirements, a natural solution is to leverage existing data-free static avatar generation methods, such as pre-trained diffusion models with score distillation sampling (SDS), which align avatars with pseudo ground-truth outputs from the diffusion model. However, directly distilling 4D avatars from video diffusion often leads to over-smooth results due to spatial and temporal inconsistencies in the generated video. To address this issue, we propose Zero-1-to-A, a robust method that synthesizes a spatial and temporal consistency dataset for 4D avatar reconstruction using the video diffusion model. Specifically, Zero-1-to-A iteratively constructs video datasets and optimizes animatable avatars in a progressive manner, ensuring that avatar quality increases smoothly and consistently throughout the learning process. This progressive learning involves two stages: (1) Spatial Consistency Learning fixes expressions and learns from front-to-side views, and (2) Temporal Consistency Learning fixes views and learns from relaxed to exaggerated expressions, generating 4D avatars in a simple-to-complex manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Zero-1-to-A improves fidelity, animation quality, and rendering speed compared to existing diffusion-based methods, providing a solution for lifelike avatar creation.

We introduce BADGR, a novel diffusion model that jointly performs reconstruction and bundle adjustment (BA) to refine poses and layouts from a coarse state, using 1D floor boundary predictions from dozens of images of varying input densities. Unlike a guided diffusion model, BADGR is conditioned on dense per-entity outputs from a single-step Levenberg Marquardt (LM) optimizer and is trained to predict camera and wall positions while minimizing reprojection errors for view-consistency. The objective of layout generation from denoising diffusion process complements BA optimization by providing additional learned layout-structural constraints on top of the co-visible features across images. These constraints help BADGR to make plausible guesses on spatial relations which help constrain pose graph, such as wall adjacency, collinearity, and learn to mitigate errors from dense boundary observations with global contexts. BADGR trains exclusively on 2D floor plans, simplifying data acquisition, enabling robust augmentation, and supporting variety of input densities. Our experiments and analysis validate our method, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art pose and floor plan layout reconstruction with different input densities.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the commonly studied scenarios involving a single human or hand interacting with one object, we address a more generic multi-body setting with arbitrary numbers of humans, hands, and objects. This complexity introduces significant challenges in synchronizing motions due to the high correlations and mutual influences among bodies. To address these challenges, we introduce SyncDiff, a novel method for multi-body interaction synthesis using a synchronized motion diffusion strategy. SyncDiff employs a single diffusion model to capture the joint distribution of multi-body motions. To enhance motion fidelity, we propose a frequency-domain motion decomposition scheme. Additionally, we introduce a new set of alignment scores to emphasize the synchronization of different body motions. SyncDiff jointly optimizes both data sample likelihood and alignment likelihood through an explicit synchronization strategy. Extensive experiments across four datasets with various multi-body configurations demonstrate the superiority of SyncDiff over existing state-of-the-art motion synthesis methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present GameFactory, a framework for action-controlled scene-generalizable game video generation. We first address the fundamental challenge of action controllability by introducing GF-Minecraft, a action-annotated game video dataset without human bias, and developing a action control module that enables precise control over both keyboard and mouse inputs. We further extend to support autoregressive generation for unlimited-length interactive videos. More importantly, GameFactory tackles the critical challenge of scene-generalizable action control, which most existing methods fail to address. To enable the creation of entirely new and diverse games beyond fixed styles and scenes, we leverage the open-domain generative priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. To bridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game datasets, we propose a multi-phase training strategy with a domain adapter that decouples game style learning from action control. This decoupling ensures that action control learning is no longer bound to specific game styles, thereby achieving scene-generalizable action control. Experimental results demonstrate that GameFactory effectively generates open-domain action-controllable game videos, representing a significant step forward in AI-driven game generation.

Recently, consistency models have demonstrated impressive performance, achieving results on par with diffusion models in the pixel space. However, the success of scaling consistency training to large-scale datasets, particularly for text-to-image and video generation tasks, is determined by performance in the latent space. In this work, we analyze the statistical differences between pixel and latent spaces, discovering that latent data often contains highly impulsive outliers, which significantly degrade the performance of iCT in the latent space. To address this, we replace Pseudo-Huber losses with Cauchy losses, effectively mitigating the impact of outliers. Additionally, we introduce a diffusion loss at early timesteps and employ optimal transport (OT) coupling to further enhance performance. Lastly, we introduce the adaptive scaling-$c$ scheduler to manage the robust training process and adopt Non-scaling LayerNorm in the architecture to better capture the statistics of the features and reduce outlier impact. With these strategies, we successfully train latent consistency models capable of high-quality sampling with one or two steps, significantly narrowing the performance gap between latent consistency and diffusion models.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates topological constraints into a diffusion model to improve the generation of realistic, contextually accurate cell topologies. Our method refines the simulation of cell distributions and interactions, increasing the precision and interpretability of results in downstream tasks such as cell detection and classification.

This paper investigates different variations of diffusion modeling for unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection. In particular, we find that Denoising Diffusion Probability Models (DDPM) are performant on anomaly detection benchmarks yet computationally expensive. By simplifying DDPM in application to anomaly detection, we are naturally led to an alternative approach called Diffusion Time Estimation (DTE). DTE estimates the distribution over diffusion time for a given input and uses the mode or mean of this distribution as the anomaly score. We derive an analytical form for this density and leverage a deep neural network to improve inference efficiency. Through empirical evaluations on the ADBench benchmark, we demonstrate that all diffusion-based anomaly detection methods perform competitively for both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. Notably, DTE achieves orders of magnitude faster inference time than DDPM, while outperforming it on this benchmark. These results establish diffusion-based anomaly detection as a scalable alternative to traditional methods and recent deep-learning techniques for standard unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Based on these unified representations, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</p></details> | preprint |

After pre-training on enormous unlabeled data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a zeroth-order informed fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The zeroth-order gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with the lower variance than other methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of the RLR. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation tasks to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.</p></details> |  |

Despite achieving comparable results to sophisticated handcrafted camera ISP solutions, existing learning-based methods still struggle with detail disparity and color distortion. In this paper, we present ISPDiffuser, a diffusion-based decoupled framework that separates the RAW-to-sRGB mapping into detail reconstruction in grayscale space and color consistency mapping from grayscale to sRGB. Specifically, we propose a texture-aware diffusion model that leverages the generative ability of diffusion models to focus on local detail recovery, in which a texture enrichment loss is further proposed to prompt the diffusion model to generate more intricate texture details. Subsequently, we introduce a histogram-guided color consistency module that utilizes color histogram as guidance to learn precise color information for grayscale to sRGB color consistency mapping, with a color consistency loss designed to constrain the learned color information. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed ISPDiffuser outperforms state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually.

Moreover, restoring heavily distorted information under dense haze requires generative diffusion models, whose potential in dehazing remains underutilized partly due to their lengthy sampling processes. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel hazing-dehazing pipeline consisting of a Realistic Hazy Image Generation framework (HazeGen) and a Diffusion-based Dehazing framework (DiffDehaze). Specifically, HazeGen harnesses robust generative diffusion priors of real-world hazy images embedded in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. By employing specialized hybrid training and blended sampling strategies, HazeGen produces realistic and diverse hazy images as high-quality training data for DiffDehaze. To alleviate the inefficiency and fidelity concerns associated with diffusion-based methods, DiffDehaze adopts an Accelerated Fidelity-Preserving Sampling process (AccSamp). The core of AccSamp is the Tiled Statistical Alignment Operation (AlignOp), which can provide a clean and faithful dehazing estimate within a small fraction of sampling steps to reduce complexity and enable effective fidelity guidance.

Given that it is infeasible to directly train a model on 'whole' images from domains with potential gigapixel sizes, diffusion-based generative methods have focused on synthesizing small, fixed-size patches extracted from these images. However, generating small patches has limited applicability since patch-based models fail to capture the global structures and wider context of large images, which can be crucial for synthesizing (semantically) accurate samples. To overcome this limitation, we present ZoomLDM, a diffusion model tailored for generating images across multiple scales. Central to our approach is a novel magnification-aware conditioning mechanism that utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings and allows the diffusion model to synthesize images at different 'zoom' levels, i.e., fixed-size patches extracted from large images at varying scales. ZoomLDM synthesizes coherent histopathology images that remain contextually accurate and detailed at different zoom levels, achieving state-of-the-art image generation quality across all scales and excelling in the data-scarce setting of generating thumbnails of entire large images. The multi-scale nature of ZoomLDM unlocks additional capabilities in large image generation, enabling computationally tractable and globally coherent image synthesis up to $4096 \times 4096$ pixels and $4\times$ super-resolution. Additionally, multi-scale features extracted from ZoomLDM are highly effective in multiple instance learning experiments.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose BEVDiffuser, a novel diffusion model that effectively denoises BEV feature maps using the ground-truth object layout as guidance. BEVDiffuser can be operated in a plug-and-play manner during training time to enhance existing BEV models without requiring any architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate BEVDiffuser's exceptional denoising and generation capabilities, which enable significant enhancement to existing BEV models, as evidenced by notable improvements of 12.3\% in mAP and 10.1\% in NDS achieved for 3D object detection without introducing additional computational complexity.

The target is defined by a segmentation mask and the desired action is described via a text prompt. Unlike existing controllable image-to-video diffusion models that often rely on dense structural or motion cues to guide the actor's movements toward the target, our target-aware model requires only a simple mask to indicate the target, leveraging the generalization capabilities of pretrained models to produce plausible actions. This makes our method particularly effective for human-object interaction (HOI) scenarios, where providing precise action guidance is challenging, and further enables the use of video diffusion models for high-level action planning in applications such as robotics. We build our target-aware model by extending a baseline model to incorporate the target mask as an additional input. To enforce target awareness, we introduce a special token that encodes the target's spatial information within the text prompt. We then fine-tune the model with our curated dataset using a novel cross-attention loss that aligns the cross-attention maps associated with this token with the input target mask. To further improve performance, we selectively apply this loss to the most semantically relevant transformer blocks and attention regions. Experimental results show that our target-aware model outperforms existing solutions in generating videos where actors interact accurately with the specified targets.

This computational burden primarily arises from the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video resolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality or necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are pre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these low-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading performance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free framework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead while preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high denoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and final stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To mitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution transition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage. We evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where extensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to 3$\times$ for image generation and 2.5$\times$ for video generation, all while maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling process across multiple evaluation metrics.

Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models have led to significant progress in texture generation. Most existing research approaches this task by first generating images in 2D spaces using image diffusion models, followed by a texture baking process to achieve UV texture. However, these methods often struggle to produce high-quality textures due to inconsistencies among the generated multi-view images, resulting in seams and ghosting artifacts. In contrast, 3D-based texture synthesis methods aim to address these inconsistencies, but they often neglect 2D diffusion model priors, making them challenging to apply to real-world objects To overcome these limitations, we propose RomanTex, a multiview-based texture generation framework that integrates a multi-attention network with an underlying 3D representation, facilitated by our novel 3D-aware Rotary Positional Embedding. Additionally, we incorporate a decoupling characteristic in the multi-attention block to enhance the model's robustness in image-to-texture task, enabling semantically-correct back-view synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a geometry-related Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) mechanism to further improve the alignment with both geometries and images. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with comprehensive user studies, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in texture quality and consistency.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a multi-modal framework for Synchronous Video Prediction (SyncVP) that incorporates complementary data modalities, enhancing the richness and accuracy of future predictions. SyncVP builds on pre-trained modality-specific diffusion models and introduces an efficient spatio-temporal cross-attention module to enable effective information sharing across modalities. We evaluate SyncVP on standard benchmark datasets, such as Cityscapes and BAIR, using depth as an additional modality. We furthermore demonstrate its generalization to other modalities on SYNTHIA with semantic information and ERA5-Land with climate data. Notably, SyncVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in scenarios where only one modality is present, demonstrating its robustness and potential for a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |

Artificial intelligence has the potential to enhance this process. However, the limited availability of embryo data presents challenges for training deep learning models. To address this, we trained two generative models using two datasets-one we created and made publicly available, and one existing public dataset-to generate synthetic embryo images at various cell stages, including 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula, and blastocyst. These were combined with real images to train classification models for embryo cell stage prediction. Our results demonstrate that incorporating synthetic images alongside real data improved classification performance, with the model achieving 97% accuracy compared to 94.5% when trained solely on real data. This trend remained consistent when tested on an external Blastocyst dataset from a different clinic. Notably, even when trained exclusively on synthetic data and tested on real data, the model achieved a high accuracy of 92%. Furthermore, combining synthetic data from both generative models yielded better classification results than using data from a single generative model. Four embryologists evaluated the fidelity of the synthetic images through a Turing test, during which they annotated inaccuracies and offered feedback. The analysis showed the diffusion model outperformed the generative adversarial network, deceiving embryologists 66.6% versus 25.3% and achieving lower Frechet inception distance scores.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly diffusion models, have improved accelerated MRI reconstruction. However, existing diffusion models' training often relies on fully sampled data, models incur high computational costs, and often lack uncertainty estimation, limiting their clinical applicability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework, called Dual-domain Multi-path Self-supervised Diffusion Model (DMSM), that integrates a self-supervised dual-domain diffusion model training scheme, a lightweight hybrid attention network for the reconstruction diffusion model, and a multi-path inference strategy, to enhance reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. Unlike traditional diffusion-based models, DMSM eliminates the dependency on training from fully sampled data, making it more practical for real-world clinical settings. We evaluated DMSM on two human MRI datasets, demonstrating that it achieves favorable performance over several supervised and self-supervised baselines, particularly in preserving fine anatomical structures and suppressing artifacts under high acceleration factors. Additionally, our model generates uncertainty maps that correlate reasonably well with reconstruction errors, offering valuable clinically interpretable guidance and potentially enhancing diagnostic confidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Existing omnimatte methods assume a static background or accurate pose and depth estimation and produce poor decompositions when these assumptions are violated. Furthermore, due to the lack of generative prior on natural videos, existing methods cannot complete dynamic occluded regions. We present a novel generative layered video decomposition framework to address the omnimatte problem. Our method does not assume a stationary scene or require camera pose or depth information and produces clean, complete layers, including convincing completions of occluded dynamic regions. Our core idea is to train a video diffusion model to identify and remove scene effects caused by a specific object. We show that this model can be finetuned from an existing video inpainting model with a small, carefully curated dataset, and demonstrate high-quality decompositions and editing results for a wide range of casually captured videos containing soft shadows, glossy reflections, splashing water, and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Over the long term, accurately quantifying the power generation of renewable energy under the influence of climate change is essential for the development of sustainable power systems. However, due to interdisciplinary differences in data requirements, climate data often lacks the necessary hourly resolution to capture the short-term variability and uncertainties of renewable energy resources. To address this limitation, a super-resolution recurrent diffusion model (SRDM) has been developed to enhance the temporal resolution of climate data and model the short-term uncertainty. The SRDM incorporates a pre-trained decoder and a denoising network, that generates long-term, high-resolution climate data through a recurrent coupling mechanism. The high-resolution climate data is then converted into power value using the mechanism model, enabling the simulation of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation on future long-term scales. Case studies were conducted in the Ejina region of Inner Mongolia, China, using fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) data under two climate pathways: SSP126 and SSP585. The results demonstrate that the SRDM outperforms existing generative models in generating super-resolution climate data. Furthermore, the research highlights the estimation biases introduced when low-resolution climate data is used for power conversion.</p></details> |  |

Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MaRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

At inference time, however, these models are generally unable to provide predictions over long time rollouts due to accumulation of errors leading to diverging trajectories. In essence, emulators operate out of distribution, and controlling the online distribution quickly becomes intractable in large-scale settings. To address this fundamental issue, and focusing on time-stationary systems admitting an invariant measure, we leverage diffusion models to obtain an implicit estimator of the score of this invariant measure. We show that this model of the score function can be used to stabilize autoregressive emulator rollouts by applying on-the-fly denoising during inference, a process we call \textit{thermalization}. Thermalizing an emulator rollout is shown to extend the time horizon of stable predictions by an order of magnitude in complex systems exhibiting turbulent and chaotic behavior, opening up a novel application of diffusion models in the context of neural emulation.</p></details> |  |

Current methods require heavy test-time computation, altering the standard diffusion training process or denoiser architecture, or making heavy approximations. We propose a new framework that sidesteps these issues by using covariance information that is available for free from training data and the curvature of the generative trajectory, which is linked to the covariance through the second-order Tweedie's formula. We integrate these sources of information using (i) a novel method to transfer covariance estimates across noise levels and (ii) low-rank updates in a given noise level. We validate the method on linear inverse problems, where it outperforms recent baselines, especially with fewer diffusion steps.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |

Unlearning toxic motions is challenging as those can be generated from explicit text prompts and from implicit toxic combinations of safe motions (e.g., ``kicking" is ``loading and swinging a leg"). We propose the first motion unlearning benchmark by filtering toxic motions from the large and recent text-to-motion datasets of HumanML3D and Motion-X. We propose baselines, by adapting state-of-the-art image unlearning techniques to process spatio-temporal signals. Finally, we propose a novel motion unlearning model based on Latent Code Replacement, which we dub LCR.

Recently, the diffusion model, which demonstrates unprecedented generative potential, has been explored in image fusion. However, these approaches typically incorporate predefined multimodal guidance into diffusion, failing to capture the dynamically changing significance of each modality, while lacking theoretical guarantees. To address this issue, we reveal a significant spatio-temporal imbalance in image denoising; specifically, the diffusion model produces dynamic information gains in different image regions with denoising steps. Based on this observation, we Dig into the Diffusion Information Gains (Dig2DIG) and theoretically derive a diffusion-based dynamic image fusion framework that provably reduces the upper bound of the generalization error. Accordingly, we introduce diffusion information gains (DIG) to quantify the information contribution of each modality at different denoising steps, thereby providing dynamic guidance during the fusion process. Extensive experiments on multiple fusion scenarios confirm that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based approaches in terms of both fusion quality and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, they sometimes struggle to accurately depict specific entities described in prompts, a limitation known as the entity missing problem in compositional generation. While prior studies suggested that adjusting cross-attention maps during the denoising process could alleviate this problem, they did not systematically investigate which objective functions could best address it. This study examines three potential causes of the entity-missing problem, focusing on cross-attention dynamics: (1) insufficient attention intensity for certain entities, (2) overly broad attention spread, and (3) excessive overlap between attention maps of different entities. We found that reducing overlap in attention maps between entities can effectively minimize the rate of entity missing. Specifically, we hypothesize that tokens related to specific entities compete for attention on certain image regions during the denoising process, which can lead to divided attention across tokens and prevent accurate representation of each entity. To address this issue, we introduced four loss functions, Intersection over Union (IoU), center-of-mass (CoM) distance, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and clustering compactness (CC) to regulate attention overlap during denoising steps without the need for retraining. Experimental results across a wide variety of benchmarks reveal that these proposed training-free methods significantly improve compositional accuracy, outperforming previous approaches in visual question answering (VQA), captioning scores, CLIP similarity, and human evaluations. Notably, these methods improved human evaluation scores by 9% over the best baseline, demonstrating substantial improvements in compositional alignment.</p></details> | TMLR - 2025 |

Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

However, existing approaches face fundamental limitations: 3DMM-based methods maintain temporal consistency but lack fine-grained regional control, while Stable Diffusion-based methods enable spatial manipulation but suffer from temporal inconsistencies. The integration of these approaches is hindered by incompatible control mechanisms and semantic entanglement of facial representations. This paper presents DisentTalk, introducing a data-driven semantic disentanglement framework that decomposes 3DMM expression parameters into meaningful subspaces for fine-grained facial control. Building upon this disentangled representation, we develop a hierarchical latent diffusion architecture that operates in 3DMM parameter space, integrating region-aware attention mechanisms to ensure both spatial precision and temporal coherence. To address the scarcity of high-quality Chinese training data, we introduce CHDTF, a Chinese high-definition talking face dataset.

Although state-of-the-art generative video models have advanced significantly for natural videos, they remain underexplored in microscopy domains. To address this gap, we fine-tune a pretrained video diffusion model on microscopy-specific sequences, exploring three conditioning strategies: (1) text prompts derived from numeric phenotypic measurements (e.g., proliferation rates, migration speeds, cell-death frequencies), (2) direct numeric embeddings of phenotype scores, and (3) image-conditioned generation, where an initial microscopy frame is extended into a complete video sequence. Evaluation using biologically meaningful morphological, proliferation, and migration metrics demonstrates that fine-tuning substantially improves realism and accurately captures critical cellular behaviors such as mitosis and migration. Notably, the fine-tuned model also generalizes beyond the training horizon, generating coherent cell dynamics even in extended sequences. However, precisely controlling specific phenotypic characteristics remains challenging, highlighting opportunities for future work to enhance conditioning methods. Our results demonstrate the potential for domain-specific fine-tuning of generative video models to produce biologically plausible synthetic microscopy data, supporting applications such as in-silico hypothesis testing and data augmentation.</p></details> |  |

These motion cues are typically derived from video data but are susceptible to limitations including low temporal resolution, motion blur, overexposure, and inaccuracies under low-light conditions. In contrast, event cameras provide data streams with exceptionally high temporal resolution, a wide dynamic range, and inherent resistance to motion blur and exposure issues. In this work, we propose EvAnimate, a framework that leverages event streams as motion cues to animate static human images. Our approach employs a specialized event representation that transforms asynchronous event streams into 3-channel slices with controllable slicing rates and appropriate slice density, ensuring compatibility with diffusion models. Subsequently, a dual-branch architecture generates high-quality videos by harnessing the inherent motion dynamics of the event streams, thereby enhancing both video quality and temporal consistency. Specialized data augmentation strategies further enhance cross-person generalization. Finally, we establish a new benchmarking, including simulated event data for training and validation, and a real-world event dataset capturing human actions under normal and extreme scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate that EvAnimate achieves high temporal fidelity and robust performance in scenarios where traditional video-derived cues fall short.</p></details> |  |

We propose and evaluate two autoencoder architectures: a homogeneous model forcing amino acids of the same type to be identically distributed in the latent space, and an inhomogeneous model employing a noise-based variant of masking. As a baseline we take a latent space learned by masked language modelling, and evaluate discriminative capability on a range of protein property prediction tasks. Our finding is twofold: the diffusion models trained on both our proposed variants display higher discriminative power than the one trained on the masked language model baseline, none of the diffusion representations achieve the performance of the masked language model embeddings themselves.</p></details> |  |

Building upon a lengthy Markov chain, diffusion-based methods possess remarkable modeling capacity, enabling them to achieve outstanding performance in real-world scenarios. Unlike previous methods that focus on modifying the noise schedule or sampling process to enhance performance, our approach emphasizes the improved utilization of LR information. We find that different regions of the LR image can be viewed as corresponding to different timesteps in a diffusion process, where flat areas are closer to the target HR distribution but edge and texture regions are farther away. In these flat areas, applying a slight noise is more advantageous for the reconstruction. We associate this characteristic with uncertainty and propose to apply uncertainty estimate to guide region-specific noise level control, a technique we refer to as Uncertainty-guided Noise Weighting. Pixels with lower uncertainty (i.e., flat regions) receive reduced noise to preserve more LR information, therefore improving performance. Furthermore, we modify the network architecture of previous methods to develop our Uncertainty-guided Perturbation Super-Resolution (UPSR) model.

Next, we use an off-the-shelf controllable diffusion model to generate multiple images. Then, the generated data are refined using a comprehensively designed metric, Composite Layout and Image Score (CLIS), to ensure quality. Our customized synthetic high-quality samples boost performance in various scenarios, especially in addressing challenges associated with long-tailed distribution and imbalanced datasets. Experiment results on downstream tasks demonstrate that ACP can significantly improve the performance of existing models.

In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. By grounding depth-of-field adjustments, our method preserves the underlying scene structure as the level of blur is varied. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves flexible, lens-like blur control but also supports applications such as real image editing via inversion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://atfortes.github.io/projects/bokeh-diffusion/</p></details> |
| **[Hiding Images in Diffusion Models by Editing Learned Score Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18459v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18459v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hiding data using neural networks (i.e., neural steganography) has achieved remarkable success across both discriminative classifiers and generative adversarial networks. However, the potential of data hiding in diffusion models remains relatively unexplored. Current methods exhibit limitations in achieving high extraction accuracy, model fidelity, and hiding efficiency due primarily to the entanglement of the hiding and extraction processes with multiple denoising diffusion steps. To address these, we describe a simple yet effective approach that embeds images at specific timesteps in the reverse diffusion process by editing the learned score functions. Additionally, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that combines gradient-based parameter selection with low-rank adaptation to enhance model fidelity and hiding efficiency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method extracts high-quality images at human-indistinguishable levels, replicates the original model behaviors at both sample and population levels, and embeds images orders of magnitude faster than prior methods. Besides, our method naturally supports multi-recipient scenarios through independent extraction channels.</p></details> |  |

However, exploration of aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences remains limited. In comparison to supervised fine-tuning, existing methods that align diffusion model suffer from low training efficiency and subpar generation quality due to the long Markov chain process and the intractability of the reverse process. To address these limitations, we introduce DDIM-InPO, an efficient method for direct preference alignment of diffusion models. Our approach conceptualizes diffusion model as a single-step generative model, allowing us to fine-tune the outputs of specific latent variables selectively. In order to accomplish this objective, we first assign implicit rewards to any latent variable directly via a reparameterization technique. Then we construct an Inversion technique to estimate appropriate latent variables for preference optimization. This modification process enables the diffusion model to only fine-tune the outputs of latent variables that have a strong correlation with the preference dataset. Experimental results indicate that our DDIM-InPO achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 400 steps of fine-tuning, surpassing all preference aligning baselines for T2I diffusion models in human preference evaluation tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

Existing methods mostly assess the generated panoramas with InceptionNet or CLIP based metrics, which tend to perceive the image quality and is \textbf{not suitable for evaluating the distortion}. In this work, we first propose a distortion-specific CLIP, named Distort-CLIP to accurately evaluate the panorama distortion and discover the \textbf{``visual cheating''} phenomenon in previous works (\ie, tending to improve the visual results by sacrificing distortion accuracy). This phenomenon arises because prior methods employ a single network to learn the distinct panorama distortion and content completion at once, which leads the model to prioritize optimizing the latter. To address the phenomenon, we propose \textbf{PanoDecouple}, a decoupled diffusion model framework, which decouples the panorama generation into distortion guidance and content completion, aiming to generate panoramas with both accurate distortion and visual appeal. Specifically, we design a DistortNet for distortion guidance by imposing panorama-specific distortion prior and a modified condition registration mechanism; and a ContentNet for content completion by imposing perspective image information. Additionally, a distortion correction loss function with Distort-CLIP is introduced to constrain the distortion explicitly. The extensive experiments validate that PanoDecouple surpasses existing methods both in distortion and visual metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025.

Unlike prior methods that focus solely on preserving facial identity, our approach captures detailed full-body appearance, aligning with text descriptions for body structure and scene variations. Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K, a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs. Extensive ablation studies validate design choices, and we demonstrate the versatility of Visual Persona across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project page is available at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/Visual-Persona</p></details> |

However, this approach is fundamentally flawed: the uniform operation of the forward process across all pixels compromises normal pixels while attempting to combat adversarial perturbations, resulting in the target model producing incorrect predictions. Simply relying on low-intensity noise is insufficient for effective defense. To address this critical issue, we implement a heterogeneous purification strategy grounded in the interpretability of neural networks. Our method decisively applies higher-intensity noise to specific pixels that the target model focuses on while the remaining pixels are subjected to only low-intensity noise. This requirement motivates us to redesign the sampling process of the diffusion model, allowing for the effective removal of varying noise levels. Furthermore, to evaluate our method against strong adaptative attack, our proposed method sharply reduces time cost and memory usage through a single-step resampling. The empirical evidence from extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms most current adversarial training and purification techniques by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDDM: Pseudo Depth Diffusion Model for RGB-PD Semantic Segmentation Based in Complex Indoor Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18393v1)** | 2025-03-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.18393v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of RGB and depth modalities significantly enhances the accuracy of segmenting complex indoor scenes, with depth data from RGB-D cameras playing a crucial role in this improvement. However, collecting an RGB-D dataset is more expensive than an RGB dataset due to the need for specialized depth sensors. Aligning depth and RGB images also poses challenges due to sensor positioning and issues like missing data and noise. In contrast, Pseudo Depth (PD) from high-precision depth estimation algorithms can eliminate the dependence on RGB-D sensors and alignment processes, as well as provide effective depth information and show significant potential in semantic segmentation. Therefore, to explore the practicality of utilizing pseudo depth instead of real depth for semantic segmentation, we design an RGB-PD segmentation pipeline to integrate RGB and pseudo depth and propose a Pseudo Depth Aggregation Module (PDAM) for fully exploiting the informative clues provided by the diverse pseudo depth maps. The PDAM aggregates multiple pseudo depth maps into a single modality, making it easily adaptable to other RGB-D segmentation methods. In addition, the pre-trained diffusion model serves as a strong feature extractor for RGB segmentation tasks, but multi-modal diffusion-based segmentation methods remain unexplored. Therefore, we present a Pseudo Depth Diffusion Model (PDDM) that adopts a large-scale text-image diffusion model as a feature extractor and a simple yet effective fusion strategy to integrate pseudo depth. To verify the applicability of pseudo depth and our PDDM, we perform extensive experiments on the NYUv2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that pseudo depth can effectively enhance segmentation performance, and our PDDM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other methods by +6.98 mIoU on NYUv2 and +2.11 mIoU on SUNRGB-D.</p></details> |  |

However, current text-to-video generation models still face significant challenges such as high training costs, substantial data requirements, and difficulties in maintaining consistency between given text and motion of the foreground object. To address these challenges, we propose mask-guided video generation, which can control video generation through mask motion sequences, while requiring limited training data. Our model enhances existing architectures by incorporating foreground masks for precise text-position matching and motion trajectory control. Through mask motion sequences, we guide the video generation process to maintain consistent foreground objects throughout the sequence. Additionally, through a first-frame sharing strategy and autoregressive extension approach, we achieve more stable and longer video generation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that this approach excels in various video generation tasks, such as video editing and generating artistic videos, outperforming previous methods in terms of consistency and quality.

However, existing methods predominantly focus on synthesizing remote sensing (RS) images aligned with real images in a global layout view, which limits their applicability in RS image object detection (RSIOD) research. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-class and multi-scale object image generator based on DGMs, termed MMO-IG, designed to generate RS images with supervised object labels from global and local aspects simultaneously. Specifically, from the local view, MMO-IG encodes various RS instances using an iso-spacing instance map (ISIM). During the generation process, it decodes each instance region with iso-spacing value in ISIM-corresponding to both background and foreground instances-to produce RS images through the denoising process of diffusion models. Considering the complex interdependencies among MMOs, we construct a spatial-cross dependency knowledge graph (SCDKG). This ensures a realistic and reliable multidirectional distribution among MMOs for region embedding, thereby reducing the discrepancy between source and target domains. Besides, we propose a structured object distribution instruction (SODI) to guide the generation of synthesized RS image content from a global aspect with SCDKG-based ISIM together. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MMO-IG exhibits superior generation capabilities for RS images with dense MMO-supervised labels, and RS detectors pre-trained with MMO-IG show excellent performance on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are task-specific and fall short of embedding-based retrieval in performance. This paper proposes GENIUS, a universal generative retrieval framework supporting diverse tasks across multiple modalities and domains. At its core, GENIUS introduces modality-decoupled semantic quantization, transforming multimodal data into discrete IDs encoding both modality and semantics. Moreover, to enhance generalization, we propose a query augmentation that interpolates between a query and its target, allowing GENIUS to adapt to varied query forms. Evaluated on the M-BEIR benchmark, it surpasses prior generative methods by a clear margin. Unlike embedding-based retrieval, GENIUS consistently maintains high retrieval speed across database size, with competitive performance across multiple benchmarks. With additional re-ranking, GENIUS often achieves results close to those of embedding-based methods while preserving efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Most current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence. To mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans. To achieve it, we first formulate Region-Centric tasks and construct a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. Our project page is https://medrega.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in video modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static modalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a comprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in video understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e., hallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in 6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on hallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model reasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition, inspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking model to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT enhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the thinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on hallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%.

This paper investigates the challenge of efficient multitask multimodal data communication in UAV-assisted ISAC systems, in the considered system model, hyperspectral (HSI) and LiDAR data are collected by UAV-mounted sensors for both target classification and data reconstruction at the terrestrial BS. The limited channel capacity and complex environmental conditions pose significant challenges to effective air-to-ground communication. To tackle this issue, we propose a perception-enhanced multitask multimodal semantic communication (PE-MMSC) system that strategically leverages the onboard computational and sensing capabilities of UAVs. In particular, we first propose a robust multimodal feature fusion method that adaptively combines HSI and LiDAR semantics while considering channel noise and task requirements. Then the method introduces a perception-enhanced (PE) module incorporating attention mechanisms to perform coarse classification on UAV side, thereby optimizing the attention-based multimodal fusion and transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PE-MMSC system achieves 5\%--10\% higher target classification accuracy compared to conventional systems without PE module, while maintaining comparable data reconstruction quality with acceptable computational overheads.</p></details> |  |

Existing video-based Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) handle basic conversations but struggle with precise pixel-level grounding in videos. To address this, we introduce VideoGLaMM, a LMM designed for fine-grained pixel-level grounding in videos based on user-provided textual inputs. Our design seamlessly connects three key components: a Large Language Model, a dual vision encoder that emphasizes both spatial and temporal details, and a spatio-temporal decoder for accurate mask generation. This connection is facilitated via tunable V-L and L-V adapters that enable close Vision-Language (VL) alignment. The architecture is trained to synchronize both spatial and temporal elements of video content with textual instructions. To enable fine-grained grounding, we curate a multimodal dataset featuring detailed visually-grounded conversations using a semiautomatic annotation pipeline, resulting in a diverse set of 38k video-QA triplets along with 83k objects and 671k masks. We evaluate VideoGLaMM on three challenging tasks: Grounded Conversation Generation, Visual Grounding, and Referring Video Segmentation.

Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or image-caption data, disregarding pathology reports with more clinically authentic information from pathologists and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Even recent slide-level FMs still struggle to provide whole-slide context for patch representation. In this study, for the first time, we develop a pathology foundation model incorporating three levels of modalities: pathology slides, pathology reports, and gene expression data, which resulted in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types, amounting to over 116 million pathological patch images. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm that injects the multimodal whole-slide context into the patch representation, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the pretraining workflow for CPath, enabling the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate three modalities at the whole-slide context for enhancing pathology FMs. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, we built the largest spectrum of oncological benchmark, spanning 7 categories of oncological applications in 15 types of 97 practical oncological tasks.</p></details> | 62 pages |

This introduces new challenges for CD methods, as existing weight-sharing Siamese networks struggle to effectively learn the cross-modal data distribution between optical and SAR images. To address this challenge, we propose a unified MultiModal CD framework, M$^2$CD. We integrate Mixture of Experts (MoE) modules into the backbone to explicitly handle diverse modalities, thereby enhancing the model's ability to learn multimodal data distributions.

We design multiple variants of M$^2$CD based on both CNN and Transformer backbones.

To address this challenge, we propose CalibQuant, a simple yet highly effective visual quantization strategy that drastically reduces both memory and computational overhead. Specifically, CalibQuant introduces an extreme 1-bit quantization scheme, complemented by novel post-scaling and calibration techniques tailored to the intrinsic patterns of KV caches, thereby ensuring high efficiency without compromising model performance.

However, achieving accurate text-image alignment for LMMs, particularly in compositional scenarios, remains challenging. Existing approaches, such as layout planning for multi-step generation and learning from human feedback or AI feedback, depend heavily on prompt engineering, costly human annotations, and continual upgrading, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic iterative self-improvement framework (SILMM) that can enable LMMs to provide helpful and scalable self-feedback and optimize text-image alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO can readily applied to LMMs that use discrete visual tokens as intermediate image representations; while it is less suitable for LMMs with continuous visual features, as obtaining generation probabilities is challenging. To adapt SILMM to LMMs with continuous features, we propose a diversity mechanism to obtain diverse representations and a kernel-based continuous DPO for alignment.

In this work, we rethink the relationship between text-to-image generation and retrieval, proposing a unified framework for both tasks with one single Large Multimodal Model (LMM). Specifically, we first explore the intrinsic discriminative abilities of LMMs and introduce an efficient generative retrieval method for text-to-image retrieval in a training-free manner. Subsequently, we unify generation and retrieval autoregressively and propose an autonomous decision mechanism to choose the best-matched one between generated and retrieved images as the response to the text prompt. To standardize the evaluation of unified text-to-image generation and retrieval, we construct TIGeR-Bench, a benchmark spanning both creative and knowledge-intensive domains. Extensive experiments on TIGeR-Bench and two retrieval benchmarks, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera-ready</p></details> |

This study introduces PSO-UNet, which integrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with the U-Net architecture for dynamic hyperparameter optimization. Unlike traditional manual tuning or alternative optimization approaches, PSO effectively navigates complex hyperparameter search spaces, explicitly optimizing the number of filters, kernel size, and learning rate. PSO-UNet substantially enhances segmentation performance, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 0.9578 and 0.9523 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.9194 and 0.9097 on the BraTS 2021 and Figshare datasets, respectively. Moreover, the method reduces computational complexity significantly, utilizing only 7.8 million parameters and executing in approximately 906 seconds, markedly faster than comparable U-Net-based frameworks. These outcomes underscore PSO-UNet's robust generalization capabilities across diverse MRI modalities and tumor classifications, emphasizing its clinical potential and clear advantages over conventional hyperparameter tuning methods. Future research will explore hybrid optimization strategies and validate the framework against other bio-inspired algorithms to enhance its robustness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, Gecco 2025 Conference</p></details> |

We present MIRAGE, a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that exploits narrative-driven context and role immersion to circumvent safety mechanisms in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). By systematically decomposing the toxic query into environment, role, and action triplets, MIRAGE constructs a multi-turn visual storytelling sequence of images and text using Stable Diffusion, guiding the target model through an engaging detective narrative. This process progressively lowers the model's defences and subtly guides its reasoning through structured contextual cues, ultimately eliciting harmful responses. In extensive experiments on the selected datasets with six mainstream MLLMs, MIRAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving attack success rates by up to 17.5% over the best baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that role immersion and structured semantic reconstruction can activate inherent model biases, facilitating the model's spontaneous violation of ethical safeguards. These results highlight critical weaknesses in current multimodal safety mechanisms and underscore the urgent need for more robust defences against cross-modal threats.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we continually pre-train prevailing VFMs in a multimodal manner such that they can effortlessly process visual inputs of varying sizes and produce visual representations that are more aligned with language representations, regardless of their original pre-training process. To this end, we introduce CoMP, a carefully designed multimodal pre-training pipeline. CoMP uses a Continual Rotary Position Embedding to support native resolution continual pre-training, and an Alignment Loss between visual and textual features through language prototypes to align multimodal representations. By three-stage training, our VFMs achieve remarkable improvements not only in multimodal understanding but also in other downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation. Remarkably, CoMP-SigLIP achieves scores of 66.7 on ChartQA and 75.9 on DocVQA with a 0.5B LLM, while maintaining an 87.4% accuracy on ImageNet-1K and a 49.5 mIoU on ADE20K under frozen chunk evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available in https://github.com/SliMM-X/CoMP-MM</p></details> |

However, evaluating multimodality is challenging since the task is ill-posed. Therefore, we first propose an alternative paradigm to make the task well-posed. Next, while state-of-the-art methods predict multimodality, this requires oversampling a large volume of predictions. This raises key questions: (1) Can we capture multimodality by efficiently sampling a smaller number of predictions? (2) Subsequently, which of the predicted futures is more likely for an observed pose sequence? We address these questions with MotionMap, a simple yet effective heatmap based representation for multimodality. We extend heatmaps to represent a spatial distribution over the space of all possible motions, where different local maxima correspond to different forecasts for a given observation. MotionMap can capture a variable number of modes per observation and provide confidence measures for different modes. Further, MotionMap allows us to introduce the notion of uncertainty and controllability over the forecasted pose sequence. Finally, MotionMap captures rare modes that are non-trivial to evaluate yet critical for safety. We support our claims through multiple qualitative and quantitative experiments using popular 3D human pose datasets: Human3.6M and AMASS, highlighting the strengths and limitations of our proposed method.

However, the field lacks a standardized dataset to promote comparisons between models. To address this gap, we present CarbonSense, the first machine learning-ready dataset for DDCFM. CarbonSense integrates measured carbon fluxes, meteorological predictors, and satellite imagery from 385 locations across the globe, offering comprehensive coverage and facilitating robust model training. Additionally, we provide a baseline model using a current state-of-the-art DDCFM approach and a novel transformer based model. Our experiments illustrate the potential gains that multimodal deep learning techniques can bring to this domain.

Inspired by this cognitive phenomenon, we observe that the early training stage is also important for the multimodal learning process, where dataset information is rapidly acquired. We refer to this stage as the prime learning window. However, based on our observation, this prime learning window in multimodal learning is often dominated by information-sufficient modalities, which in turn suppresses the information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. To address this issue, we propose Information Acquisition Regulation (InfoReg), a method designed to balance information acquisition among modalities. Specifically, InfoReg slows down the information acquisition process of information-sufficient modalities during the prime learning window, which could promote information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. This regulation enables a more balanced learning process and improves the overall performance of the multimodal network. Experiments show that InfoReg outperforms related multimodal imbalanced methods across various datasets, achieving superior model performance.

However, current agents primarily demonstrate strong understanding capabilities in static environments and are mainly applied to relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces. We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks. Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions. To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-World, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-oriented questions in three formats. We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Image LLMs and Video LLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content. Our findings reveal that current models struggle with dynamic GUI content without manually annotated keyframes or operation history. On the other hand, Video LLMs fall short in all GUI-oriented tasks given the sparse GUI video dataset. Therefore, we take the initial step of leveraging a fine-tuned Video LLM, GUI-Vid, as a GUI-oriented assistant, demonstrating an improved understanding of various GUI tasks. However, due to the limitations in the performance of base LLMs, we conclude that using video LLMs as GUI agents remains a significant challenge. We believe our work provides valuable insights for future research in dynamic GUI content understanding.

In this paper, we study this problem from the perspective of visual-spatial reasoning, and propose a new learning task for MLLMs, termed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT). Different from recent visual CoT studies, which focus more on visual knowledge reasoning, GCoT is keen to helping MLLMs to recognize and ground the relevant visual cues step by step, thereby predicting the correct answer with grounding coordinates as the intuitive basis. To facilitate this task, we also carefully design and construct a dataset called multimodal grounded chain-of-thought (MM-GCoT) consisting of 24,022 GCoT examples for 5,033 images. Besides, a comprehensive consistency evaluation system is also introduced, including the metrics of answer accuracy, grounding accuracy and answer-grounding consistency. We further design and conduct a bunch of experiments on 12 advanced MLLMs, and reveal some notable findings: i. most MLLMs performs poorly on the consistency evaluation, indicating obvious visual hallucination; ii. visual hallucination is not directly related to the parameter size and general multimodal performance, i.e., a larger and stronger MLLM is not less affected by this issue. Lastly, we also demonstrate that the proposed dataset can help existing MLLMs to well cultivate their GCoT capability and reduce the inconsistent answering significantly. Moreover, their GCoT can be also generalized to exiting multimodal tasks, such as open-world QA and REC.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, as training data, it provides richer contextual reasoning information, thereby guiding the model to achieve better performance. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) primarily rely on single-turn dialogue training and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, following the characteristics of human dialogue, such as focused topics and concise, clear content, we present MMCR (Multimodal Multi-turn Contextual Reasoning), a novel dataset comprising: (1) MMCR-310k -- the largest multi-image multi-turn instruction tuning dataset with 310K contextual dialogues, each covering 1-4 images and 4 or 8 dialogue turns; and (2) MMCR-Bench -- a diagnostic benchmark featuring dialogues, spanning 8 domains (Humanities, Natural, Science, Education, etc.) and 40 sub-topics. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that models fine-tuned with MMCR-310k achieve 5.2\% higher contextual accuracy on MMCR-Bench, while showing consistent improvements on existing benchmarks (+1.1\% on AI2D, +1.2\% on MMMU and MMVet).

Despite recent advances in multimodal survival models, collecting complete modalities for multimodal fusion still poses a significant challenge, hindering their application in clinical settings. Current approaches tackling incomplete modalities often fall short, as they typically compensate for only a limited part of the knowledge of missing modalities. To address this issue, we propose a Distilled Prompt Learning framework (DisPro) to utilize the strong robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to missing modalities, which employs two-stage prompting for compensation of comprehensive information for missing modalities. In the first stage, Unimodal Prompting (UniPro) distills the knowledge distribution of each modality, preparing for supplementing modality-specific knowledge of the missing modality in the subsequent stage. In the second stage, Multimodal Prompting (MultiPro) leverages available modalities as prompts for LLMs to infer the missing modality, which provides modality-common information. Simultaneously, the unimodal knowledge acquired in the first stage is injected into multimodal inference to compensate for the modality-specific knowledge of the missing modality. Extensive experiments covering various missing scenarios demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.

This redundancy greatly limits the efficient deployment of continually adaptable multimodal large language models, hindering their ability to refine existing skills and acquire new competencies over time. We reframe the problem of lifelong Instruction Tuning (LiIT) via data selection, where the model automatically selects beneficial samples to learn from earlier and new datasets based on the current state of acquired knowledge in the model. We propose Adapt-$\infty$, a new multi-way and adaptive data selection approach that dynamically balances sample efficiency and effectiveness during LiIT. We first construct pseudo-skill clusters by grouping gradient-based sample vectors. Next, we select the best-performing data selector for each skill cluster from a pool of selector experts, including our newly proposed scoring function, Image Grounding score. This data selector samples a subset of the most important samples from each skill cluster for training. To prevent the continuous increase in the size of the dataset pool during LiIT, we introduce a cluster-wise permanent data pruning strategy to remove the most semantically redundant samples from each cluster, keeping computational requirements manageable. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of Adapt-$\infty$ over a sequence of multimodal instruction tuning datasets with various tasks, including (Knowledge) VQA, multilingual, grounding, reasoning, language-only, and multi-image comprehension. Training with samples selected by Adapt-$\infty$ alleviates catastrophic forgetting, especially for rare tasks, and promotes forward transfer across the continuum using only a fraction of the original data.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

To address this challenge, our study has developed a robust model that effectively integrates multimodal sentiment information, even in the absence of text modality. Specifically, we have developed a Double-Flow Self-Distillation Framework, including Unified Modality Cross-Attention (UMCA) and Modality Imagination Autoencoder (MIA), which excels at processing both scenarios with complete modalities and those with missing text modality. In detail, when the text modality is missing, our framework uses the LLM-based model to simulate the text representation from the audio modality, while the MIA module supplements information from the other two modalities to make the simulated text representation similar to the real text representation. To further align the simulated and real representations, and to enable the model to capture the continuous nature of sample orders in sentiment valence regression tasks, we have also introduced the Rank-N Contrast (RNC) loss function. When testing on the CMU-MOSEI, our model achieved outstanding performance on MAE and significantly outperformed other models when text modality is missing.

To efficiently address GPR signal noise, we introduce an advanced feature representation called the subsurface feature matrix (SFM). The SFM leverages frequency domain data and identifies peaks within radar scans. Additionally, we propose a novel feature matching method that estimates GPR displacement by aligning SFMs. The integrations from these three input sources are consolidated using a factor graph approach to achieve multimodal robot odometry. Our method has been developed and evaluated with the CMU-GPR public dataset, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and robustness with real-time performance in robotic odometry tasks.</p></details> |  |

In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021). We discuss how our interdisciplinary system could revolutionize PTSD therapy and cognitive neuroscience by enabling 24/7 monitoring, context-aware intervention, and rich data collection outside traditional labs. The vision is a future where AI-enhanced devices continuously collaborate with the human brain, offering therapeutic support and deep insights into neural function, with the resulting real-world context rich neural data, in turn, accelerating the development of more biologically-grounded and human-centric AI.</p></details> |  |

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive 2D image reasoning segmentation, adapting these capabilities to 3D scenes remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-For3D, a simple yet effective framework that transfers knowledge from 2D MLLMs to 3D scene understanding. Specifically, we utilize MLLMs to generate multi-view pseudo segmentation masks and corresponding text embeddings, then unproject 2D masks into 3D space and align them with the text embeddings. The primary challenge lies in the absence of 3D context and spatial consistency across multiple views, causing the model to hallucinate objects that do not exist and fail to target objects consistently. Training the 3D model with such irrelevant objects leads to performance degradation. To address this, we introduce a spatial consistency strategy to enforce that segmentation masks remain coherent in the 3D space, effectively capturing the geometry of the scene. Moreover, we develop a Token-for-Query approach for multimodal semantic alignment, enabling consistent identification of the same object across different views. Extensive evaluations on various challenging indoor scene benchmarks demonstrate that, even without any labeled 3D training data, MLLM-For3D outperforms existing 3D reasoning segmentation methods, effectively interpreting user intent, understanding 3D scenes, and reasoning about spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, we introduce MathAgent, a novel Mixture-of-Math-Agent framework designed specifically to address these challenges. Our approach decomposes error detection into three phases, each handled by a specialized agent: an image-text consistency validator, a visual semantic interpreter, and an integrative error analyzer. This architecture enables more accurate processing of mathematical content by explicitly modeling relationships between multimodal problems and student solution steps. We evaluate MathAgent on real-world educational data, demonstrating approximately 5% higher accuracy in error step identification and 3% improvement in error categorization compared to baseline models. Besides, MathAgent has been successfully deployed in an educational platform that has served over one million K-12 students, achieving nearly 90% student satisfaction while generating significant cost savings by reducing manual error detection.</p></details> | Work In Progress |

However, current algorithms typically tackle individual sub-tasks separately, which leads to low efficiency when aiming at obtaining full-perception results. Some multi-task learning methods try to unify multiple tasks with one model, but do not solve the conflicts in multi-task learning. In this paper, we introduce M3Net, a novel multimodal and multi-task network that simultaneously tackles detection, segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous driving and achieves superior performance than single task model. M3Net takes multimodal data as input and multiple tasks via query-token interactions. To enhance the integration of multi-modal features for multi-task learning, we first propose the Modality-Adaptive Feature Integration (MAFI) module, which enables single-modality features to predict channel-wise attention weights for their high-performing tasks, respectively. Based on integrated features, we then develop task-specific query initialization strategies to accommodate the needs of detection/segmentation and 3D occupancy prediction. Leveraging the properly initialized queries, a shared decoder transforms queries and BEV features layer-wise, facilitating multi-task learning. Furthermore, we propose a Task-oriented Channel Scaling (TCS) module in the decoder to mitigate conflicts between optimizing for different tasks. Additionally, our proposed multi-task querying and TCS module support both Transformer-based decoder and Mamba-based decoder, demonstrating its flexibility to different architectures. M3Net achieves state-of-the-art multi-task learning performance on the nuScenes benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, multimodal motion prediction for traffic agents has been clouded by the lack of multimodal ground truth. Existing works predominantly adopt the winner-take-all training strategy to tackle this challenge, yet still suffer from limited trajectory diversity and uncalibrated mode confidence. While some approaches address these limitations by generating excessive trajectory candidates, they necessitate a post-processing stage to identify the most representative modes, a process lacking universal principles and compromising trajectory accuracy. We are thus motivated to introduce ModeSeq, a new multimodal prediction paradigm that models modes as sequences. Unlike the common practice of decoding multiple plausible trajectories in one shot, ModeSeq requires motion decoders to infer the next mode step by step, thereby more explicitly capturing the correlation between modes and significantly enhancing the ability to reason about multimodality. Leveraging the inductive bias of sequential mode prediction, we also propose the Early-Match-Take-All (EMTA) training strategy to diversify the trajectories further. Without relying on dense mode prediction or heuristic post-processing, ModeSeq considerably improves the diversity of multimodal output while attaining satisfactory trajectory accuracy, resulting in balanced performance on motion prediction benchmarks. Moreover, ModeSeq naturally emerges with the capability of mode extrapolation, which supports forecasting more behavior modes when the future is highly uncertain.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

However, recent findings suggest high semantic similarity between well-trained unimodal encoders, which raises a key question: Is there a plausible way to connect unimodal backbones for vision-language tasks? To this end, we propose a novel framework that aligns vision and language using frozen unimodal encoders. It involves selecting semantically similar encoders in the latent space, curating a concept-rich dataset of image-caption pairs, and training simple MLP projectors. We evaluated our approach on 12 zero-shot classification datasets and 2 image-text retrieval datasets. Our best model, utilizing DINOv2 and All-Roberta-Large text encoder, achieves 76\(\%\) accuracy on ImageNet with a 20-fold reduction in data and 65-fold reduction in compute requirements compared multi-modal alignment where models are trained from scratch. The proposed framework enhances the accessibility of multimodal model development while enabling flexible adaptation across diverse scenarios.

To address them, much efforts have been spent on developing novel searching operators, niching strategies and multi-objective problem transformation pipelines. Though promising, existing approaches more or less overlook the potential usage of landscape knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework tailored for MMOPs, termed as APDMMO, which facilitates peak detection via fully leveraging the landscape knowledge and hence capable of providing strong optimization performance on MMOPs. Specifically, we first design a novel surrogate landscape model which ensembles a group of non-linear activation units to improve the regression accuracy on diverse MMOPs. Then we propose a free-of-trial peak detection method which efficiently locates potential peak areas through back-propagation on the learned surrogate landscape model. Based on the detected peak areas, we employ SEP-CMAES for local search within these areas in parallel to further improve the accuracy of the found optima. Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that APDMMO outperforms several up-to-date baselines. Further ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed novel designs.

However, most evaluations rely on traditional methods like multiple-choice questions in benchmarks such as VideoMME and LongVideoBench, which are prone to lack the depth needed to capture the complex demands of real-world users. To address this limitation-and due to the prohibitive cost and slow pace of human annotation for video tasks-we introduce VideoAutoArena, an arena-style benchmark inspired by LMSYS Chatbot Arena's framework, designed to automatically assess LMMs' video analysis abilities. VideoAutoArena utilizes user simulation to generate open-ended, adaptive questions that rigorously assess model performance in video understanding. The benchmark features an automated, scalable evaluation framework, incorporating a modified ELO Rating System for fair and continuous comparisons across multiple LMMs. To validate our automated judging system, we construct a 'gold standard' using a carefully curated subset of human annotations, demonstrating that our arena strongly aligns with human judgment while maintaining scalability. Additionally, we introduce a fault-driven evolution strategy, progressively increasing question complexity to push models toward handling more challenging video analysis scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoAutoArena effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LMMs, providing insights into model strengths and areas for improvement. To further streamline our evaluation, we introduce VideoAutoBench as an auxiliary benchmark, where human annotators label winners in a subset of VideoAutoArena battles. We use GPT-4o as a judge to compare responses against these human-validated answers. Together, VideoAutoArena and VideoAutoBench offer a cost-effective, and scalable framework for evaluating LMMs in user-centric video analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://videoautoarena.github.io/</p></details> |

Here, we introduce a soft haptic ring and a data-driven rendering methodology to generate multimodal texture sensations. The device integrates pneumatic and hydraulic actuation to simulate roughness, thermal, and softness cues on the proximal phalanx, enabling users to explore surroundings naturally with their fingertips. The rendering methodology dynamically modulates those cues based on the user's exploratory actions. We validated our approach by conducting a user study with fifteen participants, who matched six virtual textures generated by the ring to their real counterparts and rated their perceived sensations. Participants achieved up to ninety percent accuracy in texture matching. The adjective ratings confirmed that the ring delivers distinct, perceptually rich stimuli across all rendered sensations.

However, existing methods typically fine-tune the parameters of LMMs to learn additional segmentation tokens and overfit grounding and segmentation datasets. Such a design would inevitably cause a catastrophic diminution in the indispensable conversational capability of general AI assistants. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art grounding LMMs across a suite of multimodal question-answering benchmarks, observing drastic performance drops that indicate vanishing general knowledge comprehension and weakened instruction following ability. To address this issue, we present F-LMM -- grounding frozen off-the-shelf LMMs in human-AI conversations -- a straightforward yet effective design based on the fact that word-pixel correspondences conducive to visual grounding inherently exist in the attention mechanism of well-trained LMMs. Using only a few trainable CNN layers, we can translate word-pixel attention weights to mask logits, which a SAM-based mask refiner can further optimise. Our F-LMM neither learns special segmentation tokens nor utilises high-quality grounded instruction-tuning data, but achieves competitive performance on referring expression segmentation and panoptic narrative grounding benchmarks while completely preserving LMMs' original conversational ability. Additionally, with instruction-following ability preserved and grounding ability obtained, F-LMM can be directly applied to complex tasks like reasoning segmentation, grounded conversation generation and visual chain-of-thought reasoning.

In this paper, we propose using the paradigm of preference optimization to solve the modality bias problem, including RLAIFVBias, a debiased preference optimization dataset, and a Noise Aware Preference Optimization algorithm. Specifically, we first construct the dataset by introducing perturbations to reduce the informational content of certain modalities, compelling the model to rely on a specific modality when generating negative responses. To address the inevitable noise in automatically constructed data, we combine the noise robust Mean Absolute Error with the Binary Cross Entropy in Direct Preference Optimization by a negative Box Cox transformation, and dynamically adjust the algorithm noise robustness based on the evaluated noise levels in the data. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating not only its effectiveness in mitigating modality bias but also its significant role in minimizing hallucinations.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation.

How can we ensure that MLLMs are safely aligned to prevent undesired behaviors such as discrimination, misinformation, or violations of ethical standards? In a further step, we need to explore how to fine-tune MLLMs to enhance reasoning performance while ensuring they satisfy safety constraints. Fundamentally, this can be formulated as a min-max optimization problem. In this study, we propose Safe RLHF-V, the first multimodal safety alignment framework that jointly optimizes helpfulness and safety using separate multimodal reward and cost models within a Lagrangian-based constrained optimization framework. Given that there is a lack of preference datasets that separate helpfulness and safety in multimodal scenarios, we introduce BeaverTails-V, the first open-source dataset with dual preference annotations for helpfulness and safety, along with multi-level safety labels (minor, moderate, severe). Additionally, we design a Multi-level Guardrail System to proactively defend against unsafe queries and adversarial attacks. By applying the Beaver-Guard-V moderation for 5 rounds of filtering and re-generation on the precursor model, the overall safety of the upstream model is significantly improved by an average of 40.9%. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning different MLLMs with Safe RLHF can effectively enhance model helpfulness while ensuring improved safety. Specifically, Safe RLHF-V improves model safety by 34.2% and helpfulness by 34.3%.

However, currently there is no straightforward and efficient framework to transfer the multimodal comprehension abilities of MLLMs to T2I models to enable them to understand multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose the X2I framework, which endows Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models with the capability to comprehend various modalities, including multilingual text, screenshot documents, images, videos, and audio. X2I is trained using merely 100K English corpus with 160 GPU hours. Building on the DiT teacher model, we adopt an innovative distillation method to extract the inference capabilities of the teacher model and design a lightweight AlignNet structure to serve as an intermediate bridge. Compared to the teacher model, X2I shows a decrease in performance degradation of less than 1\% while gaining various multimodal understanding abilities, including multilingual to image, image to image, image-text to image, video to image, audio to image, and utilizing creative fusion to enhance imagery. Furthermore, it is applicable for LoRA training in the context of image-text to image generation, filling a void in the industry in this area.

Our study employs a multimodal methodological approach, analyzing both the visual and textual elements of memes. Specifically, we perform a multimodal CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model for grouping similar memes based on text and visual content embeddings, enabling robust similarity assessments across modalities. Using the Reddit Meme Dataset and Memotion Dataset, we extract low-level visual features and high-level semantic features to identify similar meme pairs. To validate these automated similarity assessments, we conducted a user study with 50 participants, asking them to provide yes/no responses regarding meme similarity and their emotional reactions. The comparison of experimental results with human judgments showed a 67.23\% agreement, suggesting that the computational approach aligns well with human perception. Additionally, we implemented a text-based classifier using the DistilBERT model to categorize memes into one of six basic emotions. The results indicate that anger and joy are the dominant emotions in memes, with motivational memes eliciting stronger emotional responses. This research contributes to the study of multimodal memes, enhancing both language-based and visual approaches to analyzing and improving online visual communication and user experiences.

However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

However, existing methods that rely solely on static code analysis or transactional data, offer limited insight into evolving trustworthiness. We propose a multimodal data fusion framework that integrates static code features with transactional data to enhance reputability prediction. Our framework initially focuses on static code analysis, utilizing GAN-augmented opcode embeddings to address class imbalance, achieving 97.67% accuracy and a recall of 0.942 in detecting illicit contracts, surpassing traditional oversampling methods. This forms the crux of a reputability-centric fusion strategy, where combining static and transactional data improves recall by 7.25% over single-source models, demonstrating robust performance across validation sets. By providing a holistic view of smart contract behaviour, our approach enhances the model's ability to assess reputability, identify fraudulent activities, and predict anomalous patterns. These capabilities contribute to more accurate reputability assessments, proactive risk mitigation, and enhanced blockchain security.</p></details> |  |

However, research on detecting and analysing joint attention remains limited, particularly for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This study evaluates MLLMs' ability to comprehend joint attention by analysing 26 parent-child interaction videos annotated by two speech-language pathologists. These annotations identify strong and poor joint attention segments, serving as benchmarks for evaluating the models' interpretive capabilities. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret joint attention due to a lack of nuanced understanding of child-initiated eye contact, a crucial component of joint attention dynamics. This study highlights the importance of incorporating detailed eye contact to enhance MLLMs' multimodal reasoning. Addressing these gaps is essential for future research to advance the use of MLLMs in analysing and supporting parent-child interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM 2025 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Late Breaking Work (CHI'25 LBW)</p></details> |

While progress has been made in addressing traditional scientific problems, MSPs still face two primary issues: the challenge of multi-modal comprehensive reasoning in scientific problem-solving and the lack of reflective and rethinking capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-Agent framework based on the Big Seven Personality and Socratic guidance (MAPS). This framework employs seven distinct agents that leverage feedback mechanisms and the Socratic method to guide the resolution of MSPs. To tackle the first issue, we propose a progressive four-agent solving strategy, where each agent focuses on a specific stage of the problem-solving process. For the second issue, we introduce a Critic agent, inspired by Socratic questioning, which prompts critical thinking and stimulates autonomous learning. We conduct extensive experiments on the EMMA, Olympiad, and MathVista datasets, achieving promising results that outperform the current SOTA model by 15.84% across all tasks. Meanwhile, the additional analytical experiments also verify the model's progress as well as generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 14 pages |

As an important branch, industrial image anomaly detection focuses on automatically identifying visual anomalies in industrial scenarios (such as product surface defects, assembly errors, and equipment appearance anomalies) through computer vision techniques. With the rapid development of Unsupervised industrial Image Anomaly Detection (UIAD), excellent detection performance has been achieved not only in RGB setting but also in 3D and multimodal (RGB and 3D) settings. However, existing surveys primarily focus on UIAD tasks in RGB setting, with little discussion in 3D and multimodal settings. To address this gap, this artical provides a comprehensive review of UIAD tasks in the three modal settings. Specifically, we first introduce the task concept and process of UIAD. We then overview the research on UIAD in three modal settings (RGB, 3D, and multimodal), including datasets and methods, and review multimodal feature fusion strategies in multimodal setting. Finally, we summarize the main challenges faced by UIAD tasks in the three modal settings, and offer insights into future development directions, aiming to provide researchers with a comprehensive reference and offer new perspectives for the advancement of industrial informatization.

Although Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently acquire specialized knowledge in MLLMs, it introduces substantial harmful redundancy during visual instruction tuning, which exacerbates the forgetting of general knowledge and degrades downstream task performance. To address this issue, we propose LoRASculpt to eliminate harmful redundant parameters, thereby harmonizing general and specialized knowledge. Specifically, under theoretical guarantees, we introduce sparse updates into LoRA to discard redundant parameters effectively. Furthermore, we propose a Conflict Mitigation Regularizer to refine the update trajectory of LoRA, mitigating knowledge conflicts with the pretrained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that even at very high degree of sparsity ($\le$ 5%), our method simultaneously enhances generalization and downstream task performance. This confirms that our approach effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting issue and further promotes knowledge harmonization in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Although promising, existing heuristic mRAGs typically predefined fixed retrieval processes, which causes two issues: (1) Non-adaptive Retrieval Queries. (2) Overloaded Retrieval Queries. However, these flaws cannot be adequately reflected by current knowledge-seeking visual question answering (VQA) datasets, since the most required knowledge can be readily obtained with a standard two-step retrieval. To bridge the dataset gap, we first construct Dyn-VQA dataset, consisting of three types of "dynamic" questions, which require complex knowledge retrieval strategies variable in query, tool, and time: (1) Questions with rapidly changing answers. (2) Questions requiring multi-modal knowledge. (3) Multi-hop questions. Experiments on Dyn-VQA reveal that existing heuristic mRAGs struggle to provide sufficient and precisely relevant knowledge for dynamic questions due to their rigid retrieval processes. Hence, we further propose the first self-adaptive planning agent for multimodal retrieval, OmniSearch. The underlying idea is to emulate the human behavior in question solution which dynamically decomposes complex multimodal questions into sub-question chains with retrieval action. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of our OmniSearch, also provide direction for advancing mRAG.

With the rapid growth of observability techniques, various methods have been proposed to achieve failure diagnosis, including root cause localization and failure type identification, by leveraging diverse monitoring data such as logs, metrics, or traces. However, traditional failure diagnosis methods that use single-modal data can hardly cover all failure scenarios due to the restricted information. Several failure diagnosis methods have been recently proposed to integrate multimodal data based on deep learning. These methods, however, tend to combine modalities indiscriminately and treat them equally in failure diagnosis, ignoring the relationship between specific modalities and different diagnostic tasks. This oversight hinders the effective utilization of the unique advantages offered by each modality. To address the limitation, we propose \textit{TVDiag}, a multimodal failure diagnosis framework for locating culprit microservice instances and identifying their failure types (e.g., Net-packets Corruption) in microservice-based systems. \textit{TVDiag} employs task-oriented learning to enhance the potential advantages of each modality and establishes cross-modal associations based on contrastive learning to extract view-invariant failure information. Furthermore, we develop a graph-level data augmentation strategy that randomly inactivates the observability of some normal microservice instances during training to mitigate the shortage of training data. Experimental results show that \textit{TVDiag} outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multimodal failure diagnosis, achieving at least a 55.94\% higher $HR@1$ accuracy and over a 4.08\% increase in F1-score across two datasets.</p></details> | 32 pages |

This paper introduces Contextual Understanding and Enhanced Search with MLLM (CUE-M), a novel multimodal search framework that addresses these challenges through a multi-stage pipeline comprising image context enrichment, intent refinement, contextual query generation, external API integration, and relevance-based filtering. CUE-M incorporates a robust filtering pipeline combining image-based, text-based, and multimodal classifiers, dynamically adapting to instance- and category-specific concern defined by organizational policies.

By empowering LLMs to perceive external environments, integrate multimodal information, and interact with various tools, these agentic systems exhibit greater autonomy and adaptability across complex tasks. This evolution brings new opportunities to recommender systems (RS): LLM-based Agentic RS (LLM-ARS) can offer more interactive, context-aware, and proactive recommendations, potentially reshaping the user experience and broadening the application scope of RS. Despite promising early results, fundamental challenges remain, including how to effectively incorporate external knowledge, balance autonomy with controllability, and evaluate performance in dynamic, multimodal settings. In this perspective paper, we first present a systematic analysis of LLM-ARS: (1) clarifying core concepts and architectures; (2) highlighting how agentic capabilities -- such as planning, memory, and multimodal reasoning -- can enhance recommendation quality; and (3) outlining key research questions in areas such as safety, efficiency, and lifelong personalization. We also discuss open problems and future directions, arguing that LLM-ARS will drive the next wave of RS innovation. Ultimately, we foresee a paradigm shift toward intelligent, autonomous, and collaborative recommendation experiences that more closely align with users' evolving needs and complex decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |

However, as the scale of LMMs continues to grow, fully fine-tuning these models has become highly parameter-intensive. Although Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been introduced to reduce the number of tunable parameters, a significant performance gap remains compared to full fine-tuning. Furthermore, existing PEFT approaches are often highly parameterized, making them difficult to interpret and control. In light of this, we introduce Multimodal Representation Tuning (MRT), a novel approach that focuses on directly editing semantically rich multimodal representations to achieve strong performance and provide intuitive control over LMMs. Empirical results show that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines with significant performance gains (e.g., 1580.40 MME score) while requiring substantially fewer tunable parameters (e.g., 0.03% parameters). Additionally, we conduct experiments on editing instrumental tokens within multimodal representations, demonstrating that direct manipulation of these representations enables simple yet effective control over network behavior.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing GeoFMs primarily focus on overhead remote sensing (RS) data while neglecting other data modalities such as ground-level imagery. A key challenge in multimodal GeoFM development is to explicitly model geospatial relationships across modalities, which enables generalizability across tasks, spatial scales, and temporal contexts. To address these limitations, we propose GAIR, a novel multimodal GeoFM architecture integrating overhead RS data, street view (SV) imagery, and their geolocation metadata. We utilize three factorized neural encoders to project an SV image, its geolocation, and an RS image into the embedding space. The SV image needs to be located within the RS image's spatial footprint but does not need to be at its geographic center. In order to geographically align the SV image and RS image, we propose a novel implicit neural representations (INR) module that learns a continuous RS image representation and looks up the RS embedding at the SV image's geolocation. Next, these geographically aligned SV embedding, RS embedding, and location embedding are trained with contrastive learning objectives from unlabeled data. We evaluate GAIR across 10 geospatial tasks spanning RS image-based, SV image-based, and location embedding-based benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that GAIR outperforms state-of-the-art GeoFMs and other strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in learning generalizable and transferable geospatial representations.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot. Notably, we claim that M3 is the first work to address the core compression challenges in 3D feature distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 homepage: https://m3-spatial-memory.github.io code: https://github.com/MaureenZOU/m3-spatial</p></details> |

Yet, without vast amounts of spatial supervision, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle at this task. In this paper, we introduce TWIST & SCOUT, a framework that equips pre-trained MLLMs with visual grounding ability without forgetting their existing image and language understanding skills. To this end, we propose TWIST, a twin-expert stepwise tuning module that modifies the decoder of the language model using one frozen module pre-trained on image understanding tasks and another learnable one for visual grounding tasks. This allows the MLLM to retain previously learned knowledge and skills, while acquiring what is missing. To fine-tune the model effectively, we generate a high-quality synthetic dataset we call SCOUT, which mimics human reasoning in visual grounding. This dataset provides rich supervision signals, describing a step-by-step multimodal reasoning process, thereby simplifying the task of visual grounding. We evaluate our approach on several standard benchmark datasets, encompassing grounded image captioning, zero-shot localization, and visual grounding tasks. Our method consistently delivers strong performance across all tasks, while retaining the pre-trained image understanding capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we propose eXpand temporal Shift (X-ShiftNet) convolutional architectures for RGB and pose streams to capture spatio-temporal features from RGB videos and their skeleton sequences. The X-ShiftNet tackles the high computational cost of the 3D CNNs by integrating the Temporal Shift Module (TSM) into an efficient 2D CNN, enabling efficient spatiotemporal learning. Then skeleton features are utilized to guide the visual network stream, focusing on keyframes and their salient spatial regions using the proposed spatial-temporal attention block. Finally, the predictions of the two streams are fused for final classification. The experimental results show that our method, with a significant reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs), outperforms and competes with the state-of-the-art methods on NTU RGB-D 60, NTU RGB-D 120, PKU-MMD, and Toyota SmartHome datasets.

LMs have a wide range of applications in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including autocomplete and machine translation. Although larger datasets typically enhance LM performance, scalability remains a challenge due to constraints in computational power and resources. Distributed computing strategies offer essential solutions for improving scalability and managing the growing computational demand. Further, the use of sensitive datasets in training and deployment raises significant privacy concerns. Recent research has focused on developing decentralized techniques to enable distributed training and inference while utilizing diverse computational resources and enabling edge AI. This paper presents a survey on distributed solutions for various LMs, including large language models (LLMs), vision language models (VLMs), multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and small language models (SLMs). While LLMs focus on processing and generating text, MLLMs are designed to handle multiple modalities of data (e.g., text, images, and audio) and to integrate them for broader applications. To this end, this paper reviews key advancements across the MLLM pipeline, including distributed training, inference, fine-tuning, and deployment, while also identifying the contributions, limitations, and future areas of improvement. Further, it categorizes the literature based on six primary focus areas of decentralization. Our analysis describes gaps in current methodologies for enabling distributed solutions for LMs and outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for novel solutions to enhance the robustness and applicability of distributed LMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing unimodal datasets lack scale and diversity, limiting deep learning solutions. This paper proposes MapGlue, a universal MRSI matching framework, and MapData, a large-scale multimodal dataset addressing these gaps. Our contributions are twofold. MapData, a globally diverse dataset spanning 233 sampling points, offers original images (7,000x5,000 to 20,000x15,000 pixels). After rigorous cleaning, it provides 121,781 aligned electronic map-visible image pairs (512x512 pixels) with hybrid manual-automated ground truth, addressing the scarcity of scalable multimodal benchmarks. MapGlue integrates semantic context with a dual graph-guided mechanism to extract cross-modal invariant features. This structure enables global-to-local interaction, enhancing descriptor robustness against modality-specific distortions. Extensive evaluations on MapData and five public datasets demonstrate MapGlue's superiority in matching accuracy under complex conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MapGlue generalizes effectively to unseen modalities without retraining, highlighting its adaptability.

| **[Defending Multimodal Backdoored Models by Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20392v2)** | 2025-03-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.20392v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal contrastive learning models (e.g., CLIP) can learn high-quality representations from large-scale image-text datasets, yet they exhibit significant vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks, raising serious safety concerns. In this paper, we disclose that CLIP's vulnerabilities primarily stem from its excessive encoding of class-irrelevant features, which can compromise the model's visual feature resistivity to input perturbations, making it more susceptible to capturing the trigger patterns inserted by backdoor attacks. Inspired by this finding, we propose Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning (RVPT), a novel defense approach that employs specially designed deep visual prompt tuning and feature-repelling loss to eliminate excessive class-irrelevant features while simultaneously optimizing cross-entropy loss to maintain clean accuracy. Unlike existing multimodal backdoor defense methods that typically require the availability of poisoned data or involve fine-tuning the entire model, RVPT leverages few-shot downstream clean samples and only tunes a small number of parameters. Empirical results demonstrate that RVPT tunes only 0.27\% of the parameters relative to CLIP, yet it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing the attack success rate from 67.53\% to 2.76\% against SoTA attacks and effectively generalizing its defensive capabilities across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |

This process often involves multiple sequential and interconnected transformations, which must be well-documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the use of transformation trees as a method for structured recording and management of these transformations. This approach has been implemented in the dpVision software and uses a dedicated .dpw file format to store hierarchical relationships between images, transformations, and motion data. Transformation trees allow precise tracking of all image processing steps, reduce the need to store multiple copies of the same data, and enable the indirect registration of images that do not share common reference points. This improves the reproducibility of the analyses and facilitates later processing and integration of images from different sources. The practical application of this method is demonstrated with examples from orthodontics, including the integration of 3D face scans, intraoral scans, and CBCT images, as well as the documentation of mandibular motion. Beyond orthodontics, this method can be applied in other fields that require systematic management of image registration processes, such as maxillofacial surgery, oncology, and biomechanical analysis. Maintaining long-term data consistency is essential for both scientific research and clinical practice. It enables easier comparison of results in longitudinal studies, improves retrospective analysis, and supports the development of artificial intelligence algorithms by providing standardized and well-documented datasets. The proposed approach enhances data organization, allows for efficient analysis, and facilitates the reuse of information in future studies and diagnostic procedures.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |

While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been the predominant approach to enhance MLLM capabilities in task-specific optimization, it often falls short in fostering crucial generalized reasoning abilities. Despite the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to address these limitations, it faces two issues: (1) its generalized capabilities in multimodal tasks remain underexplored. (2) its training constraints such as constant Kullback-Leibler or clamp strategy easily lead to suboptimal bottleneck. To adress these issues, we introduce OThink-MR1, a framework that extends RL to MLLMs, enabling them to achieve deeper understanding and reasoning across multimodal tasks. We design a dynamic Kullback-Leibler strategy that significantly enhances RL performance, surpassing SFT in same-task evaluations. Also, we are the first to reveal that RL exhibits remarkable cross-task generalization capabilities, which shows that models post-trained with RL on one multimodal task can be effectively transfered to another tasks. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the great reasoning ability of our proposed OThink-MR1.</p></details> |  |

They have pictorial ideographic features, and their symbols carry rich cultural and contextual information. Due to the lack of relevant datasets, existing research has difficulty in advancing the study of semantic understanding of Dongba pictographs. To this end, we propose \textbf{DongbaMIE}, the first multimodal dataset for semantic understanding and extraction of Dongba pictographs, consisting of Dongba pictograph images and corresponding Chinese semantic annotations. DongbaMIE contains 23,530 sentence-level and 2,539 paragraph-level images, covering four semantic dimensions: objects, actions, relations, and attributes. We systematically evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0, and Qwen2-VL. Experimental results show that best F1 scores of proprietary models, GPT-4o and Gemini, for object extraction task are only 3.16 and 3.11 respectively. For the open-source model Qwen2-VL, it achieves only 11.49 after supervised fine-tuning.

However, multimodal frameworks often entangle these representations, limiting interpretability and potentially suppressing discriminative features. To address this, we propose Disentangled and Interpretable Multimodal Attention Fusion (DIMAF), a multimodal framework that separates the intra- and inter-modal interactions within an attention-based fusion mechanism to learn distinct modality-specific and modality-shared representations. We introduce a loss based on Distance Correlation to promote disentanglement between these representations and integrate Shapley additive explanations to assess their relative contributions to survival prediction. We evaluate DIMAF on four public cancer survival datasets, achieving a relative average improvement of 1.85% in performance and 23.7% in disentanglement compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal models. Beyond improved performance, our interpretable framework enables a deeper exploration of the underlying interactions between and within modalities in cancer biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

As research in multimodal stimuli and neuroscience advances, fMRI-based brain decoding has become a key tool for understanding brain perception and its complex cognitive processes. Decoding brain signals to reconstruct stimuli not only reveals intricate neural mechanisms but also drives progress in AI, disease treatment, and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advancements in neuroimaging and image generation models have significantly improved fMRI-based decoding. While fMRI offers high spatial resolution for precise brain activity mapping, its low temporal resolution and signal noise pose challenges. Meanwhile, techniques like GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models have enhanced reconstructed image quality, and multimodal pre-trained models have boosted cross-modal decoding tasks. This survey systematically reviews recent progress in fMRI-based brain decoding, focusing on stimulus reconstruction from passive brain signals.

This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs through post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipelines, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4V) in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: While the two-stage training--initially on image-caption pairs followed by visual instruction tasks--is commonly adopted for developing general MLLMs, we apply a single-stage training pipeline to enhance task diversity for domain-specific post-training. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Furthermore, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the differing levels of features prioritized by multimodal understanding and generation tasks, joint training methods face significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses this challenge through Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook which builds texture sub-codebooks on pre-trained semantic codebook. This design decouples the training of semantic reconstruction and pixel reconstruction and equips the tokenizer with low-level texture feature extraction capability without degradation of high-level semantic feature extraction ability.

However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</p></details> |  |

This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, a generalizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can incorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio, thermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality. It projects diverse modality features to the LLM token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types for response generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel progressive multimodal fusion design supported by a lightweight fusion module and modality-sequential training strategy. It helps compress information across various assisting modalities, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM while improving performance. We validate our method on 7 video-language reasoning tasks assisted by diverse modalities, including conventional VideoQA and Video-Audio/3D/Touch/Thermal QA, and achieve better/equivalent performance against strong multimodal LLMs, including OneLLM, BLIP-2, and SeViLA while reducing over 90% trainable parameters.

Existing KD-based methods for multimodal AD that use fused multimodal features to obtain teacher representations face challenges. Anomalies in one modality may not be effectively captured in the fused teacher features, leading to detection failures. Besides, these methods do not fully leverage the rich intra- and inter-modality information. In this paper, we propose Crossmodal Reverse Distillation (CRD) based on Multi-branch design to realize Multimodal Industrial AD. By assigning independent branches to each modality, our method enables finer detection of anomalies within each modality. Furthermore, we enhance the interaction between modalities during the distillation process by designing Crossmodal Filter and Amplifier. With the idea of crossmodal mapping, the student network is allowed to better learn normal features while anomalies in all modalities are ensured to be effectively detected. Experimental verifications on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal anomaly detection and localization.</p></details> |  |

However, there are scenarios where retrieving visual information is either more beneficial or easier to access than textual data. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation benchmark, MRAG-Bench, in which we systematically identify and categorize scenarios where visually augmented knowledge is better than textual knowledge, for instance, more images from varying viewpoints. MRAG-Bench consists of 16,130 images and 1,353 human-annotated multiple-choice questions across 9 distinct scenarios. With MRAG-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of 10 open-source and 4 proprietary large vision-language models (LVLMs). Our results show that all LVLMs exhibit greater improvements when augmented with images compared to textual knowledge, confirming that MRAG-Bench is vision-centric. Additionally, we conduct extensive analysis with MRAG-Bench, which offers valuable insights into retrieval-augmented LVLMs. Notably, the top-performing model, GPT-4o, faces challenges in effectively leveraging retrieved knowledge, achieving only a 5.82% improvement with ground-truth information, in contrast to a 33.16% improvement observed in human participants. These findings highlight the importance of MRAG-Bench in encouraging the community to enhance LVLMs' ability to utilize retrieved visual knowledge more effectively.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

We introduce ViBe (https://vibe-t2v-bench.github.io/): a large-scale dataset of hallucinated videos from open-source T2V models. We identify five major hallucination types: Vanishing Subject, Omission Error, Numeric Variability, Subject Dysmorphia, and Visual Incongruity. Using ten T2V models, we generated and manually annotated 3,782 videos from 837 diverse MS COCO captions. Our proposed benchmark includes a dataset of hallucinated videos and a classification framework using video embeddings. ViBe serves as a critical resource for evaluating T2V reliability and advancing hallucination detection. We establish classification as a baseline, with the TimeSFormer + CNN ensemble achieving the best performance (0.345 accuracy, 0.342 F1 score). While initial baselines proposed achieve modest accuracy, this highlights the difficulty of automated hallucination detection and the need for improved methods.

Prior research using text-only models have struggled to address this problem in a reliable and scalable way due to (1) limited reasoning capabilities, (2) information loss from converting visual records to text, and (3) lack of a generic EHR integration to extract patient data. Methods: We introduce a broadly applicable, integration-free, LLM-powered pipeline that automates patient-trial matching using unprocessed documents extracted from EHRs. Our approach leverages (1) the new reasoning-LLM paradigm, enabling the assessment of even the most complex criteria, (2) visual capabilities of latest LLMs to interpret medical records without lossy image-to-text conversions, and (3) multimodal embeddings for efficient medical record search. The pipeline was validated on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection dataset (288 diabetic patients) and a real-world dataset composed of 485 patients from 30 different sites matched against 36 diverse trials. Results: On the n2c2 dataset, our method achieved a new state-of-the-art criterion-level accuracy of 93\%. In real-world trials, the pipeline yielded an accuracy of 87\%, undermined by the difficulty to replicate human decision-making when medical records lack sufficient information. Nevertheless, users were able to review overall eligibility in under 9 minutes per patient on average, representing an 80\% improvement over traditional manual chart reviews. Conclusion: This pipeline demonstrates robust performance in clinical trial patient matching without requiring custom integration with site systems or trial-specific tailoring, thereby enabling scalable deployment across sites seeking to leverage AI for patient matching.</p></details> |  |

We formulate this as an inverse problem and show that under certain conditions perfect alignment can be achieved. We then address a specific application of alignment referred to as cross-modal transfer. Unsupervised cross-modal transfer aims to leverage a model trained with one modality to perform inference on another modality, without any labeled fine-tuning on the new modality. Assuming that semantic classes are represented as a mixture of Gaussians in the latent space, we show how cross-modal transfer can be performed by projecting the data points from the representation space onto different subspaces representing each modality. Our experiments on synthetic multimodal Gaussian data verify the effectiveness of our perfect alignment and cross-modal transfer method. We hope these findings inspire further exploration of the applications of perfect alignment and the use of Gaussian models for cross-modal learning.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and robust registration methods are essential for aligning data from different modalities, forming the foundation for multimodal sensor data fusion and enhancing perception systems' accuracy and reliability. The registration task between 2D images captured by cameras and 3D point clouds captured by Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors is usually treated as a visual pose estimation problem. High-dimensional feature similarities from different modalities are leveraged to identify pixel-point correspondences, followed by pose estimation techniques using least squares methods. However, existing approaches often resort to downsampling the original point cloud and image data due to computational constraints, inevitably leading to a loss in precision. Additionally, high-dimensional features extracted using different feature extractors from various modalities require specific techniques to mitigate cross-modal differences for effective matching. To address these challenges, we propose a method that uses edge information from the original point clouds and images for cross-modal registration. We retain crucial information from the original data by extracting edge points and pixels, enhancing registration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The use of edge points and edge pixels allows us to introduce an attention-based feature exchange block to eliminate cross-modal disparities. Furthermore, we incorporate an optimal matching layer to improve correspondence identification. We validate the accuracy of our method on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

While recent work has explored unlearning in Euclidean contrastive vision-language models, the effectiveness of concept removal in hyperbolic spaces remains unexplored. This paper investigates machine unlearning in hyperbolic contrastive learning by adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU, a model that embeds images and text in hyperbolic space to better capture semantic hierarchies. Through systematic experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that hyperbolic geometry offers distinct advantages for concept removal, achieving near perfect forgetting with reasonable performance on retained concepts, particularly when scaling to multiple concept removal. Our approach introduces hyperbolic-specific components including entailment calibration and norm regularization that leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space. Comparative analysis with Euclidean models reveals fundamental differences in unlearning dynamics, with hyperbolic unlearning reorganizing the semantic hierarchy while Euclidean approaches merely disconnect cross-modal associations. These findings not only advance machine unlearning techniques but also provide insights into the geometric properties that influence concept representation and removal in multimodal models.

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guidance-base Diffusion Models for Improving Photoacoustic Image Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06354v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06354v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic(PA) imaging is a non-destructive and non-invasive technology for visualizing minute blood vessel structures in the body using ultrasonic sensors. In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Free-hand 3D Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Reconstruction using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03505v1)** | 2025-02-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.03505v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a motion-based learning network with a global-local self-attention module (MoGLo-Net) to enhance 3D reconstruction in handheld photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging. Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact: Self-incentive artifact removal for photoacoustic imaging without any data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14873v2)** | 2024-12-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.14873v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) uniquely combines optical contrast with the penetration depth of ultrasound, making it critical for clinical applications. However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v4)** | 2024-12-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.19224v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[4D SlingBAG: spatial-temporal coupled Gaussian ball for large-scale dynamic 3D photoacoustic iterative reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03898v1)** | 2024-12-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.03898v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale dynamic three-dimensional (3D) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is significantly important in clinical applications. In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG): point cloud-based iterative algorithm for large-scale 3D photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11781v3)** | 2024-11-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.11781v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale 3D photoacoustic (PA) imaging has become increasingly important for both clinical and pre-clinical applications. Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging Systems: The Bayesian Cramér-Rao Bound Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09557v1)** | 2024-10-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.09557v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution imaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and blood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.03663v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2404.07833v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2306.11034v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |
