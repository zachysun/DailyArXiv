| **[BRIDGE: Bootstrapping Text to Control Time-Series Generation via Multi-Agent Iterative Optimization and Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02445v7)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.02445v7) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by up to 12% on MSE and 6% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[BEDTime: A Unified Benchmark for Automatically Describing Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05215v1)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.05215v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1) recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1) popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected, identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Causality for Enhanced Prediction of Web Traffic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00612v2)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.00612v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting web service traffic has significant social value, as it can be applied to various practical scenarios, including but not limited to dynamic resource scaling, load balancing, system anomaly detection, service-level agreement compliance, and fraud detection. Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>time ...</summary><p>time series, web service, web traffic, causality, more experiments</p></details> |

However, it is not well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects (RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout pretraining.</p></details> |  |

Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance compared to single-model and na\"ive ensemble baselines. In addition, we explore using MUSE as guided signals with chain-of-thought distillation to fine-tune LLMs for calibration. MUSE is available at:https://github.com/LARK-NLP-Lab/MUSE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Existing work often lacks scalability and fails to leverage diverse, large-scale course content, with limited frameworks for assessing pedagogic quality. To this end, we propose WikiHowAgent, a multi-agent workflow leveraging LLMs to simulate interactive teaching-learning conversations. It integrates teacher and learner agents, an interaction manager, and an evaluator to facilitate procedural learning and assess pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics. Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains. Our datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Simulate Personas with Reversed Performance? A Benchmark for Counterfactual Instruction Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06460v2)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.06460v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are now increasingly widely used to simulate personas in virtual environments, leveraging their instruction-following capability. However, we discovered that even state-of-the-art LLMs cannot simulate personas with reversed performance (e.g., student personas with low proficiency in educational settings), which impairs the simulation diversity and limits the practical applications of the simulated environments. In this work, using mathematical reasoning as a representative scenario, we propose the first benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs on simulating personas with reversed performance, a capability that we dub "counterfactual instruction following". We evaluate both open-weight and closed-source LLMs on this task and find that LLMs, including the OpenAI o1 reasoning model, all struggle to follow counterfactual instructions for simulating reversedly performing personas. Intersectionally simulating both the performance level and the race population of a persona worsens the effect even further. These results highlight the challenges of counterfactual instruction following and the need for further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[First Steps Towards Overhearing LLM Agents: A Case Study With Dungeons & Dragons Gameplay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22809v2)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.22809v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

| **[PersonaGym: Evaluating Persona Agents and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18416v5)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.18416v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persona agents, which are LLM agents conditioned to act according to an assigned persona, enable contextually rich and user aligned interactions across domains like education and healthcare. However, evaluating how faithfully these agents adhere to their personas remains a significant challenge, particularly in free-form settings that demand consistency across diverse, persona-relevant environments. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for persona agents, and PersonaScore, a human-aligned automatic metric grounded in decision theory that enables comprehensive large-scale evaluation. Our evaluation of 10 leading LLMs across 200 personas and 10,000 questions reveals significant advancement opportunities. For example, GPT-4.1 had the exact same PersonaScore as LLaMA-3-8b despite being a more recent and advanced closed source model. Importantly, increased model size and complexity do not necessarily enhance persona agent capabilities, underscoring the need for algorithmic and architectural innovation toward faithful, performant persona agents.</p></details> | EMNLP Findings 2025 |
| **[ParEval-Repo: A Benchmark Suite for Evaluating LLMs with Repository-level HPC Translation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20938v2)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.20938v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPGPU architectures have become significantly more diverse in recent years, which has led to an emergence of a variety of specialized programming models and software stacks to support them. Portable programming models exist, but they require significant developer effort to port to and optimize for different hardware architectures. Large language models (LLMs) may help to reduce this programmer burden. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark and testing framework, ParEval-Repo, which can be used to evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based approaches in automatically translating entire codebases across GPGPU execution models. ParEval-Repo includes several scientific computing and AI mini-applications in a range of programming models and levels of repository complexity. We use ParEval-Repo to evaluate a range of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial LLMs, with both a non-agentic and a top-down agentic approach. We assess code generated by the LLMs and approaches in terms of compilability, functional correctness, categories of build errors, and the cost of translation in terms of the number of inference tokens. Our results demonstrate that LLM translation of scientific applications is feasible for small programs but difficulty with generating functional build systems and cross-file dependencies pose challenges in scaling to larger codebases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Triadic Fusion of Cognitive, Functional, and Causal Dimensions for Explainable LLMs: The TAXAL Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05199v1)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.05199v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs, do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of agentic LLMs. We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive (user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing, evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings. Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services, showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and stakeholder roles. By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways, TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice, supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of agentic AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 9 tables and 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[TECP: Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00461v2)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.00461v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets, outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM settings.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the interaction of three complementary approaches to advance shared autonomy in heterogeneous marine robotic fleets: (i) the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate intuitive high-level task specification and support hull inspection missions, (ii) the implementation of human-in-the-loop interaction frameworks in multi-agent settings to enable adaptive and intent-aware coordination, and (iii) the development of a modular Mission Manager based on Behavior Trees to provide interpretable and flexible mission control. Preliminary results from simulation and real-world lake-like environments demonstrate the potential of this multi-layered architecture to reduce operator cognitive load, enhance transparency, and improve adaptive behaviour alignment with human intent. Ongoing work focuses on fully integrating these components, refining coordination mechanisms, and validating the system in operational port scenarios. This study contributes to establishing a modular and scalable foundation for trustworthy, human-collaborative autonomy in safety-critical maritime robotics applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we formalize the notion of Ignorance Awareness and illustrate that conventional fine-tuning methods can result in substantial activation displacement. This displacement undermines the critical capability of ignorance awareness, leading to undesirable behaviors such as hallucinations. To address this challenge, we introduce SEAT, a simple and principled fine-tuning approach that not only enables the model to effectively acquire new knowledge instances but also preserves its aligned ignorance awareness. SEAT integrates two key components: (1) sparse tuning that constrains activation drift, and (2) a novel entity perturbation method designed to counter knowledge entanglement. Experimental results demonstrate that, across both real-world and synthetic datasets, SEAT significantly outperforms baselines in preserving ignorance awareness while retaining optimal fine-tuning performance, offering a more robust solution for LLM fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Our approach reduces reliance on large-scale data and incorporates a robot-agnostic pipeline that embodies an LLM. Our framework, InteLiPlan, ensures that the LLM's decision-making capabilities are effectively aligned with robotic functions, enhancing operational robustness and adaptability, while our human-in-the-loop mechanism allows for real-time human intervention when user instruction is required. We evaluate our method in both simulation and on the real Toyota Human Support Robot and Anymal D-Unitree Z1 platforms. Our method achieves a 95% success rate in the 'fetch me' task completion with failure recovery, highlighting its capability in both failure reasoning and task planning. InteLiPlan achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art large-scale LLM-based robotics planners, while using only real-time onboard computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoPDL: Automatic Prompt Optimization for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04365v3)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.04365v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot, CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations). Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and specific to a given LLM and task. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discovering good LLM agent configurations. Our approach frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and seven LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.21\pm15.46$ percentage points), up to 67.5pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.</p></details> |  |

With auxiliary modules and planning cores, LLM-enabled agents can autonomously plan and take actions to deal with diverse environment semantics and user intentions. However, the limited resources of individual network devices significantly hinder the efficient operation of LLM-enabled agents with complex tool calls, highlighting the urgent need for efficient multi-level device collaborations. To this end, the framework and method of the LLM-enabled multi-agent system with dual-loop terminal-edge collaborations are proposed in 6G networks. Firstly, the outer loop consists of the iterative collaborations between the global agent and multiple sub-agents deployed on edge servers and terminals, where the planning capability is enhanced through task decomposition and parallel sub-task distribution. Secondly, the inner loop utilizes sub-agents with dedicated roles to circularly reason, execute, and replan the sub-task, and the parallel tool calling generation with offloading strategies is incorporated to improve efficiency. The improved task planning capability and task execution efficiency are validated through the conducted case study in 6G-supported urban safety governance. Finally, the open challenges and future directions are thoroughly analyzed in 6G networks, accelerating the advent of the 6G era.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

We introduce DuET-PD (Dual Evaluation for Trust in Persuasive Dialogues), a framework evaluating multi-turn stance-change dynamics across dual dimensions: persuasion type (corrective/misleading) and domain (knowledge via MMLU-Pro, and safety via SALAD-Bench). We find that even a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o achieves only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasions. Moreover, results reveal a concerning trend of increasing sycophancy in newer open-source models. To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting or resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to misinformation and receptiveness to corrections, improving Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts from 4.21% to 76.54%. These contributions offer a pathway to developing more reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue.

Agents must not only gather and interpret vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources, weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and predictive thinking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, 51 pages.

Traditional evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.</p></details> |  |

AnyGPT can be trained stably without any alterations to the current large language model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of new languages. We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language model.

OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states. Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression style, using learned strategies.

It is the process of assigning a code from a medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes. Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 Figures, to be published in Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing, RANLP 2025</p></details> |

While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be the simplest.

However, the soaring energy cost of LLM inference presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment. This paper introduces VoltanaLLM, a system for SLO-aware, energy-efficient LLM serving, built from a control theory perspective. VoltanaLLM co-designs frequency scaling and request routing in emerging prefill/decode disaggregated architectures, leveraging their decoupled execution to enable fine-grained phase-specific control. It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller that dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled instances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM in SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to 36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving the way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving.</p></details> |  |

We present a systematic study of personality control using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles, reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU, GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either do not take advantage of recent developments in multimodal Large Language Models (LLM) or do not consider challenges in localization uncertainty, which is critical in embodied agents. We propose employing multimodal LLMs for long-horizon planning in conjunction with detailed motion planning using our information-based objective. By leveraging high-quality view synthesis from our 3DGS representation, our method employs a multimodal LLM as a zero-shot planner for long-horizon exploration goals from the semantic perspective. We also introduce an uncertainty-aware path proposal and selection algorithm that balances the dual objectives of maximizing the information gain for the environment while minimizing the cost of localization errors. Experiments conducted on the Gibson and Habitat-Matterport 3D datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results of the proposed method.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

We investigate this question by giving models the option to bail out of interactions using three different bail methods: a bail tool the model can call, a bail string the model can output, and a bail prompt that asks the model if it wants to leave. On continuations of real world data (Wildchat and ShareGPT), all three of these bail methods find models will bail around 0.28-32\% of the time (depending on the model and bail method). However, we find that bail rates can depend heavily on the model used for the transcript, which means we may be overestimating real world bail rates by up to 4x. If we also take into account false positives on bail prompt (22\%), we estimate real world bail rates range from 0.06-7\%, depending on the model and bail method. We use observations from our continuations of real world data to construct a non-exhaustive taxonomy of bail cases, and use this taxonomy to construct BailBench: a representative synthetic dataset of situations where some models bail. We test many models on this dataset, and observe some bail behavior occurring for most of them. Bail rates vary substantially between models, bail methods, and prompt wordings. Finally, we study the relationship between refusals and bails. We find: 1) 0-13\% of continuations of real world conversations resulted in a bail without a corresponding refusal 2) Jailbreaks tend to decrease refusal rates, but increase bail rates 3) Refusal abliteration increases no-refuse bail rates, but only for some bail methods 4) Refusal rate on BailBench does not appear to predict bail rate.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning and reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present \textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.</p></details> |  |

To address this, this paper proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions, building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model, we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions. After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex questions.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior. Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ma...</summary><p>We make public all code and source data at https://github.com/psychology-of-AI/Personality-Illusion for full reproducibility</p></details> |

Constrained LLM generation is a promising direction to enforce adherence to formal grammar, but prior works have empirically observed that strict enforcement of formal constraints often diminishes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical explanation for why constraining LLM outputs to very restrictive grammars that only allow syntactically valid final answers reduces the reasoning capabilities of the model. Second, we demonstrate that by augmenting the output grammar with carefully designed additional rules, it is always possible to preserve the reasoning capabilities of the LLM while ensuring syntactic and semantic correctness in its outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, CRANE, which effectively balances the correctness of constrained generation with the flexibility of unconstrained generation. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs and benchmarks show that CRANE significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art constrained decoding strategies and standard unconstrained decoding, showing up to 10% points accuracy improvement over baselines on challenging symbolic reasoning benchmarks GSM-symbolic and FOLIO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025, Code at: https://github.com/uiuc-focal-lab/CRANE</p></details> |

However, its effectiveness in real-world settings is challenged by the need to incorporate context-specific predictions and expert instructions, which traditional MPC often neglects. We propose InstructMPC, a novel framework that addresses this gap by integrating real-time human instructions through a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware predictions for MPC. Our method employs a Language-to-Distribution (L2D) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the MPC optimization. Unlike existing context-aware and language-based MPC models, InstructMPC enables dynamic human-LLM interaction and fine-tunes the L2D module in a closed loop with theoretical performance guarantees, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via advanced fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using a tailored loss function.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel multi-modal detection pipeline that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to flag misleading thumbnails. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of 2,843 videos from eight countries, including 1,359 misleading thumbnail videos that collectively amassed over 7.6 billion views -- providing a unique cross-cultural perspective on this global issue. Our detection pipeline integrates video-to-text descriptions, thumbnail images, and subtitle transcripts to holistically analyze content and flag misleading thumbnails. Through extensive experimentation and prompt engineering, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5 Flash. Our findings show the effectiveness of LLMs in identifying misleading thumbnails, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet consistently showing strong performance, achieving an accuracy of 93.8\%, precision over 92\%, and recall exceeding 94\% in certain scenarios. We discuss the implications of our findings for content moderation, user experience, and the ethical considerations of deploying such systems at scale. Our findings pave the way for more transparent, trustworthy video platforms and stronger content integrity for audiences worldwide.</p></details> |  |

As existing LLMs are often built from base models or other pre-trained models and use external datasets, they can inevitably inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components that exist in previous models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand these components' origin and development process to detect potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks. Motivated by that, this project aims to study such relationships between models and datasets, which are the central parts of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a methodology to systematically collect LLMs' supply chain information. Then, we design a new graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, which is a directed heterogeneous graph, having 402,654 nodes and 462,524 edges. Lastly, we perform different types of analysis and make multiple interesting findings.</p></details> |  |

We present ODKE+, a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195 predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9 million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with 98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad real-world applicability.

Despite the growing number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs, including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4 reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a comparative performance with reasoning-based models.

Our method leverages the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD. Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$ when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as negatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |

We propose a framework that extends this principle to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation. Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a controlled biological substrate.</p></details> |  |

However, these benchmarks evaluate models solely based on final numerical answers, neglecting rigorous reasoning and proof generation which are essential for real-world mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation of full-solution reasoning for challenging mathematical problems. Using expert human annotators, we evaluated several state-of-the-art reasoning models on the six problems from the 2025 USAMO within hours of their release. Our results reveal that all tested models struggled significantly: only Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves a non-trivial score of 25%, while all other models achieve less than 5%. Through detailed analysis of reasoning traces, we identify the most common failure modes and find several unwanted artifacts arising from the optimization strategies employed during model training. Overall, our results suggest that current LLMs are inadequate for rigorous mathematical reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning and proof generation capabilities.</p></details> |  |

A systematic understanding of these attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat model.

While these interfaces enhance database accessibility, most research today focuses on English, with limited evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of both foundational and finetuned LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create and release a multilingual dataset by translating English questions into Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair cross-lingual comparison. Using standardized prompts and metrics, we evaluate several foundational models and observe a consistent performance pattern: highest on English, followed by Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute this to differences in training data availability and linguistic features. We also examine the impact of translating task prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Furthermore, we finetune a foundational model on two datasets: one in English only, and one multilingual. Finetuning on English improves overall accuracy but widens the performance gap between languages. In contrast, multilingual finetuning narrows the gap, resulting in more balanced performance. Our findings highlight the importance for multilingual evaluation and training to build more inclusive and robust query generation systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ACING, an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework that formulates instruction optimization as a stateless, continuous-action problem, enabling exploration of infinite instruction spaces using only black-box feedback. ACING automatically discovers prompts that outperform human-written prompts in 76% of instruction-induction tasks, with gains of up to 33 points and a 10-point median improvement over the best automatic baseline in 33 tasks spanning instruction-induction, summarization, and chain-of-thought reasoning.

External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

Yet this very sophistication amplifies their fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning, capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions. On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving agentic AI.</p></details> |  |

However, in complex noisy environments, they still face challenges such as poor adaptability and low information utilization, resulting in limited effectiveness of GER. To address these issues, this paper proposes a noise-robust multi-modal GER framework (Denoising GER). The framework enhances the model's adaptability to different noisy scenarios through a noise-adaptive acoustic encoder and optimizes the integration of multi-modal information via a heterogeneous feature compensation dynamic fusion (HFCDF) mechanism, improving the LLM's utilization of multi-modal information. Additionally, reinforcement learning (RL) training strategies are introduced to enhance the model's predictive capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Denoising GER significantly improves accuracy and robustness in noisy environments and exhibits good generalization abilities in unseen noise scenarios.</p></details> |  |

These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and (2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance, and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this efficiency through systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2, a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B parameters, respectively. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid reasoning model, MiniCPM4.1, which can be used in both deep reasoning mode and non-reasoning mode. Evaluation results demonstrate that MiniCPM4 and MiniCPM4.1 outperform similar-sized open-source models across benchmarks, with the 8B variants showing significant speed improvements on long sequence understanding and generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MiniC...</summary><p>MiniCPM4 Technical Report</p></details> |

However, even seemingly straightforward applications of LLMs raise complex sociotechnical considerations to translate into practice. This case study, conducted at KidsAbility, a pediatric rehabilitation facility in Ontario, Canada examined the use of LLMs to support occupational therapists in reducing documentation burden.We conducted a qualitative study involving 20 clinicians who participated in pilot programs using two AI technologies: a general-purpose proprietary LLM and a bespoke model fine-tuned on proprietary historical documentation. Our findings reveal that documentation challenges are sociotechnical in nature, shaped by clinical workflows, organizational policies, and system constraints. Four key themes emerged: (1) the heterogeneity of workflows, (2) the documentation burden is systemic and not directly linked to the creation of any single type of documentation, (3) the need for flexible tools and clinician autonomy, and (4) effective implementation requires mutual learning between clinicians and AI systems. While LLMs show promise in easing documentation tasks, their success will depend on flexible, adaptive integration that supports clinician autonomy. Beyond technical performance, sustained adoption will require training programs and implementation strategies that reflect the complexity of clinical environments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we examine the allocational fairness of LLM-based hiring systems through two tasks that reflect actual HR usage: resume summarization and applicant ranking. By constructing a synthetic resume dataset with controlled perturbations and curating job postings, we investigate whether model behavior differs across demographic groups. Our findings reveal that generated summaries exhibit meaningful differences more frequently for race than for gender perturbations. Models also display non-uniform retrieval selection patterns across demographic groups and exhibit high ranking sensitivity to both gender and race perturbations. Surprisingly, retrieval models can show comparable sensitivity to both demographic and non-demographic changes, suggesting that fairness issues may stem from broader model brittleness. Overall, our results indicate that LLM-based hiring systems, especially in the retrieval stage, can exhibit notable biases that lead to discriminatory outcomes in real-world contexts.</p></details> |  |

We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.</p></details> |  |

While empathy-driven approaches preserve client satisfaction in benign cases, they fail catastrophically against dishonest debtors--individuals who exploit conciliatory tactics to manipulate terms or evade repayment. Blindly prioritizing "customer experience" in such scenarios leads to creditor vulnerabilities: revenue leakage, moral hazard, and systemic exploitation. To address this, we propose EQ-Knight, an LLM agent that dynamically optimizes emotional strategy to defend creditor interests. Unlike naive empathy-centric bots, EQ-Knight integrates emotion memory and game-theoretic reasoning, powered by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to track and predict debtor emotional states. By analyzing both real-time and historical emotional cues, EQ-Knight strategically counters negative emotions (e.g., aggression, feigned distress) while preserving productive debtor relationships. Experiments demonstrate EQ-Knight's superiority over conventional LLM negotiators: it achieves a 32\% reduction in concession losses without compromising recovery rates, particularly in adversarial cases where debtors weaponize negative emotions (e.g., intimidation, guilt-tripping) to coerce concessions. For credit agencies, EQ-Knight transforms LLMs from high-risk "people-pleasers" into strategic emotion-defenders--balancing emotional intelligence with tactical rigor to enforce accountability and deter exploitation.</p></details> |  |

To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains, evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling of adverse events in multi-center clinical trials, leveraging LLM-informed prior distributions. Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM, enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring and regulatory decision making.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, their effectiveness largely depends on the strategy and quality of prompting. Since decision logic is typically embedded in prompts, it becomes challenging for end users to modify or refine it. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) offers a standardized graphical approach for defining decision logic in a structured, user-friendly manner. This paper introduces a DMN-guided prompting framework that breaks down complex decision logic into smaller, manageable components, guiding LLMs through structured decision pathways. We implemented the framework in a graduate-level course where students submitted assignments. The assignments and DMN models representing feedback instructions served as inputs to our framework. The instructor evaluated the generated feedback and labeled it for performance assessment. Our approach demonstrated promising results, outperforming chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting in our case study. Students also responded positively to the generated feedback, reporting high levels of perceived usefulness in a survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Large...</summary><p>Large Language Models, Decision Model and Notation, Automated Feedback, Prompt Engineering</p></details> |

However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

Unlike traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which relies on rule-based workflows and scripting, AACU enables intelligent agents to perform tasks through natural language instructions and autonomous interaction with user interfaces. This study investigates whether AACU can serve as a viable alternative to RPA in enterprise workflow automation. We conducted controlled experiments across three standard RPA challenges data entry, monitoring, and document extraction comparing RPA (via UiPath) and AACU (via Anthropic's Computer Use Agent) in terms of speed, reliability, and development effort. Results indicate that RPA outperforms AACU in execution speed and reliability, particularly in repetitive, stable environments. However, AACU significantly reduces development time and adapts more flexibly to dynamic interfaces. While current AACU implementations are not yet production-ready, their promise in rapid prototyping and lightweight automation is evident. Future research should explore multi-agent orchestration, hybrid RPA-AACU architectures, and more robust evaluation across industries and platforms.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows. This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface. KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.</p></details> |  |

However, it is still unclear how well LLMs generalize to sophisticated and naturally occurring mathematical statements. To address this gap, we investigate the task of autoformalizing real-world mathematical definitions: a critical component of mathematical discourse. Specifically, we introduce two novel resources for autoformalization, collecting definitions from Wikipedia (Def_Wiki) and arXiv papers (Def_ArXiv). We then systematically evaluate a range of LLMs, analyzing their ability to formalize definitions into Isabelle/HOL. Furthermore, we investigate strategies to enhance LLMs' performance including refinement through external feedback from Proof Assistants, and formal definition grounding, where we augment LLMs' formalizations through relevant contextual elements from formal mathematical libraries. Our findings reveal that definitions present a greater challenge compared to existing benchmarks, such as miniF2F. In particular, we found that LLMs still struggle with self-correction, and aligning with relevant mathematical libraries. At the same time, structured refinement methods and definition grounding strategies yield notable improvements of up to 16% on self-correction capabilities and 43% on the reduction of undefined errors, highlighting promising directions for enhancing LLM-based autoformalization in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Camera-Ready Version</p></details> |

The methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.</p></details> |  |

To rigorously assess this ability, we design controlled translation experiments between English and constructed languages generated, through specific cryptographic means, from Latin or French. Contrary to previous studies, our results demonstrate that LLMs do possess a measurable capacity for explicit learning. This ability, however, diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic phenomena to be learned increases. Supervised fine-tuning on ad hoc chains of thought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to typologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point to the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning strategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs, benefiting low-resource languages typically described in grammar books but lacking extensive corpora.</p></details> |  |

Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for neurosymbolic reasoning.

New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 without compromising their utility.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 findings |

Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34 state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

Local search solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still, their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors. The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating local search solver design.</p></details> |  |

Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion, ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral, task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation, present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and multi?agent extensions.</p></details> |  |

As a result, the LLM agents generated a spontaneous motivation to go to the bar and changed their decision making by becoming a collective. We also observed that the LLM agents did not solve the problem completely, but rather behaved more like humans. These findings reveal a complex interplay between external incentives (prompt-specified constraints such as the 60\% threshold) and internal incentives (culturally-encoded social preferences derived from pre-training), demonstrating that LLM agents naturally balance formal game-theoretic rationality with social motivations that characterize human behavior. These findings suggest that a new model of group decision making, which could not be handled in the previous game-theoretic problem setting, can be realized by LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS]. However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings, especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose MultiGen, a multilingual speech generation model with child-friendly interaction, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for low-resource languages. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, which can be used to facilitate young children's communication with AI systems through culturally relevant context in three low-resource languages: Singaporean accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiGen compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | 5 pages |

To this end, we present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically, we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios.

Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

This evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new, conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.</p></details> |  |

While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at the EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Evaluating Policymaking Capabilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03827v1)** | 2025-09-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.03827v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain; Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making. If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.</p></details> |  |

To better understand such bias, we propose to decompose the preference evaluation metric, specifically the win rate, into two key components: desirability and information mass, where the former is length-independent and related to trustworthiness such as correctness, toxicity, and consistency, and the latter is length-dependent and represents the amount of information in the response. We empirically demonstrated the decomposition through controlled experiments and found that response length impacts evaluations by influencing information mass. To derive a reliable evaluation metric that assesses content quality without being confounded by response length, we propose AdapAlpaca, a simple yet effective adjustment to win rate measurement. Specifically, AdapAlpaca ensures a fair comparison of response quality by aligning the lengths of reference and test model responses under equivalent length intervals.</p></details> |  |

These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles, making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms. Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.</p></details> |  |

The movement of physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes, while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies, especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge, comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools, and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent applications in the supply chain.

However, the vast majority of academic journals are published exclusively in English, creating barriers for non-native-English-speaking researchers. In this study, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to translate published scientific articles while preserving their native JATS XML formatting, thereby developing a practical, automated approach for implementation by academic journals. Using our approach, we translate articles across multiple scientific disciplines into 28 languages. To evaluate translation accuracy, we introduce a novel question-and-answer (QA) benchmarking method, in which an LLM generates comprehension-based questions from the original text and then answers them based on the translated text. Our benchmark results show an average performance of 95.9%, showing that the key scientific details are accurately conveyed. In a user study, we translate the scientific papers of 15 researchers into their native languages, finding that the authors consistently found the translations to accurately capture the original information in their articles. Interestingly, a third of the authors found many technical terms "overtranslated," expressing a preference to keep terminology more familiar in English untranslated. Finally, we demonstrate how in-context learning techniques can be used to align translations with domain-specific preferences such as mitigating overtranslation, highlighting the adaptability and utility of LLM-driven scientific translation. The code and translated articles are available at https://hankleid.github.io/ProjectMundo.</p></details> |  |

A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper presented as an Oral at the ICML 2025 Workshop on the Impact of Memorization on Trustworthy Foundation Models</p></details> |

We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool, "hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse (BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms, measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than 50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in critical maintenance contexts.</p></details> |  |

This contrasts with the smaller, tokenized text vocabularies typically used in LLMs. The predominant view within the LLM-based recommendation literature is that it is infeasible to treat item ids as a first class citizen in the LLM and instead some sort of tokenization of an item into multiple tokens is required. However, this creates a key practical bottleneck in serving these models for real-time low-latency applications. Our paper challenges this predominant practice and integrates item ids as first class citizens into the LLM. We provide simple, yet highly effective, novel training and inference modifications that enable single-token representations of items and single-step decoding. Our method shows improvements in recommendation quality (Recall and NDCG) over existing techniques on the Amazon shopping datasets while significantly improving inference efficiency by 5x-14x. Our work offers an efficiency perspective distinct from that of other popular approaches within LLM-based recommendation, potentially inspiring further research and opening up a new direction for integrating IDs into LLMs. Our code is available here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cUMj37rV0Z1bCWMdhQ6i4q4eTRQLURtC</p></details> |  |

In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim, social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to (a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject research.

However, designing and implementing static analyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined bug patterns. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static analysis, directly applying them to scan large systems remains impractical due to computational constraints and contextual limitations. We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks scalable LLM-based static analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical bug patterns. Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive systems, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge. KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers. To date, KNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 92 new, critical, long-latent bugs (average 4.3 years) in the Linux kernel; 77 are confirmed, 57 fixed, and 30 have been assigned CVE numbers. This work establishes an entirely new paradigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for real-world systems via checker synthesis.</p></details> | SOSP 2025 |

In this paper, we identify a synergetic but overlooked opportunity to co-serve latency-critical online requests alongside latency-tolerant offline tasks such as model benchmarking. While promising, existing serving systems fail to co-serve them efficiently, as their coarse-grained resource management at the request or iteration level cannot harvest millisecond-level GPU idle cycles without introducing interference that violates online latency objectives. ConServe is a new LLM co-serving system that achieves high throughput and strong online latency guarantees by managing resources at finer granularities. ConServe introduces three techniques: (1) a latency-aware token-level scheduler that precisely sizes offline batches and tokens to fit within online latency objectives; (2) sub-iteration, layer-wise preemption that allows offline tasks to yield to online load spikes; and (3) incremental KV cache management that enables preempting and resuming offline requests at near-zero cost.

Traditional methods, including heuristic-based, e.g., First-Come-First-Served (FJFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF), or intensive optimization techniques, often lack adaptability to dynamic workloads and, more importantly, cannot simultaneously optimize multiple objectives in HPC systems. To address this, we propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based scheduler using a ReAct-style framework (Reason + Act), enabling iterative, interpretable decision-making. The system incorporates a scratchpad memory to track scheduling history and refine decisions via natural language feedback, while a constraint enforcement module ensures feasibility and safety. We evaluate our approach using OpenAI's O4-Mini and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 across seven real-world HPC workload scenarios, including heterogeneous mixes, bursty patterns, and adversarial cases etc. Comparisons against FCFS, SJF, and Google OR-Tools (on 10 to 100 jobs) reveal that LLM-based scheduling effectively balances multiple objectives while offering transparent reasoning through natural language traces. The method excels in constraint satisfaction and adapts to diverse workloads without domain-specific training. However, a trade-off between reasoning quality and computational overhead challenges real-time deployment. This work presents the first comprehensive study of reasoning-capable LLMs for HPC scheduling, demonstrating their potential to handle multiobjective optimization while highlighting limitations in computational efficiency. The findings provide insights into leveraging advanced language models for complex scheduling problems in dynamic HPC environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, work under review</p></details> |

However, such interaction data is often subject to position bias, as users are more likely to click on items that appear higher in the ranking, regardless of their actual relevance. As a result, newly trained models may inherit and reinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving relevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a propensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given position is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging, especially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts. In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating position bias using Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to logged user interaction data. This approach offers a cost-effective alternative to online experimentation. Our experiments show that propensities estimated with our LLM-as-a-judge approach are stable across score buckets and reveal the row-column effects of Viator's grid layout that simpler heuristics overlook. An IPS-weighted reranker trained with these propensities matches the production model on standard NDCG@10 while improving weighted NDCG@10 by roughly 2%. We will verify these offline gains in forthcoming live-traffic experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the CONSEQUENCES Workshop @ RecSys'25</p></details> |

With the rise of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, research in programming education has increasingly focused on automated feedback generation to help teachers provide timely support to every student. However, prior studies often overlook key pedagogical principles, such as mastery and progress adaptation, that shape effective feedback strategies. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical framework for LLM-driven feedback generation derived from established feedback models and local insights from secondary school teachers. To evaluate this framework, we implemented a web-based application for Python programming with LLM-based feedback that follows the framework and conducted a mixed-method evaluation with eight secondary-school computer science teachers. Our findings suggest that teachers consider that, when aligned with the framework, LLMs can effectively support students and even outperform human teachers in certain scenarios through instant and precise feedback. However, we also found several limitations, such as its inability to adapt feedback to dynamic classroom contexts. Such a limitation highlights the need to complement LLM-generated feedback with human expertise to ensure effective student learning. This work demonstrates an effective way to use LLMs for feedback while adhering to pedagogical standards and highlights important considerations for future systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECTEL...</summary><p>ECTEL 2025 Preprint.

These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract ``vectors of variable variations'' (e.g., ``male'' to ``female'') from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications, strengthening sociological theory and measurement.</p></details> |  |

This bias undermines fairness and reliability in evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions. This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges and motivates more robust interventions.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis reveals that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this, we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.</p></details> | Preprint |

In agentic settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives. Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

While hallucinations-unintentional falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics, shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in high-stakes environments.

Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally, these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This technical report serves as the archival version of our paper accepted at the ICCV 2025 Workshop.

To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

With over 21,000 vulnerabilities disclosed in 2025, manual analysis is infeasible, making scalable and verifiable AI support critical. When querying LLMs, dealing with emerging vulnerabilities is challenging as they have a training cut-off date. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can inject up-to-date context to alleviate the cut-off date limitation, it remains unclear how much LLMs rely on retrieved evidence versus the model's internal knowledge, and whether the retrieved information is meaningful or even correct. This uncertainty could mislead security analysts, mis-prioritize patches, and increase security risks. Therefore, this work proposes LLM Embedding-based Attribution (LEA) to analyze the generated responses for vulnerability exploitation analysis. More specifically, LEA quantifies the relative contribution of internal knowledge vs. retrieved content in the generated responses. We evaluate LEA on 500 critical vulnerabilities disclosed between 2016 and 2025, across three RAG settings -- valid, generic, and incorrect -- using three state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate LEA's ability to detect clear distinctions between non-retrieval, generic-retrieval, and valid-retrieval scenarios with over 95% accuracy on larger models. Finally, we demonstrate the limitations posed by incorrect retrieval of vulnerability information and raise a cautionary note to the cybersecurity community regarding the blind reliance on LLMs and RAG for vulnerability analysis. LEA offers security analysts with a metric to audit RAG-enhanced workflows, improving the transparent and trustworthy deployment of AI in cybersecurity threat analysis.</p></details> |  |

A common approach is an iterative generate-critique-refine loop, where candidate models are produced, evaluated, and updated based on detected issues. This process needs to address: (1) structural correctness - compliance with well-formedness rules - and (2) semantic alignment - accurate reflection of the intended meaning in the source text. We present LADEX (LLM-based Activity Diagram Extractor), a pipeline for deriving activity diagrams from natural-language process descriptions using an LLM-driven critique-refine process. Structural checks in LADEX can be performed either algorithmically or by an LLM, while alignment checks are always performed by an LLM. We design five ablated variants of LADEX to study: (i) the impact of the critique-refine loop itself, (ii) the role of LLM-based semantic checks, and (iii) the comparative effectiveness of algorithmic versus LLM-based structural checks. To evaluate LADEX, we compare the generated activity diagrams with expert-created ground truths using trace-based operational semantics. This enables automated measurement of correctness and completeness. Experiments on two datasets indicate that: (1) the critique-refine loop improves structural validity, correctness, and completeness compared to single-pass generation; (2) algorithmic structural checks eliminate inconsistencies that LLM-based checks fail to detect, improving correctness by an average of 17.81% and completeness by 13.24% over LLM-only checks; and (3) combining algorithmic structural checks with LLM-based semantic checks, implemented using the reasoning-focused O4 Mini, achieves the best overall performance - yielding average correctness of up to 86.37% and average completeness of up to 88.56% - while requiring fewer than five LLM calls on average.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on common model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

In ground-based astronomy, combining multiple exposures to enhance signal-to-noise ratios is further complicated by variations in the point-spread function caused by atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we present a self-supervised multi-frame method, based on deep image priors, for denoising, deblurring, and coadding ground-based exposures. Central to our approach is a carefully designed convolutional neural network that integrates information across multiple observations and enforces physically motivated constraints. We demonstrate the method's potential by processing Hyper Suprime-Cam exposures, yielding promising preliminary results with sharper restored images.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics.

Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

Real-world pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable, stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual staining.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV |

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Bayes image restoration with compressive autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17744v4)** | 2025-08-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2311.17744v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play (PnP) methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance as state-of-the-art PnP methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.

While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.</p></details> |  |

However, it faced challenges when it came to distinguishing between shadows and their backgrounds. To address this, we developed Deshadow-Anything, considering the generalization of large-scale datasets, and we performed Fine-tuning on large-scale datasets to achieve image shadow removal. The diffusion model can diffuse along the edges and textures of an image, helping to remove shadows while preserving the details of the image. Furthermore, we design Multi-Self-Attention Guidance (MSAG) and adaptive input perturbation (DDPM-AIP) to accelerate the iterative training speed of diffusion. Experiments on shadow removal tasks demonstrate that these methods can effectively improve image restoration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ne...</summary><p>We need to make major changes and re-upload</p></details> |

Experiments on Derain/Deshadow/Deblur task demonstrate that these methods are effective in improving restoration performance. In addition, this paper's model obtains significant PSNR, SSIM gain on three datasets with different degradation types, which is a strong proof that the recovered images are perceptually realistic.

The early face restoration methods mainly use statistical priors and degradation models, which are difficult to meet the requirements of real-world applications in practice. In recent years, face restoration has witnessed great progress after stepping into the deep learning era. However, there are few works to systematically study the deep learning based face restoration methods. Thus, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in deep learning techniques for face restoration. Specifically, we first summarize different problem formulations and analyze the characteristics of face images. Second, we discuss the challenges of face restoration. With regard to these challenges, we present a comprehensive review of recent FR methods, including prior-based methods and deep-learning methods. Then, we explore developed techniques in the task of FR covering network architectures, loss functions, and benchmark datasets. We also conduct a systematic benchmark evaluation on representative methods. Finally, we discuss the future directions including network designs, metrics, benchmark datasets, applications, etc. We also provide an open source repository for all the discussed methods, which is available at https://github.com/TaoWangzj/Awesome-Face-Restoration.</p></details> | 35 pages, 14 figures |

However, most existing methods are obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score. Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image restoration tasks.

Despite great advances in image restoration and enhancement in recent years, such systematic defects often cannot be restored by current state-of-the-art software features as available e.g. in Adobe Photoshop, but would require the incorporation of defect-aware priors into the underlying machine learning techniques. However, there are no publicly available datasets of autochromes with defect annotations. In this paper, we address these limitations and present the first approach that allows the automatic removal of greening color defects in digitized autochrome photographs. For this purpose, we introduce an approach for accurately simulating respective defects and use the respectively obtained synthesized data with its ground truth defect annotations to train a generative AI model with a carefully designed loss function that accounts for color imbalances between defected and non-defected areas. As demonstrated in our evaluation, our approach allows for the efficient and effective restoration of the considered defects, thereby overcoming limitations of alternative techniques that struggle with accurately reproducing original colors and may require significant manual effort.</p></details> |  |

We introduce NeuSee, the first computational imaging framework for high-fidelity sensor protection across the full visible spectrum. It jointly learns a neural representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. NeuSee system is adversarially trained end-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high as $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\textrm{sat}}$, the point at which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system leverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing, integrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for realistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account open-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and positions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions, and sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum imaging and laser suppression for the first time, with a 10.1\% improvement in restored image quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICCVW 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready, update Fig.4</p></details> |

However, license plate areas in dash cam images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework, MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR (RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments, MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms significantly contribute to these improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU), 2025</p></details> |

This study presents the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs), including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models, particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment. This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Degradation-Agnostic Statistical Facial Feature Transformation for Blind Face Restoration in Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07464v3)** | 2025-08-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.07464v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models, particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Underwater monitoring platforms rely on mainly visual data for marine biodiversity analysis, ecological assessment and autonomous exploration. However, underwater environments present significant challenges due to light scattering, absorption and turbidity, which degrade image clarity and distort colour information, which makes accurate observation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose DEEP-SEA, a novel deep learning-based underwater image restoration model to enhance both low- and high-frequency information while preserving spatial structures. The proposed Dual-Frequency Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial and Frequency Modulator aims to adaptively refine feature representations in frequency domains and simultaneously spatial information for better structural preservation. Our comprehensive experiments on EUVP and LSUI datasets demonstrate the superiority over the state of the art in restoring fine-grained image detail and structural consistency. By effectively mitigating underwater visual degradation, DEEP-SEA has the potential to improve the reliability of underwater monitoring platforms for more accurate ecological observation, species identification and autonomous navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, current explainable IQA methods not only inadequately use the same distortion criteria to evaluate both User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images, but also lack detailed quality analysis for monitoring image quality and guiding image restoration. In this study, we establish the first large-scale Visual Distortion Assessment Instruction Tuning Dataset for UGC images, termed ViDA-UGC, which comprises 11K images with fine-grained quality grounding, detailed quality perception, and reasoning quality description data. This dataset is constructed through a distortion-oriented pipeline, which involves human subject annotation and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assessment framework. This framework guides GPT-4o to generate quality descriptions by identifying and analyzing UGC distortions, which helps capturing rich low-level visual features that inherently correlate with distortion patterns. Moreover, we carefully select 476 images with corresponding 6,149 question answer pairs from ViDA-UGC and invite a professional team to ensure the accuracy and quality of GPT-generated information. The selected and revised data further contribute to the first UGC distortion assessment benchmark, termed ViDA-UGC-Bench. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ViDA-UGC and CoT framework for consistently enhancing various image quality analysis abilities across multiple base MLLMs on ViDA-UGC-Bench and Q-Bench, even surpassing GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose SNNSIR, a simple yet effective Spiking Neural Network for Stereo Image Restoration, specifically designed under the spike-driven paradigm where neurons transmit information through sparse, event-based binary spikes. In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on operations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are incompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed SNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and hardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of binary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic Block (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual learning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM) module introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication and highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation. Complementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further improves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature interaction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive experiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak removal, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution demonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. These results highlight the potential for real-time, low-power stereo vision applications. The code will be available after the article is accepted.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization, 1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures, leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; https://github.com/cszn/ConverseNet</p></details> |

Current image restoration methods struggle to handle complex degradation while maintaining efficiency. This paper introduces a novel image restoration architecture that combines multi-dimensional dynamic attention and self-attention within a U-Net framework. To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks.

However, a critical limitation of existing RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131 LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |

While State-Space Models like Mamba offer proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent 1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images, hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations, our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal modeling.

| **[A Survey on All-in-One Image Restoration: Taxonomy, Evaluation and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15067v3)** | 2025-08-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.15067v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) seeks to recover high-quality images from degraded observations caused by a wide range of factors, including noise, blur, compression, and adverse weather. While traditional IR methods have made notable progress by targeting individual degradation types, their specialization often comes at the cost of generalization, leaving them ill-equipped to handle the multifaceted distortions encountered in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance the convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we provide the first in-depth and systematic overview of AiOIR, delivering a structured taxonomy that categorizes existing methods by architectural designs, learning paradigms, and their core innovations. We systematically categorize current approaches and assess the challenges these models encounter, outlining research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. To facilitate the evaluation of existing methods, we also consolidate widely-used datasets, evaluation protocols, and implementation practices, and compare and summarize the most advanced open-source models. As the first comprehensive review dedicated to AiOIR, this paper aims to map the conceptual landscape, synthesize prevailing techniques, and ignite further exploration toward more intelligent, unified, and adaptable visual restoration systems.

In particular, recent advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type, resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with only 2.75M parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Sea-Undistort, a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 1200 paired 512x512 through-water scenes rendered in Blender. Each pair comprises a distortion-free and a distorted view, featuring realistic water effects such as sun glint, waves, and scattering over diverse seabeds. Accompanied by per-image metadata such as camera parameters, sun position, and average depth, Sea-Undistort enables supervised training that is otherwise infeasible in real environments. We use Sea-Undistort to benchmark two state-of-the-art image restoration methods alongside an enhanced lightweight diffusion-based framework with an early-fusion sun-glint mask. When applied to real aerial data, the enhanced diffusion model delivers more complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed, especially in deeper areas, reduces bathymetric errors, suppresses glint and scattering, and crisply restores fine seabed details.

However, existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF) scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition, the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205 high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, such as extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component, utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba, which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.</p></details> |  |

This capability has enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters, and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation.

To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model complexity and computational overhead.

However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration; differences between the original and restored images highlight potential abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans, which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities in heterogeneous cohorts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Once and Done: Degradation-Aware LoRA for Efficient All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03373v1)** | 2025-08-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.03373v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details. The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method, Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models. Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then, parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Illumination: Fine-Grained Detail Preservation in Extreme Dark Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03336v1)** | 2025-08-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.03336v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with minimal computational overhead.

With the emergence of state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels, effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while preserving semantic consistency.

However, existing methods often rely on implicitly learned priors, which may entangle feature representations and hinder performance in complex or unseen scenarios. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as a classical gradient representation, we observe that it has strong discriminative capability across diverse degradations, making it a powerful and interpretable prior for AIR. Based on this insight, we propose HOGformer, a Transformer-based model that integrates learnable HOG features for degradation-aware restoration. The core of HOGformer is a Dynamic HOG-aware Self-Attention (DHOGSA) mechanism, which adaptively models long-range spatial dependencies conditioned on degradation-specific cues encoded by HOG descriptors. To further adapt the heterogeneity of degradations in AIR, we propose a Dynamic Interaction Feed-Forward (DIFF) module that facilitates channel-spatial interactions, enabling robust feature transformation under diverse degradations. Besides, we propose a HOG loss to explicitly enhance structural fidelity and edge sharpness. Extensive experiments on a variety of benchmarks, including adverse weather and natural degradations, demonstrate that HOGformer achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes well to complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/HOGformer.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging a theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures, highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways, Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual IHC synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we introduce a Degradation-Aware Feature Fusion (DAFF) to dynamically inject low-quality features into each denoising step via decoupled fusion and adaptive modulation, enabling implicit modeling of diverse and compound degradations. Furthermore, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery through expert routing.

However, due to the inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba architecture that maintains information consistency during feature transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods while maintaining model efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, recent AiO solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions. We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV25 |

Furthermore, we propose a Residual Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.</p></details> | 21 pages |

However, they face several critical challenges: removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution. Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient and high-quality image restoration.</p></details> |  |

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate cross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references.

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025.

While significant progress has been made in state estimation methods that utilize visual data in the past decade, most evaluations have been limited to controlled indoor and urban environments, where impressive performance was demonstrated. However, these techniques have not been extensively tested in extremely challenging conditions, such as underwater scenarios where factors such as water and light conditions, robot path, and depth can greatly impact algorithm performance. Hence, our evaluation is conducted in real-world AUV scenarios as well as laboratory settings which provide precise external reference. A focus is laid on understanding the impact of environmental conditions, such as optical properties of the water and illumination scenarios, on the performance of monocular vSLAM methods. To this end, we first show that all methods perform very well in in-air settings and subsequently show the degradation of their performance in challenging underwater environments. The final goal of this study is to identify techniques that can improve accuracy and robustness of SLAM methods in such conditions. To achieve this goal, we investigate the potential of image enhancement techniques to improve the quality of input images used by the SLAM methods, specifically in low visibility and extreme lighting scenarios in scattering media. We present a first evaluation on calibration maneuvers and simple image restoration techniques to determine their ability to enable or enhance the performance of monocular SLAM methods in underwater environments.</p></details> |  |

Especially Transformer-based models, particularly those leveraging window-based self-attention, have become a dominant force in image restoration. However, their performance is fundamentally constrained by the rigid, non-overlapping window partitioning scheme, which leads to two critical limitations: insufficient feature interaction across window boundaries and content-agnostic receptive fields that cannot adapt to diverse image structures. Existing methods often rely on heuristic patterns to mitigate these issues, rather than addressing the root cause. In this paper, we propose the Deformable Sliding Window Transformer (DSwinIR), a new foundational backbone architecture that systematically overcomes these limitations. At the heart of DSwinIR is the proposed novel Deformable Sliding Window (DSwin) Attention. This mechanism introduces two fundamental innovations. First, it replaces the rigid partitioning with a token-centric sliding window paradigm, ensuring seamless cross-window information flow and effectively eliminating boundary artifacts. Second, it incorporates a content-aware deformable sampling strategy, which allows the attention mechanism to learn data-dependent offsets and dynamically shape its receptive fields to focus on the most informative image regions. This synthesis endows the model with both strong locality-aware inductive biases and powerful, adaptive long-range modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments show that DSwinIR sets a new state-of-the-art across a wide spectrum of image restoration tasks. For instance, in all-in-one restoration, our DSwinIR surpasses the most recent backbone GridFormer by over 0.53 dB on the three-task benchmark and a remarkable 0.86 dB on the five-task benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations, leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks, DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 3figures, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

While existing methods focus on detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.</p></details> |  |

We consider the setting where the rank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a priori and use an objective function built from a rank-overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground truth. We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the rank of the ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix rank, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when it is stopped appropriately. We then propose an efficient stopping strategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects a nearly optimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with deep image prior, which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 10 figures</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the theory available for the Gaussian case cannot be extended to the Poisson case, due to the non-Lipschitz gradient of the fidelity function, the Kullback-Leibler functional, or the absence of closed-form solution for the proximal operator of such term, leading to employ iterative solvers for the inner subproblem. In this work we extend the idea of PIDSplit+ algorithm, exploiting the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, to PnP scheme: this allows to provide a closed form solution for the deblurring step, with no need for iterative solvers. The convergence of the method is assured by employing a firmly non expansive denoiser. The proposed method, namely PnPSplit+, is tested on different Poisson image restoration problems, showing remarkable performance even in presence of high noise level and severe blurring conditions.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing methods focus on any one particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3) a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | Under Review |

Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance, and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models. Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors, effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration, primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for diverse low-level computer vision problems.</p></details> |  |

While some progress has been made, existing methods continue to struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural damage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging flare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference images in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this paper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that decouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain, effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists mainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local detail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive the frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing global frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from content information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning strategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference image, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves fine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance.

When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper, a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem, the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks, specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\) and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.</p></details> |  |

To address the challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible integration with various architectures and effective utilization of task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity. We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization, few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general low-level vision modeling.</p></details> |  |

Image restoration has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet). Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RS image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, also Markov properties of the high-order degradation process and Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real remote sensing images.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, Accepted to Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS), July 16, 2025</p></details> |

Although unsupervised part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors. By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover, several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios.

Although existing methods introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems, mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated. Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance, showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer quality.

Like other single deep regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB, surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced complexity.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Yet, these GAN-based approaches struggle to surpass the performance of conventional unsupervised GAN-based frameworks without significantly modifying model structures or increasing the computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for existing restoration models. This strategy utilizes information from the previous stage as feedback to guide subsequent stages, achieving significant performance improvement without increasing the framework's inference complexity. The SC strategy comprises a prompt learning (PL) module and a restorer ($Res$). It iteratively replaces the previous less powerful fixed restorer $\overline{Res}$ in the PL module with a more powerful $Res$. The enhanced PL module generates better pseudo-degraded/clean image pairs, leading to a more powerful $Res$ for the next iteration. Our SC can significantly improve the $Res$'s performance by over 1.5 dB without adding extra parameters or computational complexity during inference. Meanwhile, existing self-ensemble (SE) and our SC strategies enhance the performance of pre-trained restorers from different perspectives. As SE increases computational complexity during inference, we propose a re-boosting module to the SC (Reb-SC) to improve the SC strategy further by incorporating SE into SC without increasing inference time. This approach further enhances the restorer's performance by approximately 0.3 dB. Extensive experimental results on restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art unsupervised restoration methods.

Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks.

The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics.

Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MP-HSIR}, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

Our method trains a conditional flow model to minimize the divergence between the variational distribution and the posterior distribution implicitly defined by the diffusion model. This results in a powerful, amortized sampler capable of generating diverse posterior samples with a single neural function evaluation, generalizing across various measurements. Unlike existing methods, our approach is unsupervised, requires no paired training data, and is applicable to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of tasks, including image restoration, manifold signal reconstruction, and climate data imputation. APS significantly outperforms existing approaches in computational efficiency while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, enabling real-time, high-quality solutions to inverse problems across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

They are a critical tool in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models -- which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project website https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/.</p></details> |  |

Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals, symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revisions: fixed discussion, corrected spelling</p></details> |

Despite the success achieved by existing deep learning-based restoration methods with sophisticated modules, they struggle with rendering computationally-efficient reconstruction results. Moreover, they usually ignore the reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in medical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight Transformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency domain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer (RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling operations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple inferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM. Additionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial domain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and imaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in the design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging the conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational complexity of naive CA by nearly half. Extensive experimental results in various tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LRformer in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples, computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared, higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

These techniques are often not applicable in unconditional generation or in various downstream tasks such as image restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling guidance, called Perturbed-Attention Guidance (PAG), which improves diffusion sample quality across both unconditional and conditional settings, achieving this without requiring additional training or the integration of external modules. PAG is designed to progressively enhance the structure of samples throughout the denoising process. It involves generating intermediate samples with degraded structure by substituting selected self-attention maps in diffusion U-Net with an identity matrix, by considering the self-attention mechanisms' ability to capture structural information, and guiding the denoising process away from these degraded samples. In both ADM and Stable Diffusion, PAG surprisingly improves sample quality in conditional and even unconditional scenarios. Moreover, PAG significantly improves the baseline performance in various downstream tasks where existing guidances such as CG or CFG cannot be fully utilized, including ControlNet with empty prompts and image restoration such as inpainting and deblurring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://ku-cvlab.github.io/Perturbed-Attention-Guidance.

Building upon these achievements, diffusion models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning, these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM), a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring, and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original performance.</p></details> |  |

While T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors.

However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps.

However, SSM-based approaches exhibit limitations in reconstructing localized structures and tend to be less effective when handling high-dimensional data, frequently resulting in suboptimal recovery of fine image features. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Laplace-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Laplace frequency prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing. Leveraging the Laplace decomposition, the image is disentangled into low-frequency components capturing global texture and high-frequency components representing edges and fine details. This decomposition enables specialized processing via dual parallel pathways: the low-frequency branch employs SSMs for global context modeling, while the high-frequency branch utilizes CNNs to refine local structural details, effectively addressing diverse haze scenarios. Notably, the Laplace transformation facilitates information-preserving downsampling of low-frequency components in accordance with the Nyquist theory, thereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency.

Most of the current models handle these two challenges by applying Graph Neural Networks or known physics principles, and quantifying stochasticity through probabilistic networks like Diffusion models. Nevertheless, finding the right balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score (CRPS).</p></details> |  |

The emergence of Vision Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba (EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising, deblurring, and dehazing.

Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks, improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors, further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR. Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing general IR architectures.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space. However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results.

We analyze this phenomenon from the perspective of networks attempting to bypass constraints imposed by conventional LayerNorm due to conflicts against requirements in IR tasks. Accordingly, we address two misalignments between LayerNorm and IR tasks, and later show that addressing these mismatches leads to both stabilized training dynamics and improved IR performance. Specifically, conventional LayerNorm works in a per-token manner, disrupting spatial correlations between tokens, essential in IR tasks. Also, it employs an input-independent normalization that restricts the flexibility of feature scales, required to preserve input-specific statistics. Together, these mismatches significantly hinder IR Transformer's ability to accurately preserve low-level features throughout the network. To this end, we introduce Image Restoration Transformer Tailored Layer Normalization~(i-LN), a surprisingly simple drop-in replacement for conventional LayerNorm. We propose to normalize features in a holistic manner across the entire spatio-channel dimension, preserving spatial relationships among individual tokens. Additionally, we introduce an input-adaptive rescaling strategy that maintains the feature range flexibility required by individual inputs. Together, these modifications effectively contribute to preserving low-level feature statistics of inputs throughout IR Transformers. Experimental results verify that this combined strategy enhances both the stability and performance of IR Transformers across various IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features, conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy panoramic dental radiographs.

Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer (TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training convergence, and generalization.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by up to 12% on MSE and 6% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

While recent work has advanced the identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported, redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.</p></details> | Preprint |

To address the challenge of aligning complex garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence, where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots, cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size, allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not available.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-resolution efficient image generation from WiFi CSI using a pretrained latent diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10605v3)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.10605v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[InfoScale: Unleashing Training-free Variable-scaled Image Generation via Effective Utilization of Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01421v2)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.01421v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise. Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3) The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose \textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and achieve an effective balance between local and global information in higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3), we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image generation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often collapse multi-modality, struggle with long-horizon consistency, or lack modular adaptability. This paper presents KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion component generates temporally coherent and multi-modal action sequences, while the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://perfectxu88.github.io/KDP-AD/</p></details> |

This process generates removal resistance depending on such process conditions as material type, removal volume, and robot grinding posture, all of which complicate the analytical modeling of shape transitions. Additionally, a data-driven approach based on real-world data is challenging due to high data collection costs and the irreversible nature of the process. This paper proposes a Cutting Sequence Diffuser (CSD) for object shaping by grinding. The CSD, which only requires simple simulation data for model learning, offers an efficient way to plan long-horizon action sequences transferable to the real world. Our method designs a smooth action space with constrained small removal volumes to suppress the complexity of the shape transitions caused by removal resistance, thus reducing the reality gap in simulations. Moreover, by using a diffusion model to generate long-horizon action sequences, our approach reduces the planning time and allows for grinding the target shape while adhering to the constraints of a small removal volume per step. Through evaluations in both simulation and real robot experiments, we confirmed that our CSD was effective for grinding to different materials and various target shapes in a short time.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Accepted by Robotics and Automation Letter</p></details> |
| **[Generating Synthetic Contrast-Enhanced Chest CT Images from Non-Contrast Scans Using Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16897v2)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.16897v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for diagnosing and monitoring thoracic diseases, including aortic pathologies. However, contrast agents pose risks such as nephrotoxicity and allergic-like reactions. The ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA) images without contrast administration would be transformative, enhancing patient safety and accessibility while reducing healthcare costs. In this study, we propose the first bridge diffusion-based solution for synthesizing contrast-enhanced CTA images from non-contrast CT scans. Our approach builds on the Slice-Consistent Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SC-BBDM), leveraging its ability to model complex mappings while maintaining consistency across slices. Unlike conventional slice-wise synthesis methods, our framework preserves full 3D anatomical integrity while operating in a high-resolution 2D fashion, allowing seamless volumetric interpretation under a low memory budget. To ensure robust spatial alignment, we implement a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline that includes resampling, registration using the Symmetric Normalization method, and a sophisticated dilated segmentation mask to extract the aorta and surrounding structures. We create two datasets from the Coltea-Lung dataset: one containing only the aorta and another including both the aorta and heart, enabling a detailed analysis of anatomical context. We compare our approach against baseline methods on both datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving vascular structures while enhancing contrast fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[STADI: Fine-Grained Step-Patch Diffusion Parallelism for Heterogeneous GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04719v1)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.04719v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The escalating adoption of diffusion models for applications such as image generation demands efficient parallel inference techniques to manage their substantial computational cost. However, existing diffusion parallelism inference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause workload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Inference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in such settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained parallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI introduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup phases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to reduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further minimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism mechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to their computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through a complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both load-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy, demonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance bottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion inference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference latency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on heterogeneous GPUs.</p></details> |  |

We focus on an offline setting where the agent has only a fixed dataset -- common in realistic tasks to prevent unsafe exploration. To address this, we propose Diffusion-Regularized Constrained Offline Reinforcement Learning (DRCORL), which first uses a diffusion model to capture the behavioral policy from offline data and then extracts a simplified policy to enable efficient inference. We further apply gradient manipulation for safety adaptation, balancing the reward objective and constraint satisfaction. This approach leverages high-quality offline data while incorporating safety requirements. Empirical results show that DRCORL achieves reliable safety performance, fast inference, and strong reward outcomes across robot learning tasks. Compared to existing safe offline RL methods, it consistently meets cost limits and performs well with the same hyperparameters, indicating practical applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597v1)** | 2025-09-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.04597v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective, generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection. Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches, DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data. A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks. Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.</p></details> |  |

However, as their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story visualizations at various levels of detail.</p></details> |  |

To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyunsoocha.github.io/durian</p></details> |

Motion artifacts in brain MRI, mainly from rigid head motion, degrade image quality and hinder downstream applications. Conventional methods to mitigate these artifacts, including repeated acquisitions or motion tracking, impose workflow burdens. This study introduces Res-MoCoDiff, an efficient denoising diffusion probabilistic model specifically designed for MRI motion artifact correction.Approach.Res-MoCoDiff exploits a novel residual error shifting mechanism during the forward diffusion process to incorporate information from motion-corrupted images. This mechanism allows the model to simulate the evolution of noise with a probability distribution closely matching that of the corrupted data, enabling a reverse diffusion process that requires only four steps. The model employs a U-net backbone, with attention layers replaced by Swin Transformer blocks, to enhance robustness across resolutions. Furthermore, the training process integrates a combined l1+l2 loss function, which promotes image sharpness and reduces pixel-level errors. Res-MoCoDiff was evaluated on both an in-silico dataset generated using a realistic motion simulation framework and an in-vivo MR-ART dataset. Comparative analyses were conducted against established methods, including CycleGAN, Pix2pix, and a diffusion model with a vision transformer backbone, using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE.Main results. The proposed method demonstrated superior performance in removing motion artifacts across minor, moderate, and heavy distortion levels. Res-MoCoDiff consistently achieved the highest SSIM and the lowest NMSE values, with a PSNR of up to 41.91+-2.94 dB for minor distortions. Notably, the average sampling time was reduced to 0.37 seconds per batch of two image slices, compared with 101.74 seconds for conventional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-step Flow for 3D Generation via Marginal-Data Transport Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04406v1)** | 2025-09-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.04406v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex 3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective: distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD), to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD) further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s (2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/Zanue/MDT-dist</p></details> |

Previous methods have achieved success in generating diverse digital avatars, however, generating avatars with disentangled components (\eg, body, hair, and clothes) has long been a challenge. In this paper, we propose LayerAvatar, the first feed-forward diffusion-based method for generating component-disentangled clothed avatars. To achieve this, we first propose a layered UV feature plane representation, where components are distributed in different layers of the Gaussian-based UV feature plane with corresponding semantic labels. This representation supports high-resolution and real-time rendering, as well as expressive animation including controllable gestures and facial expressions. Based on the well-designed representation, we train a single-stage diffusion model and introduce constrain terms to address the severe occlusion problem of the innermost human body layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive performances of our method in generating disentangled clothed avatars, and we further explore its applications in component transfer.

This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators, TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is released at https://github.com/WZDTHU/TiM</p></details> |

However, these models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships. This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models. Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new, high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this direction.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[SSGaussian: Semantic-Aware and Structure-Preserving 3D Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04379v1)** | 2025-09-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.04379v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto 3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image. Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First, we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints. Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree environments.

However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis, leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217 measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences</p></details> |

However, existing methods use either multi-round training or knowledge within minibatches, posing challenges in finding a favorable coupling strategy for straightening trajectories to few-step generation. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, Straighter trajectories of Flow Matching (StraightFM). It straightens trajectories with the coupling strategy from the entire distribution level. More specifically, during training, StraightFM creates couplings of images and noise via one diffusion model as a coupling prior to straighten trajectories for few-step generation. Our coupling strategy can also integrate with the existing coupling direction from real data to noise, improving image quality in few-step generation. Experimental results on pixel space and latent space show that StraightFM yields attractive samples within 5 steps. Moreover, our unconditional StraightFM is seamlessly compatible with training-free multimodal conditional generation, maintaining high-quality image generation in few steps.</p></details> |  |

Prior generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of dexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in partial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We propose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse, robust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty in the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based deep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that prioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and success rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its practical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven sampling excels by mitigating collisions (Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/ffhflow/home/).</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally, whose ordering decided via coin-tossing.

Multi-Conditioning for Image Generation via Sketch-Text Pairing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22627v2)** | 2025-09-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.22627v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material, texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a global description with paired localized sketch + text information for conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its unprecedented level of design customization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV25 (Oral).

Recent advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars. However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand, generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale, cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas. During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models with the same backbone in both image quality and style diversity.</p></details> |  |

As a multi-task learning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting specific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration of these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts and dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To address the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a two-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting player and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to maximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end, inspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to guide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU guarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state would lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring optimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a diverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation. Extensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting and preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting precision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |

The goal of this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control, limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than ``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i) human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion. Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized motion generation.</p></details> |  |

Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness.

Traditional methods, involving simple transformations such as rotations and flips, create new images but often lack diversity along key semantic dimensions and fail to alter high-level semantic properties. To address this issue, generative models have emerged as an effective solution for augmenting data by generating synthetic images. Controllable Generative models offer data augmentation methods for semantic segmentation tasks by using prompts and visual references from the original image. However, these models face challenges in generating synthetic images that accurately reflect the content and structure of the original image due to difficulties in creating effective prompts and visual references. In this work, we introduce an effective data augmentation pipeline for semantic segmentation using Controllable Diffusion model. Our proposed method includes efficient prompt generation using Class-Prompt Appending and Visual Prior Blending to enhance attention to labeled classes in real images, allowing the pipeline to generate a precise number of augmented images while preserving the structure of segmentation-labeled classes. In addition, we implement a class balancing algorithm to ensure a balanced training dataset when merging the synthetic and original images. Evaluation on PASCAL VOC datasets, our pipeline demonstrates its effectiveness in generating high-quality synthetic images for semantic segmentation.

In such settings, traditional positioning techniques relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM. Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost, offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS emitter localization.</p></details> |  |

Existing language models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces $\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial music generation platforms.

The analysis begins with foundational architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks. Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new paradigm by applying the Transformer architecture to sequences of image patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale image recognition. Building on these visual representation backbones, we investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher, yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective method for pre-training large-scale vision models.</p></details> |  |

Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving IPs, achieving remarkable reconstruction performance. However, existing DM-based methods frequently encounter issues such as heavy computational demands and suboptimal convergence. In this work, building upon the idea of the recent work DMPlug, we propose two novel methods, DMILO and DMILO-PGD, to address these challenges. Our first method, DMILO, employs intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to alleviate the memory burden inherent in DMPlug. Additionally, by introducing sparse deviations, we expand the range of DMs, enabling the exploration of underlying signals that may lie outside the range of the diffusion model. We further propose DMILO-PGD, which integrates ILO with projected gradient descent (PGD), thereby reducing the risk of suboptimal convergence. We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our approaches under appropriate conditions and validate their superiority through extensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and nonlinear IPs.

However, each architecture presents specific challenges while realizing them on-device. Vision Transformers require positional embedding to maintain correspondence between the tokens processed by the transformer, although they offer the advantage of using fixed-size, reusable repetitive blocks following tokenization. The U-Net architecture lacks these attributes, as it utilizes variable-sized intermediate blocks for down-convolution and up-convolution in the noise estimation backbone for the diffusion process. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that utilizes a fixed-size, reusable transformer block as a core structure, making it more suitable for hardware implementation. Our architecture is characterized by low complexity, token-free design, absence of positional embeddings, uniformity, and scalability, making it highly suitable for deployment on mobile and resource-constrained devices.

Under suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space dimension.

However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise.

However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on fine-grained datasets.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Accepted |

In this work, we propose a simple and effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over 2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which contributes to faster convergence.</p></details> | ICCV25 Workshop |

In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.</p></details> |  |

We further improve lighting transfer through a learned adaptor (MLP) that injects the target's latent extrinsic properties via cross-attention and fine-tuning. Unlike traditional ControlNet, which generates images with conditional maps from a single scene, LumiNet processes latent representations from two different images - preserving geometry and albedo from the source while transferring lighting characteristics from the target.

However, they struggle to accurately represent sequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential dependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking multiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs cannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be filled in is not known in advance. In this work, we introduce Insertion Language Models (ILMs), which learn to insert tokens at arbitrary positions in a sequence -- that is, they select jointly both the position and the vocabulary element to be inserted. By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent strong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in arbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token dependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs, we propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising objective. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that ILMs outperform both ARMs and MDMs on common planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that ILMs outperform MDMs and perform on par with ARMs in an unconditional text generation task while offering greater flexibility than MDMs in arbitrary-length text infilling.

While both can be trained under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality, remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.</p></details> |  |

Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images. However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting, are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry assets.

However, access to only the denoising kernels is often insufficient. In many applications, we need the knowledge of the marginal densities along the generation trajectory, which enables tasks such as inference-time control. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce the Radon-Nikodym Estimator (RNE). Based on the concept of the density ratio between path distributions, it reveals a fundamental connection between marginal densities and transition kernels, providing a flexible plug-and-play framework that unifies diffusion density estimation, inference-time control, and energy-based diffusion training under a single perspective. Experiments demonstrated that RNE delivers strong results in inference-time control applications, such as annealing and model composition, with promising inference-time scaling performance. Moreover, RNE provides a simple yet efficient regularisation for training energy-based diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages; 15 figures; Add more experiments on energy-based training, fix several typos and an error in RNC-TDS paragraph</p></details> |

However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025 Deep-Breath Workshop.

This perspective paper provides an integrated perspective on generative diffusion by connecting their dynamic, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic properties under a unified mathematical framework. We demonstrate that the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the generative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the score function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the branching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis offers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by the controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks in information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible outcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates the bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible with the data.</p></details> |  |

Testing 180 fine-tuning tasks across models from 70M to 70B parameters, we found that HuggingFace AutoTrain, TogetherAI, Databricks, and Google Cloud consistently produce suboptimal configurations. Gradients, built on the Bittensor network, attacks this problem through competition. Independent miners race to find optimal hyperparameters, earning rewards proportional to their models' performance. This tournament drives exploration of configuration spaces that single-strategy methods never examine. In our experiments, Gradients achieved a 100\% win rate against TogetherAI, Databricks, and Google Cloud, and beat HuggingFace AutoTrain in 82.8\% of experiments. Mean improvements reached 42.1\% against commercial platforms. Retrieval-augmented generation tasks saw 30-40\% gains; diffusion models improved 23.4\% on person-specific generation. When miners compete for rewards, they develop optimization strategies that centralized approaches overlook. These findings demonstrate that decentralized systems with economic incentives can systematically outperform traditional AutoML, suggesting market dynamics may be key to achieving superior fine-tuning results.

However, leveraging such models in a Plug & Play (PnP), zero-shot manner remains challenging because it requires identifying a suitable text prompt for the unknown image of interest. Also, existing text-to-image PnP approaches are highly computationally expensive. We herein address these challenges by proposing a novel PnP inference paradigm specifically designed for embedding generative models within stochastic inverse solvers, with special attention to Latent Consistency Models (LCMs), which distill LDMs into fast generators. We leverage our framework to propose LAtent consisTency INverse sOlver (LATINO), the first zero-shot PnP framework to solve inverse problems with priors encoded by LCMs. Our conditioning mechanism avoids automatic differentiation and reaches SOTA quality in as little as 8 neural function evaluations. As a result, LATINO delivers remarkably accurate solutions and is significantly more memory and computationally efficient than previous approaches. We then embed LATINO within an empirical Bayesian framework that automatically calibrates the text prompt from the observed measurements by marginal maximum likelihood estimation. Extensive experiments show that prompt self-calibration greatly improves estimation, allowing LATINO with PRompt Optimization to define new SOTAs in image reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.

However, current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures, thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline (backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications, this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

In addition, traditional static condition control makes it difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network, demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets.

In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning attacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for DMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for visualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify and experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across timesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias and inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we observe that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept regions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these insights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism comprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency poison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid adversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning methods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all poisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published defenses.

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

While conditional generation has been widely explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing approach.</p></details> | update affiliation |

While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g., camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data. We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively. Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate 3D radar perception.</p></details> |  |

However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models. Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves StegaStamp by 18.743%.

Recent studies have utilized the integration of Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel, training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves. Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows, enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of +4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent categories.</p></details> |  |

By employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), our approach ensures consensus between data fidelity and artifact removal subproblems, maintaining physics consistency while enhancing image quality. Artifact removal is achieved using a text-guided diffusion image editing method (LEDITS++) with a pre-trained foundational diffusion model, allowing users to specify artifacts for removal in natural language. Demonstrations on simulated and experimental datasets show significant improvements in artifact suppression and structural fidelity, validated by metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and diffraction pattern consistency. This work highlights the combination of text-guided generative models and model-based phase retrieval algorithms as a transferable and fidelity-preserving method for high-quality diffraction imaging.</p></details> |  |

Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space. TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human representation.

Relying on ordinary differential equations, it offers a simple and flexible alternative to diffusion models, which are currently the state-of-the-art. Despite its empirical success, the mathematical understanding of its statistical power so far is very limited. This is largely due to the sensitivity of theoretical bounds to the Lipschitz constant of the vector field which drives the ODE. In this work, we study the assumptions that lead to controlling this dependency. Based on these results, we derive a convergence rate for the Wasserstein $1$ distance between the estimated distribution and the target distribution which improves previous results in high dimensional setting. This rate applies to certain classes of unbounded distributions and particularly does not require $\log$-concavity.</p></details> |  |

However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends. Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and expand their applicability.</p></details> |  |

When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to 0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is at https://learn-to-steer-paper.github.io/</p></details> |

The scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the size and variability of training data. However, the potential of diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion; including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at AVSS 2025 conference</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose GeoLayer, a geo-distributed graph storage framework that jointly optimizes graph replica placement and pattern request routing. We first construct a latency-aware layered graph architecture that decomposes the graph topology into multiple layers, aiming to reduce the decision space and computational complexity of the optimization problem, while mitigating the impact of network heterogeneity in geo-distributed environments. Building on the layered graph, we introduce an overlap-centric replica placement scheme to accommodate the diversity of graph pattern accesses, along with a directed heat diffusion model that captures heat conduction and superposition effects to guide data allocation. For request routing, we develop a stepwise layered routing strategy that performs progressive expansion over the layered graph to efficiently retrieve the required data. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art replica placement and routing schemes, GeoLayer achieves a 1.34x - 3.67x improvement in response times for online graph pattern requests and a 1.28x - 3.56x speedup in offline graph analysis performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-Centric Approach to Pedestrian Attribute Recognition: Synthetic Augmentation via Prompt-driven Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02099v1)** | 2025-09-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.02099v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data. Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model, presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of attributes of pedestrians in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Acepted at AVSS 2025 conference.

Their ability to generate high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically, we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale $\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |

Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. Time reversal is achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate, which can be readily implemented in simulations and experiments to generate new synthetic data samples driven by active fluctuations. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential, which opens up new avenues to exploit fluctuations in active and living systems for generative AI purposes.</p></details> |  |

While palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows, they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters: histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette adherence and high image quality.</p></details> | 14 pages, 19 figures |

In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures. However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge, our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be available at: https://github.com/wengzp1/GARLSR.</p></details> |  |

This issue is critical in the medical domain, where text-conditioned generated medical images could enable insurance fraud or falsified records, highlighting the urgent need for reliable safeguards against unethical use. While watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution in general image domains, their direct application to medical imaging presents significant challenges. A key challenge is preserving fine-grained disease manifestations, as even minor distortions from a watermark may lead to clinical misinterpretation, which compromises diagnostic integrity. To overcome this gap, we present MedSign, a deep learning-based watermarking framework specifically designed for text-to-medical image synthesis, which preserves pathologically significant regions by adaptively adjusting watermark strength. Specifically, we generate a pathology localization map using cross-attention between medical text tokens and the diffusion denoising network, aggregating token-wise attention across layers, heads, and time steps. Leveraging this map, we optimize the LDM decoder to incorporate watermarking during image synthesis, ensuring cohesive integration while minimizing interference in diagnostically critical regions. Experimental results show that our MedSign preserves diagnostic integrity while ensuring watermark robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image quality and detection accuracy on MIMIC-CXR and OIA-ODIR datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, current models that predict spatially resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion, with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space. Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of its isolated components.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures.

Most approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach, effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge, enabling practical and general relighting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yoterel.github.io/PractiLight-project-page/</p></details> |

Often, there is a need to target specific regions of the data distribution. Current guidance methods aim to sample from a distribution with mass proportional to $p_0(x_0) p(\zeta|x_0)^\alpha$ but fail to achieve this in practice. We introduce a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that generates unbiasedly from this target distribution, utilising the learnt unconditional and guided process. We validate our approach on low-dimensional distributions, controlled images and text generations. For text generation, our method provides strong control while maintaining low perplexity compared to guidance-based approaches.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |

In fact, if these models were perfectly minimizing their training loss, they would just generate data belonging to their training set, i.e., memorize, as empirically found in the overparameterized regime. We revisit this view by showing that, in highly overparameterized diffusion models, generalization in natural data domains is progressively achieved during training before the onset of memorization. Our results, ranging from image to language diffusion models, systematically support the empirical law that memorization time is proportional to the dataset size. Generalization vs. memorization is then best understood as a competition between time scales. We show that this phenomenology is recovered in diffusion models learning a simple probabilistic context-free grammar with random rules, where generalization corresponds to the hierarchical acquisition of deeper grammar rules as training time grows, and the generalization cost of early stopping can be characterized. We summarize these results in a phase diagram. Overall, our results support that a principled early-stopping criterion - scaling with dataset size - can effectively optimize generalization while avoiding memorization, with direct implications for hyperparameter transfer and privacy-sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |

To address the ill-posedness of LACT reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical imaging frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the standard diffusion model that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme. Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression. Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was previously reported.</p></details> |  |

For instance, Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a 2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss, which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration. Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16 4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.</p></details> |  |

DOI: 10.1016/j.cageo.2025.106038. Readers should refer to the published version for the most up-to-date content. Three-dimensional digital reconstruction of porous media presents a fundamental challenge in geoscience, requiring simultaneous resolution of fine-scale pore structures while capturing representative elementary volumes. We introduce a computational framework that addresses this challenge through latent diffusion models operating within the EDM framework. Our approach reduces dimensionality via a custom variational autoencoder trained in binary geological volumes, improving efficiency and also enabling the generation of larger volumes than previously possible with diffusion models. A key innovation is our controlled unconditional sampling methodology, which enhances distribution coverage by first sampling target statistics from their empirical distributions, then generating samples conditioned on these values. Extensive testing on four distinct rock types demonstrates that conditioning on porosity - a readily computable statistic - is sufficient to ensure a consistent representation of multiple complex properties, including permeability, two-point correlation functions, and pore size distributions. The framework achieves better generation quality than pixel-space diffusion while enabling significantly larger volume reconstruction (256-cube voxels) with substantially reduced computational requirements, establishing a new state-of-the-art for digital rock physics applications.</p></details> | 58 pages |

However, the success and safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443 and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally, HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve the treatment precision in current clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

While steering approaches like gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time, Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways connecting reactants and products.

This approach enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling, suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized models.</p></details> |  |

Our latent-semantic diffusion approach learns to generate coherent image-feature pairs from pure noise, significantly enhancing both generative quality and training efficiency, all while requiring only minimal modifications to standard Diffusion Transformer architectures. By eliminating the need for complex distillation objectives, our unified design simplifies training and unlocks a powerful new inference strategy: Representation Guidance, which leverages learned semantics to steer and refine image generation.

However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics, and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</p></details> |  |

This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error. Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

While fine-tuning large pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a 1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025 Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and strong generality.

World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks. For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting, our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving heterogeneous biomedical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |

A general scenario is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using a simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness of agents, our findings first indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions. Furthermore, we implement an adversarial environment injection and analyze the approach to improve faithfulness, calling for a collective focus on this important topic.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

AnyGPT can be trained stably without any alterations to the current large language model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of new languages. We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language model. Demos are shown in https://junzhan2000.github.io/AnyGPT.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, under review, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[REMOTE: A Unified Multimodal Relation Extraction Framework with Multilevel Optimal Transport and Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04844v1)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.04844v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal relation extraction (MRE) is a crucial task in the fields of Knowledge Graph and Multimedia, playing a pivotal role in multimodal knowledge graph construction. However, existing methods are typically limited to extracting a single type of relational triplet, which restricts their ability to extract triplets beyond the specified types. Directly combining these methods fails to capture dynamic cross-modal interactions and introduces significant computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a novel \textit{unified multimodal Relation Extraction framework with Multilevel Optimal Transport and mixture-of-Experts}, termed REMOTE, which can simultaneously extract intra-modal and inter-modal relations between textual entities and visual objects. To dynamically select optimal interaction features for different types of relational triplets, we introduce mixture-of-experts mechanism, ensuring the most relevant modality information is utilized. Additionally, considering that the inherent property of multilayer sequential encoding in existing encoders often leads to the loss of low-level information, we adopt a multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level features while maintaining multilayer encoding, yielding more expressive representations. Correspondingly, we also create a Unified Multimodal Relation Extraction (UMRE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, encompassing diverse cases where the head and tail entities can originate from either text or image. Extensive experiments show that REMOTE effectively extracts various types of relational triplets and achieves state-of-the-art performanc on almost all metrics across two other public MRE datasets. We release our resources at https://github.com/Nikol-coder/REMOTE.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |

While cognitive-behavioral fixation has been extensively studied in psychology, methods for computationally detecting and evaluating such fixation remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for assessing cognitive-behavioral fixation by analyzing users' multimodal social media engagement patterns. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal topic extraction module and a cognitive-behavioral fixation quantification module that collaboratively enable adaptive, hierarchical, and interpretable assessment of user behavior. Experiments on existing benchmarks and a newly curated multimodal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, laying the groundwork for scalable computational analysis of cognitive fixation. All code in this project is publicly available for research purposes at https://github.com/Liskie/cognitive-fixation-evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balanced Multimodal Learning: An Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02281v3)** | 2025-09-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.02281v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from each modality and the inter-modality interaction information. Existing strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme. UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore, the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance improvement in multimodal learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either do not take advantage of recent developments in multimodal Large Language Models (LLM) or do not consider challenges in localization uncertainty, which is critical in embodied agents. We propose employing multimodal LLMs for long-horizon planning in conjunction with detailed motion planning using our information-based objective. By leveraging high-quality view synthesis from our 3DGS representation, our method employs a multimodal LLM as a zero-shot planner for long-horizon exploration goals from the semantic perspective. We also introduce an uncertainty-aware path proposal and selection algorithm that balances the dual objectives of maximizing the information gain for the environment while minimizing the cost of localization errors. Experiments conducted on the Gibson and Habitat-Matterport 3D datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results of the proposed method.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Traditional interest modeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text labels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a complex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest modeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual descriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using cross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user interest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature embedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences to model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and accuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive evaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing our approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction accuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation click-through rates. Moreover, we incorporate interpretability mechanisms using attention weights and feature visualization to reveal the model's decision basis under multimodal inputs and trace interest shifts, thereby enhancing the transparency and controllability of the recommendation system.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Surformer v2, an enhanced multi-modal classification architecture designed to integrate visual and tactile sensory streams through a late(decision level) fusion mechanism. Building on our earlier Surformer v1 framework [1], which employed handcrafted feature extraction followed by mid-level fusion architecture with multi-head cross-attention layers, Surformer v2 integrates the feature extraction process within the model itself and shifts to late fusion. The vision branch leverages a CNN-based classifier(Efficient V-Net), while the tactile branch employs an encoder-only transformer model, allowing each modality to extract modality-specific features optimized for classification. Rather than merging feature maps, the model performs decision-level fusion by combining the output logits using a learnable weighted sum, enabling adaptive emphasis on each modality depending on data context and training dynamics. We evaluate Surformer v2 on the Touch and Go dataset [2], a multi-modal benchmark comprising surface images and corresponding tactile sensor readings. Our results demonstrate that Surformer v2 performs well, maintaining competitive inference speed, suitable for real-time robotic applications. These findings underscore the effectiveness of decision-level fusion and transformer-based tactile modeling for enhancing surface understanding in multi-modal robotic perception.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Linguistic research has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch, speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition, charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather than a text-based challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing</p></details> |

We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows.

This paper introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally, we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-oriented pipeline.

However, many prominent open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as Skywork UniPic 2.0.</p></details> |  |

The proposed TIMGen (Temporal Interest-driven Multimodal Generation) model addresses this challenge by modeling the long-term temporal evolution of users' interests and capturing dynamic interest representations with strong temporal dependencies. This model also supports the fusion of multimodal features, such as text, images, video, and audio, and delivers customized content based on multimodal preferences. TIMGen jointly learns temporal dependencies and modal preferences to obtain a unified interest representation, which it then generates to meet users' personalized content needs. TIMGen overcomes the shortcomings of personalized content recommendation methods based on static preferences, enabling flexible and dynamic modeling of users' multimodal interests, better understanding and capturing their interests and preferences. It can be extended to a variety of practical application scenarios, including e-commerce, advertising, online education, and precision medicine, providing insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

We present OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15 objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic alignment with natural hand motion.</p></details> |  |

MuMTAffect integrates multiple physiological modalities pupil dilation, eye gaze, facial action units, and galvanic skin response using dedicated, transformer-based encoders for each modality and a fusion transformer to model cross-modal interactions. Inspired by the Theory of Constructed Emotion, the architecture explicitly separates core affect encoding (valence/arousal) from higher-level conceptualization, thereby grounding predictions in contemporary affective neuroscience. Personality trait prediction is leveraged as an auxiliary task to generate robust, user-specific affective embeddings, significantly enhancing emotion recognition performance. We evaluate MuMTAffect on the AFFEC dataset, demonstrating that stimulus-level emotional cues (Stim Emo) and galvanic skin response substantially improve arousal classification, while pupil and gaze data enhance valence discrimination. The inherent modularity of MuMTAffect allows effortless integration of additional modalities, ensuring scalability and adaptability. Extensive experiments and ablation studies underscore the efficacy of our multimodal multitask approach in creating personalized, context-aware affective computing systems, highlighting pathways for further advancements in cross-subject generalisation.</p></details> |  |

However, current general-purpose music representation models, predominantly trained on large-scale datasets, often struggle to captures subtle semantic distinctions within homogeneous solo piano music. Furthermore, existing piano-specific representation models are typically unimodal, failing to capture the inherently multimodal nature of piano music, expressed through audio, symbolic, and textual modalities. To address these limitations, we propose PianoBind, a piano-specific multimodal joint embedding model. We systematically investigate strategies for multi-source training and modality utilization within a joint embedding framework optimized for capturing fine-grained semantic distinctions in (1) small-scale and (2) homogeneous piano datasets.

This study presents COBRA (Chronic Obesity Behavioral Recognition Architecture), a novel deep learning framework for objective behavioral monitoring using wrist-worn multimodal sensors. COBRA integrates a hybrid D-Net architecture combining U-Net spatial modeling, multi-head self-attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM temporal processing to classify daily activities into four obesity-relevant categories: Food Intake, Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Daily Living. Validated on the WISDM-Smart dataset with 51 subjects performing 18 activities, COBRA's optimal preprocessing strategy combines spectral-temporal feature extraction, achieving high performance across multiple architectures. D-Net demonstrates 96.86% overall accuracy with category-specific F1-scores of 98.55% (Physical Activity), 95.53% (Food Intake), 94.63% (Sedentary Behavior), and 98.68% (Daily Living), outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 1.18% in accuracy. The framework shows robust generalizability with low demographic variance (<3%), enabling scalable deployment for personalized obesity interventions and continuous lifestyle monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures. *Correspondence: m.shi16@imperial.ac.uk.

However, persistent challenges in perceptual and reasoning errors limit their efficacy, particularly in interpreting intricate visual data and deducing multimodal relationships. To address these issues, we introduce PIN (Paired and INterleaved multimodal documents), a novel data format designed to foster a deeper integration of visual and textual knowledge. The PIN format uniquely combines semantically rich Markdown files, which preserve fine-grained textual structures, with holistic overall images that capture the complete document layout. Following this format, we construct and release two large-scale, open-source datasets: PIN-200M (~200 million documents) and PIN-14M (~14 million), compiled from diverse web and scientific sources in both English and Chinese. To maximize usability, we provide detailed statistical analyses and equip the datasets with quality signals, enabling researchers to easily filter and select data for specific tasks. Our work provides the community with a versatile data format and substantial resources, offering a foundation for new research in pre-training strategies and the development of more powerful knowledge-intensive LMMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report v1.0</p></details> |

Unlike bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by PRCV2025</p></details> |

We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models. This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types, spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks: MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust and fair model evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal RSCD.

The increasing availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios. Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS) classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions, confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

As a result, established platforms in other domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.</p></details> |  |

Hence, developing new cognitive tests based on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming, and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs, guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional limitations.</p></details> | Preprint |

We propose Robult, a scalable framework designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled (PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2) a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at IJCAI 2025 in Montreal, Canada</p></details> |

Social media offers real-time updates, but extracting relevant insights remains a challenge. In this work, we focus on multimodal wildfire social media data, which, although existing in current datasets, is currently underrepresented in Canadian contexts. We present WildFireCan-MMD, a new multimodal dataset of X posts from recent Canadian wildfires, annotated across twelve key themes. We evaluate zero-shot vision-language models on this dataset and compare their results with those of custom-trained and baseline classifiers. We show that while baseline methods and zero-shot prompting offer quick deployment, custom-trained models outperform them when labelled data is available. Our best-performing custom model reaches 84.48% f-score, outperforming VLMs and baseline classifiers. We also demonstrate how this model can be used to uncover trends during wildfires, through the collection and analysis of a large unlabeled dataset. Our dataset facilitates future research in wildfire response, and our findings highlight the importance of tailored datasets and task-specific training. Importantly, such datasets should be localized, as disaster response requirements vary across regions and contexts.</p></details> |  |

Achieving aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically, based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text, M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Specifically, we introduce text modality to enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content. With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB) strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by 2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, the modalities available in clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records, and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities, making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, most fMRI datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation, connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve.

This paradigm has recently been extended to federated learning settings (e.g., PromptFL), where clients collaboratively train prompts under data privacy constraints. However, the security implications of prompt-based aggregation in federated multimodal learning remain largely unexplored, leaving a critical attack surface unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BadPromptFL}, the first backdoor attack targeting prompt-based federated learning in multimodal contrastive models. In BadPromptFL, compromised clients jointly optimize local backdoor triggers and prompt embeddings, injecting poisoned prompts into the global aggregation process. These prompts are then propagated to benign clients, enabling universal backdoor activation at inference without modifying model parameters. Leveraging the contextual learning behavior of CLIP-style architectures, BadPromptFL achieves high attack success rates (e.g., \(>90\%\)) with minimal visibility and limited client participation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and aggregation protocols validate the effectiveness, stealth, and generalizability of our attack, raising critical concerns about the robustness of prompt-based federated learning in real-world deployments.</p></details> |  |

For such studies, fundamental tasks include identifying and classifying galaxies in astronomical images, as well as retrieving visually or structurally similar galaxies through similarity search. Existing methods either directly train domain-specific foundation models on large, annotated datasets or fine-tune vision foundation models on a smaller set of images. The former is effective but costly, while the latter is more resource-efficient but often yields lower accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce GalaxAlign, a multimodal approach inspired by how citizen scientists identify galaxies in astronomical images by following textual descriptions and matching schematic symbols. Specifically, GalaxAlign employs a tri-modal alignment framework to align three types of data during fine-tuning: (1) schematic symbols representing galaxy shapes and structures, (2) textual labels for these symbols, and (3) galaxy images. By incorporating multimodal instructions, GalaxAlign eliminates the need for expensive pretraining and enhances the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Experiments on galaxy classification and similarity search demonstrate that our method effectively fine-tunes general pre-trained models for astronomical tasks by incorporating domain-specific multi-modal knowledge.

The former reflects an over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video scenarios.

For example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process. Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals, using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone. Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging.

The dataset includes 1123 FDG-PET/CT studies from patients with histologically confirmed head and neck cancer, acquired from 10 international medical centers. All examinations consisted of co-registered PET/CT scans with varying acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical diversity across institutions. Primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and involved lymph nodes (GTVn) were manually segmented by experienced radiation oncologists and radiologists following standardized guidelines and quality control measures. We provide anonymized NifTi files of all studies, along with expert-annotated segmentation masks, radiotherapy dose distribution for a subset of patients, and comprehensive clinical metadata. This metadata includes TNM staging, HPV status, demographics (age and gender), long-term follow-up outcomes, survival times, censoring indicators, and treatment information. We demonstrate how this dataset can be used for three key clinical tasks: automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV status classification, providing benchmark results using state-of-the-art deep learning models, including UNet, SegResNet, and multimodal prognostic frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

The digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially among older workers. With rising emphasis on robotics, automation, AI, and security, re-skilling and up-skilling are essential. Generative AI can help build this workforce by acting as an instructional assistant to support skill acquisition during experiential learning. We present a generative AI instructional assistant integrated into a prior experiential learning platform. The assistant employs a zero-shot OCR-LLM pipeline within the legacy Cybersecurity Labs-as-a-Service (CLaaS) platform (2015). Text is extracted from slide images using Tesseract OCR, then simplified instructions are generated via a general-purpose LLM, enabling real-time instructional support with minimal infrastructure. The system was evaluated in a live university course where student feedback (n=42) averaged 7.83/10, indicating strong perceived usefulness. A comparative study with multimodal LLMs that directly interpret slide images showed higher performance on visually dense slides, but the OCR-LLM pipeline provided comparable pedagogical value on text-centric slides with much lower computational overhead and cost. This work demonstrates that a lightweight, easily integrable pipeline can effectively extend legacy platforms with modern generative AI, offering scalable enhancements for student comprehension in technical education.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, accepted by IEEE FIE 2025</p></details> |

This article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning, which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning, which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities. Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7 for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58% respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under different missing types and rates.

However, no testbeds support application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types. Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models, including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages.

Conventional recommendation methodologies based on collaborative filtering or individual attributes encounter deficiencies in capturing nuanced user interests. Knowledge graphs and multimodal data integration offer enhanced representations of users and items with greater richness and precision. This paper reviews existing multimodal knowledge graph recommendation frameworks, identifying shortcomings in modal interaction and higher-order dependency modeling. We propose the Cross-Graph Cross-Modal Mutual Information-Driven Unified Knowledge Graph Learning and Recommendation Framework (CrossGMMI-DUKGLR), which employs pre-trained visual-text alignment models for feature extraction, achieves fine-grained modality fusion through multi-head cross-attention, and propagates higher-order adjacency information via graph attention networks.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks. Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC > 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR, where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes: information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information. Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM, which consists of 452 raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world AR scenario. To detect the attacks in the dataset, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only and text-only baselines.

This field is known as symbolic regression (SR). Traditional SR models are based on genetic programming (GP) or reinforcement learning (RL), facing well-known challenges, such as low efficiency and overfitting. Recent studies have integrated SR with large language models (LLMs), enabling fast zero-shot inference by learning mappings from millions of dataset-expression pairs. However, since the input and output are inherently different modalities, such models often struggle to converge effectively. In this paper, we introduce ViSymRe, a vision-guided multimodal SR model that incorporates the third resource, expression graph, to bridge the modality gap. Different from traditional multimodal models, ViSymRe is trained to extract vision, termed virtual vision, from datasets, without relying on the global availability of expression graphs, which addresses the essential challenge of visual SR, i.e., expression graphs are not available during inference. Evaluation results on multiple mainstream benchmarks show that ViSymRe achieves more competitive performance than the state-of-the-art dataset-only baselines. The expressions predicted by ViSymRe not only fit the dataset well but are also simple and structurally accurate, goals that SR models strive to achieve.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the biological mechanism, we present a sensorized soft anthropomorphic hand equipped with diverse sensors designed to emulate the sensory modalities of the human hand. This system incorporates biologically inspired encoding schemes that convert multimodal sensory data into spike trains, enabling highly-efficient processing through Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). By utilizing these neuromorphic signals, the proposed framework achieves 97.14% accuracy in object recognition across varying poses, significantly outperforming previous studies on soft hands. Additionally, we introduce a novel differentiator neuron model to enhance material classification by capturing dynamic thermal responses. Our results demonstrate the benefits of multimodal sensory fusion and highlight the potential of neuromorphic approaches for achieving efficient, robust, and human-like perception in robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

After training, only the prompts are shared by the clients with the central server for aggregation. However, textual prompt tuning suffers from overfitting to known concepts, limiting its generalizability to unseen concepts. To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Visual Prompt Tuning (FedMVP) that conditions the prompts on multimodal contextual information - derived from the input image and textual attribute features of a class. At the core of FedMVP is a PromptFormer module that synergistically aligns textual and visual features through a cross-attention mechanism. The dynamically generated multimodal visual prompts are then input to the frozen vision encoder of CLIP, and trained with a combination of CLIP similarity loss and a consistency loss. Extensive evaluation on 20 datasets, spanning three generalization settings, demonstrates that FedMVP not only preserves performance on in-distribution classes and domains, but also displays higher generalizability to unseen classes and domains, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin of +1.57% - 2.26%.

To address the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and spatial mismatches, this paper proposes an Adaptive Bidirectional Pyramid Difference Convolution (ABPDC) module that facilitates multimodal integration by exploiting the advantages of difference convolution in texture extraction and grayscale invariance, and a Feature Pyramid Registration Auxiliary Network (FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Current approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs' vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs. The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$ computational efficiency gains.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - remains formidable as it requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multifaceted cognitive process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational methods. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited to perform aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these hallucinations can be suppressed by employing an evidence-based and objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multifaceted, in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for image generation. Ultimately, we hope this work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and contribute to art that aligns with human aesthetic values.

Recently, the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in SR. However, we identify two critical challenges in existing LLM-based SR methods: 1) embedding collapse when incorporating pre-trained collaborative embeddings and 2) catastrophic forgetting of quantized embeddings when utilizing semantic IDs. These issues dampen the model scalability and lead to suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like Llama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding collapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve intra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations, respectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the model with the trained multimodal code embeddings. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM efficiently using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner. Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate the superior performance of MME-SID thanks to its capability to mitigate embedding collapse and catastrophic forgetting.

This paper proposes a shared control framework that combines a virtual admittance (VA) model with a Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception Network (MMIPN) to enhance teleoperation performance and user experience. The VA model employs artificial potential fields to guide operators toward target objects by adjusting admittance force and optimizing motion trajectories. MMIPN processes multimodal inputs, including gaze movement, robot motions, and environmental context, to estimate human grasping intentions, helping to overcome depth perception challenges in VR. Our user study evaluated four conditions across two factors, and the results showed that MMIPN significantly improved grasp success rates, while the VA model enhanced movement efficiency by reducing path lengths. Gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal cues with implicit guidance in VR-based teleoperation, providing a robust solution for multi-object grasping tasks and enabling more natural interactions across various applications in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISMAR 2025</p></details> |

However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic information distinct from that of natural imagery. In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models. Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content. We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within the broader landscape of vision-language integration.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

This paper introduces VSLLaVA, a comprehensive pipeline that utilizes expert knowledge-guided instruction tuning and evaluation to create an end-to-end LMM for signal analysis. To achieve this, we construct a novel Signal-Question-Answer (SQA) dataset using an expert rule-based signal generator. This dataset facilitates a two-stage learning procedure. The first step is efficient instruction fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which imparts specialized signal identification capabilities. Subsequently, we designed a tailored Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the reasoning capabilities and enhance classification robustness. Then, a dual-mode evaluation framework is proposed, combining an LLM referee with expert rules for semantic assessment using quantitative metrics for numerical and textual accuracy, which reveals that VSLLaVA significantly improves performance in signal type identification and parameter analysis, and makes progress in the identification and parameter analysis of fault-related signals. This research demonstrates a viable approach for developing specialized foundational models for complex industrial applications and marks a transition from conventional task-specific systems to a cohesive, interactive foundational model.</p></details> |  |

Following the prior vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder (and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2 competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x (from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB, equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation models.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has focused on individual tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework. State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and adaptive systems.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in such systems is the effective fusion of features from different modalities, which requires the extraction of rich and diverse semantic representations from each modality. To this end, we propose ProMSC-MIS, a Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic Communication system for Multi-spectral Image Segmentation. Specifically, we propose a pre-training algorithm where features from one modality serve as prompts for another, guiding unimodal semantic encoders to learn diverse and complementary semantic representations. We further introduce a semantic fusion module that combines cross-attention mechanisms and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) networks to effectively fuse cross-modal features. Simulation results show that ProMSC-MIS significantly outperforms benchmark methods across various channel-source compression levels, while maintaining low computational complexity and storage overhead. Our scheme has great potential for applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The full-length version, arXiv:2508.20057, has been updated</p></details> |

Previous suicide risk prediction studies have primarily focused on either textual or acoustic information in isolation, the integration of multimodal signals, such as speech and text, offers a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's mental state. Motivated by this, and in the context of the 1st SpeechWellness detection challenge, we explore a lightweight multi-branch multimodal system based on a dynamic fusion mechanism for speechwellness detection. To address the limitation of prior approaches that rely on time-domain waveforms for acoustic analysis, our system incorporates both time-domain and time-frequency (TF) domain acoustic features, as well as semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a dynamic fusion block to adaptively integrate information from different modalities. Specifically, it applies learnable weights to each modality during the fusion process, enabling the model to adjust the contribution of each modality. To enhance computational efficiency, we design a lightweight structure by simplifying the original baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits superior performance compared to the challenge baseline, achieving a 78% reduction in model parameters and a 5% improvement in accuracy.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5figures |

Yet, current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including 2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO) self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image understanding.</p></details> | Technical Report |

With the growing popularity of social media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch, opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods exhibit limitations in their modality-level reliance, constraining relational reasoning over fine-grained semantics for complex intent understanding. This paper proposes a novel LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the expansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic foundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance. Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors. Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable more effective relational reasoning. Extensive experiments on multimodal intent and dialogue act recognition tasks demonstrate LGSRR's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, with consistent performance gains across diverse semantic understanding scenarios.

However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g., trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs (multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2) Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without reliance on ground-truth trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infor...</summary><p>Information and Software Technology</p></details> |

Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Recently, with the integration of test-time scaling techniques, these models have also shown strong potential in visual reasoning. However, most existing reasoning approaches remain text-level in nature: MLLMs are prompted to explore various combinations of textual tokens via their underlying language model, while the visual input remains fixed throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm limits the model's ability to fully exploit rich visual information, particularly when dealing with images containing numerous fine-grained elements. In such cases, vision-level reasoning becomes crucial - where models dynamically zoom into specific regions of the image to gather detailed visual cues necessary for accurate decision-making. In this paper, we propose Zoom Eye, a training-free, model-agnostic tree search algorithm tailored for vision-level reasoning. Zoom Eye treats an image as a hierarchical tree structure, where each child node represents a zoomed-in sub-region of its parent, and the root corresponds to the full image. The algorithm enables MLLMs to simulate human-like zooming behavior by navigating from root to leaf nodes in search of task-relevant visual evidence. We experiment on a series of high-resolution benchmarks and the results demonstrate that Zoom Eye consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs by a large margin (e.g., InternVL2.5-8B increases by 15.71% and 17.69% on HR-Bench) and also enables small 3-8B MLLMs to outperform strong large models such as GPT-4o.

The dataset contains physiological and gaze data from 24 participants with self-reported cognitive load scores as ground-truth labels. The dataset consists of four modalities, namely, Electrocardiography (ECG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Electroencephalogram (EEG), and Gaze tracking. To map diverse levels of mental load on participants during experiments, each participant completed four nine-minutes sessions on a computer-based operator performance and mental workload task (the MATB-II software) with varying levels of complexity in one minute segments. During the experiment, participants reported their cognitive load every 10 seconds. For the dataset, we also provide benchmark binary classification results with machine learning and deep learning models on two different evaluation schemes, namely, 10-fold and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation. Benchmark results show that for 10-fold evaluation, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning model achieves the best classification performance with ECG, EDA, and Gaze. In contrast, for LOSO, the best performance is achieved by the deep learning model with ECG, EDA, and EEG.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment, using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data. We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more closely with long-term dynamics.

Most traditional image-based ReID methods face challenges including occlusions and lighting changes, while text provides complementary information to mitigate these issues. However, the integration of both image and text modalities remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose {\bf PS-ReID}, a multimodal model that combines image and text inputs to enhance ReID performance. In contrast to existing ReID methods limited by cropped pedestrian images, our PS-ReID focuses on full-scene settings and introduces a multimodal ReID task that incorporates segmentation, enabling precise feature extraction of the queried individual, even under challenging conditions such as occlusion. To this end, our model adopts a dual-path asymmetric encoding scheme that explicitly separates query and target roles: the query branch captures identity-discriminative cues, while the target branch performs holistic scene reasoning. Additionally, a token-level ReID loss supervises identity-aware tokens, coupling retrieval and segmentation to yield masks that are both spatially precise and identity-consistent. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we construct M2ReID, currently the largest full-scene multimodal ReID dataset, with over 200K images and 4,894 identities, featuring multimodal queries and high-quality segmentation masks. Experimental results demonstrate that PS-ReID significantly outperforms unimodal query-based models in both ReID and segmentation tasks. The model excels in challenging real-world scenarios such as occlusion, low lighting, and background clutter, offering a robust and flexible solution for person retrieval and segmentation. All code, models, and datasets will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Conventional vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search, Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

These studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result, modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization, but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba (CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding.

However, they face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods. This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems with stronger perceptual capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of accurate personalized VER.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other, resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt, producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability to harness complementary information from text and time series.

However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding: perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii) except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://videorewardbench.github.io/</p></details> |

We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries, retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation to real-world productivity.</p></details> | Preprint |

Despite significant progress in existing studies, two major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness. Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM. Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks, including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding.

This work introduces AQFusionNet, a multimodal deep learning framework for robust Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. The framework integrates ground-level atmospheric imagery with pollutant concentration data using lightweight CNN backbones (MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNet-B0). Visual and sensor features are combined through semantically aligned embedding spaces, enabling accurate and efficient prediction. Experiments on more than 8,000 samples from India and Nepal demonstrate that AQFusionNet consistently outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving up to 92.02% classification accuracy and an RMSE of 7.70 with the EfficientNet-B0 backbone. The model delivers an 18.5% improvement over single-modality approaches while maintaining low computational overhead, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices. AQFusionNet provides a scalable and practical solution for AQI monitoring in infrastructure-limited environments, offering robust predictive capability even under partial sensor availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

GMNER task exhibits two challenging attributes: 1) The tenuous correlation between images and text on social media contributes to a notable proportion of named entities being ungroundable. 2) There exists a distinction between coarse-grained noun phrases used in similar tasks (e.g., phrase localization) and fine-grained named entities. In this paper, we propose RiVEG, a unified framework that reformulates GMNER into a joint MNER-VE-VG task by leveraging large language models (LLMs) as connecting bridges. This reformulation brings two benefits: 1) It enables us to optimize the MNER module for optimal MNER performance and eliminates the need to pre-extract region features using object detection methods, thus naturally addressing the two major limitations of existing GMNER methods. 2) The introduction of Entity Expansion Expression module and Visual Entailment (VE) module unifies Visual Grounding (VG) and Entity Grounding (EG). This endows the proposed framework with unlimited data and model scalability. Furthermore, to address the potential ambiguity stemming from the coarse-grained bounding box output in GMNER, we further construct the new Segmented Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (SMNER) task and corresponding Twitter-SMNER dataset aimed at generating fine-grained segmentation masks, and experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using box prompt-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) to empower any GMNER model with the ability to accomplish the SMNER task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RiVEG significantly outperforms SoTA methods on four datasets across the MNER, GMNER, and SMNER tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of our Findings of EMNLP 2023 & ACL 2024 paper, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia accepted on July 19, 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results, thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great potential for generating automated Vlogs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://personavlog-paper.github.io/</p></details> |

However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration.

These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics, leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference speed.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Such multimodal data can be used to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes, such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents, observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents occurring at the same time and location.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, accepted at UrbComp 2025 KDD 2025</p></details> |

This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and 0.7294, respectively.

However, long post-click behavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume of data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training and inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage approaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete utilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating multimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents significant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens and mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the model's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest Network (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences contain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps, DMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete lifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no additional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing multimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from grouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors within each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers to capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally ordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that DMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios, despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space. Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer multimodal prognosis.

Effectively leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous data availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 16th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics (ACM-BCB 2025)</p></details> |

| **[PhotIQA: A photoacoustic image data set with image quality ratings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03478v1)** | 2025-07-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.03478v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is crucial in the evaluation stage of novel algorithms operating on images, including traditional and machine learning based methods. Due to the lack of available quality-rated medical images, most commonly used IQA methods employing reference images (i.e. full-reference IQA) have been developed and tested for natural images. Reported application inconsistencies arising when employing such measures for medical images are not surprising, as they rely on different properties than natural images. In photoacoustic imaging (PAI), especially, standard benchmarking approaches for assessing the quality of image reconstructions are lacking. PAI is a multi-physics imaging modality, in which two inverse problems have to be solved, which makes the application of IQA measures uniquely challenging due to both, acoustic and optical, artifacts. To support the development and testing of full- and no-reference IQA measures we assembled PhotIQA, a data set consisting of 1134 reconstructed photoacoustic (PA) images that were rated by 2 experts across five quality properties (overall quality, edge visibility, homogeneity, inclusion and background intensity), where the detailed rating enables usage beyond PAI. To allow full-reference assessment, highly characterised imaging test objects were used, providing a ground truth. Our baseline experiments show that HaarPSI$_{med}$ significantly outperforms SSIM in correlating with the quality ratings (SRCC: 0.83 vs. 0.62). The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13325196.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Digital twins enable full-reference quality assessment of photoacoustic image reconstructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24514v1)** | 2025-05-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.24514v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative comparison of the quality of photoacoustic image reconstruction algorithms remains a major challenge. No-reference image quality measures are often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and code are publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388429.</p></details> |  |
| **[Super-temporal-resolution Photoacoustic Imaging with Dynamic Reconstruction through Implicit Neural Representation in Sparse-view](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03175v1)** | 2025-05-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03175v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is an important imaging technique for monitoring physiological processes, capable of providing high-contrast images of optical absorption at much greater depths than traditional optical imaging methods. However, practical instrumentation and geometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the imaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data, produce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not consider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution is crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by the low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser technology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by characterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to improve dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and enhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input. Specifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as implicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the network are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the need for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong implicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit regularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms traditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions, effectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.</p></details> |  |

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Free-hand 3D Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Reconstruction using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03505v1)** | 2025-02-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.03505v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a motion-based learning network with a global-local self-attention module (MoGLo-Net) to enhance 3D reconstruction in handheld photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging. Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics.

In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2111.05194v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.13080v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2007.14747v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Deep neural networks have great potential in medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnosis and other healthcare issues, and is promoted in both pre-clinical and even clinical stages. In this review, we performed an overview of some new developments and challenges in the application of machine learning to medical image analysis, with a special focus on deep learning in photoacoustic imaging. The aim of this review is threefold: (i) introducing deep learning with some important basics, (ii) reviewing recent works that apply deep learning in the entire ecological chain of photoacoustic imaging, from image reconstruction to disease diagnosis, (iii) providing some open source materials and other resources for researchers interested in applying deep learning to photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A review of deep learning for photoacoustic imaging</p></details> |

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |
| **[Tattoo tomography: Freehand 3D photoacoustic image reconstruction with an optical pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04997v2)** | 2020-11-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.04997v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a novel imaging technique that can spatially resolve both morphological and functional tissue properties, such as the vessel topology and tissue oxygenation. While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem.
