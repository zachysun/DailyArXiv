| **[Strategies and Challenges of Efficient White-Box Training for Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08507v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition using time-series data from wearable sensors poses unique challenges due to complex temporal dependencies, sensor noise, placement variability, and diverse human behaviors. These factors, combined with the nontransparent nature of black-box Machine Learning models impede interpretability and hinder human comprehension of model behavior. This paper addresses these challenges by exploring strategies to enhance interpretability through white-box approaches, which provide actionable insights into latent space dynamics and model behavior during training. By leveraging human intuition and expertise, the proposed framework improves explainability, fosters trust, and promotes transparent Human Activity Recognition systems. A key contribution is the proposal of a Human-in-the-Loop framework that enables dynamic user interaction with models, facilitating iterative refinements to enhance performance and efficiency. Additionally, we investigate the usefulness of Large Language Model as an assistance to provide users with guidance for interpreting visualizations, diagnosing issues, and optimizing workflows. Together, these contributions present a scalable and efficient framework for developing interpretable and accessible Human Activity Recognition systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoPlant: Spatial Plant Species Prediction Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13928v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The difficulty of monitoring biodiversity at fine scales and over large areas limits ecological knowledge and conservation efforts. To fill this gap, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) predict species across space from spatially explicit features. Yet, they face the challenge of integrating the rich but heterogeneous data made available over the past decade, notably millions of opportunistic species observations and standardized surveys, as well as multimodal remote sensing data. In light of that, we have designed and developed a new European-scale dataset for SDMs at high spatial resolution (10--50m), including more than 10k species (i.e., most of the European flora). The dataset comprises 5M heterogeneous Presence-Only records and 90k exhaustive Presence-Absence survey records, all accompanied by diverse environmental rasters (e.g., elevation, human footprint, and soil) traditionally used in SDMs. In addition, it provides Sentinel-2 RGB and NIR satellite images with 10 m resolution, a 20-year time series of climatic variables, and satellite time series from the Landsat program. In addition to the data, we provide an openly accessible SDM benchmark (hosted on Kaggle), which has already attracted an active community and a set of strong baselines for single predictor/modality and multimodal approaches. All resources, e.g., the dataset, pre-trained models, and baseline methods (in the form of notebooks), are available on Kaggle, allowing one to start with our dataset literally with two mouse clicks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present \textsc{Proceed}, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. \textsc{Proceed} first operates by estimating the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, \textsc{Proceed} is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models. The empirical study demonstrates that our proposed \textsc{Proceed} brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025.

| **[Task-specific Self-body Controller Acquisition by Musculoskeletal Humanoids: Application to Pedal Control in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08270v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The musculoskeletal humanoid has many benefits that human beings have, but the modeling of its complex flexible body is difficult. Although we have developed an online acquisition method of the nonlinear relationship between joints and muscles, we could not completely match the actual robot and its self-body image. When realizing a certain task, the direct relationship between the control input and task state needs to be learned. So, we construct a neural network representing the time-series relationship between the control input and task state, and realize the intended task state by applying the network to a real-time control. In this research, we conduct accelerator pedal control experiments as one application, and verify the effectiveness of this study.</p></details> | Accepted at IROS2019 |
| **[Time-optimal persistent homology representatives for univariate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08209v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persistent homology (PH) is one of the main methods used in Topological Data Analysis. An active area of research in the field is the study of appropriate notions of PH representatives, which allow to interpret the meaning of the information provided by PH, making it an important problem in the application of PH, and in the study of its interpretability. Computing optimal PH representatives is a problem that is known to be NP-hard, and one is therefore interested in developing context-specific optimality notions that are computable in practice. Here we introduce time-optimal PH representatives for time-varying data, allowing one to extract representatives that are close in time in an appropriate sense. We illustrate our methods on quasi-periodic synthetic time series, as well as time series arising from climate models, and we show that our methods provide optimal PH representatives that are better suited for these types of problems than existing optimality notions, such as length-optimal PH representatives.</p></details> | 30 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Mixture of Online and Offline Experts for Non-stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05996v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a general and realistic scenario involving non-stationary time series, consisting of several offline intervals with different distributions within a fixed offline time horizon, and an online interval that continuously receives new samples. For non-stationary time series, the data distribution in the current online interval may have appeared in previous offline intervals. We theoretically explore the feasibility of applying knowledge from offline intervals to the current online interval. To this end, we propose the Mixture of Online and Offline Experts (MOOE). MOOE learns static offline experts from offline intervals and maintains a dynamic online expert for the current online interval. It then adaptively combines the offline and online experts using a meta expert to make predictions for the samples received in the online interval. Specifically, we focus on theoretical analysis, deriving parameter convergence, regret bounds, and generalization error bounds to prove the effectiveness of the algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tube Loss: A Novel Approach for Prediction Interval Estimation and probabilistic forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06853v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel loss function, called 'Tube Loss', for simultaneous estimation of bounds of a Prediction Interval (PI) in the regression setup, and also for generating probabilistic forecasts from time series data solving a single optimization problem. The PIs obtained by minimizing the empirical risk based on the Tube Loss are shown to be of better quality than the PIs obtained by the existing methods in the following sense. First, it yields intervals that attain the prespecified confidence level $t \in(0,1)$ asymptotically. A theoretical proof of this fact is given. Secondly, the user is allowed to move the interval up or down by controlling the value of a parameter. This helps the user to choose a PI capturing denser regions of the probability distribution of the response variable inside the interval, and thus, sharpening its width. This is shown to be especially useful when the conditional distribution of the response variable is skewed. Further, the Tube Loss based PI estimation method can trade-off between the coverage and the average width by solving a single optimization problem. It enables further reduction of the average width of PI through re-calibration. Also, unlike a few existing PI estimation methods the gradient descent (GD) method can be used for minimization of empirical risk. Finally, through extensive experimentation, we have shown the efficacy of the Tube Loss based PI estimation in kernel machines, neural networks and deep networks and also for probabilistic forecasting tasks. The codes of the experiments are available at https://github.com/ltpritamanand/Tube_loss</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Latent Non-Linear Dynamical System over Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08114v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of modeling a non-linear dynamical system when given a time series by deriving equations directly from the data. Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</p></details> | accepted at AAAI'25 |
| **[Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08099v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Accurate Prediction of Temperature Indicators in Eastern China Using a Multi-Scale CNN-LSTM-Attention model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07997v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the importance of accurate weather forecasting has become increasingly prominent due to the impacts of global climate change and the rapid development of data science. Traditional forecasting methods often struggle to handle the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in climate data. To address these challenges, we propose a weather prediction model based on a multi-scale convolutional CNN-LSTM-Attention architecture, specifically designed for time series forecasting of temperature data in China. The model integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and attention mechanisms to leverage the strengths of spatial feature extraction, temporal sequence modeling, and the ability to focus on important features. The development process of the model includes data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model building. Experimental results show that the model performs excellently in predicting temperature trends with high accuracy. The final computed results indicate that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is 1.978295 and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is 0.8106562. This work marks a significant advancement in applying deep learning techniques to meteorological data, offering a valuable tool for improving weather forecasting accuracy and providing essential support for decision-making in areas such as urban planning, agriculture, and energy management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representation Learning of Multivariate Time Series using Attention and Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01987v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical factor in trustworthy machine learning is to develop robust representations of the training data. Only under this guarantee methods are legitimate to artificially generate data, for example, to counteract imbalanced datasets or provide counterfactual explanations for blackbox decision-making systems. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown considerable results in forming stable representations and generating realistic data. While many applications focus on generating image data, less effort has been made in generating time series data, especially multivariate signals. In this work, a Transformer-based autoencoder is proposed that is regularized using an adversarial training scheme to generate artificial multivariate time series signals. The representation is evaluated using t-SNE visualizations, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Entropy scores. Our results indicate that the generated signals exhibit higher similarity to an exemplary dataset than using a convolutional network approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Chaotic Systems with Quantum Echo-state Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07910v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in artificial neural networks have enabled impressive tasks on classical computers, but they demand significant computational resources. While quantum computing offers potential beyond classical systems, the advantages of quantum neural networks (QNNs) remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present and examine a quantum circuit (QC) that implements and aims to improve upon the classical echo-state network (ESN), a type of reservoir-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs), using quantum computers. Typically, ESNs consist of an extremely large reservoir that learns high-dimensional embeddings, enabling prediction of complex system trajectories. Quantum echo-state networks (QESNs) aim to reduce this need for prohibitively large reservoirs by leveraging the unique capabilities of quantum computers, potentially allowing for more efficient and higher performing time-series prediction algorithms. The proposed QESN can be implemented on any digital quantum computer implementing a universal gate set, and does not require any sort of stopping or re-initialization of the circuit, allowing continuous evolution of the quantum state over long time horizons. We conducted simulated QC experiments on the chaotic Lorenz system, both with noisy and noiseless models, to demonstrate the circuit's performance and its potential for execution on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages, 4 figures, submitted to AAAI QC+AI workshop</p></details> |
| **[FlashRNN: Optimizing Traditional RNNs on Modern Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07752v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}</p></details> |  |
| **[Right on Time: Revising Time Series Models by Constraining their Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12921v4)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliability of deep time series models is often compromised by their tendency to rely on confounding factors, which may lead to incorrect outputs. Our newly recorded, naturally confounded dataset named P2S from a real mechanical production line emphasizes this. To avoid "Clever-Hans" moments in time series, i.e., to mitigate confounders, we introduce the method Right on Time (RioT). RioT enables, for the first time, interactions with model explanations across both the time and frequency domain. Feedback on explanations in both domains is then used to constrain the model, steering it away from the annotated confounding factors. The dual-domain interaction strategy is crucial for effectively addressing confounders in time series datasets. We empirically demonstrate that RioT can effectively guide models away from the wrong reasons in P2S as well as popular time series classification and forecasting datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqRISE: Explaining time series using frequency masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13584v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data are fundamentally important for many critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and climate, where explainable models are necessary for safe automated decision making. To develop explainable artificial intelligence in these domains therefore implies explaining salient information in the time series. Current methods for obtaining saliency maps assume localized information in the raw input space. In this paper, we argue that the salient information of a number of time series is more likely to be localized in the frequency domain. We propose FreqRISE, which uses masking-based methods to produce explanations in the frequency and time-frequency domain, and outperforms strong baselines across a number of tasks. The source code is available here: \url{https://github.com/theabrusch/FreqRISE}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Northern Lights Deep Learning Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-based model validation using a custom metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07521v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle models have a long history of research and as of today are able to model the involved physics in a reasonable manner. However, each new vehicle has its new characteristics or parameters. The identification of these is the main task of an engineer. To validate whether the correct parameter set has been chosen is a tedious task and often can only be performed by experts. Metrics known commonly used in literature are able to compare different results under certain aspects. However, they fail to answer the question: Are the models accurate enough? In this article, we propose the usage of a custom metric trained on the knowledge of experts to tackle this problem. Our approach involves three main steps: first, the formalized collection of subject matter experts' opinion on the question: Having seen the measurement and simulation time series in comparison, is the model quality sufficient? From this step, we obtain a data set that is able to quantify the sufficiency of a simulation result based on a comparison to corresponding experimental data. In a second step, we compute common model metrics on the measurement and simulation time series and use these model metrics as features to a regression model. Third, we fit a regression model to the experts' opinions. This regression model, i.e., our custom metric, can than predict the sufficiency of a new simulation result and gives a confidence on this prediction.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Among these advancements, deep learning and predictive modelling have emerged as transformative tools for optimizing clinical trial design, patient recruitment, and real-time monitoring. This study explores the application of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks [CNNs] and transformerbased models, to stratify patients, forecast adverse events, and personalize treatment plans. Furthermore, predictive modelling approaches, including survival analysis and time-series forecasting, are employed to predict trial outcomes, enhancing efficiency and reducing trial failure rates. To address challenges in analysing unstructured clinical data, such as patient notes and trial protocols, natural language processing [NLP] techniques are utilized for extracting actionable insights. A custom dataset comprising structured patient demographics, genomic data, and unstructured text is curated for training and validating these models. Key metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 scores, are used to evaluate model performance, while trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency are examined to identify the optimal model for clinical deployment. This research underscores the potential of AI-driven methods to streamline clinical trial workflows, improve patient-centric outcomes, and reduce costs associated with trial inefficiencies. The findings provide a robust framework for integrating predictive analytics into precision medicine, paving the way for more adaptive and efficient clinical trials. By bridging the gap between technological innovation and real-world applications, this study contributes to advancing the role of AI in healthcare, particularly in fostering personalized care and improving overall trial success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages excluding references, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[The broader spectrum of in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03782v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit $\unicode{x2014}$ such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[SigKAN: Signature-Weighted Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17890v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach that enhances multivariate function approximation using learnable path signatures and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs). We enhance the learning capabilities of these networks by weighting the values obtained by KANs using learnable path signatures, which capture important geometric features of paths. This combination allows for a more comprehensive and flexible representation of sequential and temporal data. We demonstrate through studies that our SigKANs with learnable path signatures perform better than conventional methods across a range of function approximation challenges. By leveraging path signatures in neural networks, this method offers intriguing opportunities to enhance performance in time series analysis and time series forecasting, among other fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.07344, arXiv:2406.02486</p></details> |
| **[Deep learning for predicting the occurrence of tipping points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18693v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tipping points occur in many real-world systems, at which the system shifts suddenly from one state to another. The ability to predict the occurrence of tipping points from time series data remains an outstanding challenge and a major interest in a broad range of research fields. Particularly, the widely used methods based on bifurcation theory are neither reliable in prediction accuracy nor applicable for irregularly-sampled time series which are commonly observed from real-world systems. Here we address this challenge by developing a deep learning algorithm for predicting the occurrence of tipping points in untrained systems, by exploiting information about normal forms. Our algorithm not only outperforms traditional methods for regularly-sampled model time series but also achieves accurate predictions for irregularly-sampled model time series and empirical time series. Our ability to predict tipping points for complex systems paves the way for mitigation risks, prevention of catastrophic failures, and restoration of degraded systems, with broad applications in social science, engineering, and biology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF) for Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14599v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) models can generate high-quality samples from a non-informative prior, but they can be slow, often needing hundreds of network evaluations (NFE). To address this, we propose Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF); IDFF learns a new vector field with an additional momentum term that enables taking longer steps during sample generation while maintaining the fidelity of the generated distribution. Consequently, IDFFs reduce the NFEs by a factor of ten (relative to CFMs) without sacrificing sample quality, enabling rapid sampling and efficient handling of image and time-series data generation tasks. We evaluate IDFF on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and CelebA for image generation, where we achieve likelihood and quality performance comparable to CFMs and diffusion-based models with fewer NFEs. IDFF also shows superior performance on time-series datasets modeling, including molecular simulation and sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness across different domains.\href{https://github.com/MrRezaeiUofT/IDFF}{Github Repository}</p></details> |  |
| **[Food for thought: How can machine learning help better predict and understand changes in food prices?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06472v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address a lack of systematic understanding of fluctuations in food affordability in Canada. Canada's Food Price Report (CPFR) is an annual publication that predicts food inflation over the next calendar year. The published predictions are a collaborative effort between forecasting teams that each employ their own approach at Canadian Universities: Dalhousie University, the University of British Columbia, the University of Saskatchewan, and the University of Guelph/Vector Institute. While the University of Guelph/Vector Institute forecasting team has leveraged machine learning (ML) in previous reports, the most recent editions (2024--2025) have also included a human-in-the-loop approach. For the 2025 report, this focus was expanded to evaluate several different data-centric approaches to improve forecast accuracy. In this study, we evaluate how different types of forecasting models perform when estimating food price fluctuations. We also examine the sensitivity of models that curate time series data representing key factors in food pricing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variable Selection for Comparing High-dimensional Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06870v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a pair of multivariate time-series data of the same length and dimensions, an approach is proposed to select variables and time intervals where the two series are significantly different. In applications where one time series is an output from a computationally expensive simulator, the approach may be used for validating the simulator against real data, for comparing the outputs of two simulators, and for validating a machine learning-based emulator against the simulator. With the proposed approach, the entire time interval is split into multiple subintervals, and on each subinterval, the two sample sets are compared to select variables that distinguish their distributions and a two-sample test is performed. The validity and limitations of the proposed approach are investigated in synthetic data experiments. Its usefulness is demonstrated in an application with a particle-based fluid simulator, where a deep neural network model is compared against the simulator, and in an application with a microscopic traffic simulator, where the effects of changing the simulator's parameters on traffic flows are analysed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Impact of Synthetic Data on Human Gesture Recognition Tasks Using GANs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06389v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there is an emerging interest in employing Deep Generative Models (DGMs) to address data scarcity, enhance data quality, and improve classification metrics scores. Among these types of models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have arisen as a powerful tool for generating synthetic data that mimic real-world scenarios with high fidelity. However, Human Gesture Recognition (HGR), a subset of HAR, particularly in healthcare applications, using time series data such as allergic gestures, remains highly unexplored. In this paper, we examine and evaluate the performance of two GANs in the generation of synthetic gesture motion data that compose a part of an open-source benchmark dataset. The data is related to the disease identification domain and healthcare, specifically to allergic rhinitis. We also focus on these AI models' performance in terms of fidelity, diversity, and privacy. Furthermore, we examine the scenario if the synthetic data can substitute real data, in training scenarios and how well models trained on synthetic data can be generalized for the allergic rhinitis gestures. In our work, these gestures are related to 6-axes accelerometer and gyroscope data, serving as multi-variate time series instances, and retrieved from smart wearable devices. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the feasibility of synthesizing motion gestures for allergic rhinitis from wearable IoT device data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and testing their impact on the generalization of gesture recognition systems. It is worth noting that, even if our method has been applied to a specific category of gestures, it is designed to be generalized and can be deployed also to other motion data in the HGR domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 20th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT), 2024</p></details> |
| **[Measuring Pre-training Data Quality without Labels for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06368v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in time series foundation models that generalize across different downstream tasks. A key to strong foundation models is a diverse pre-training dataset, which is particularly challenging to collect for time series classification. In this work, we explore the performance of a contrastive-learning-based foundation model as a function of the data used for pre-training. We introduce contrastive accuracy, a new measure to evaluate the quality of the representation space learned by the foundation model. Our experiments reveal the positive correlation between the proposed measure and the accuracy of the model on a collection of downstream tasks. This suggests that the contrastive accuracy can serve as a criterion to search for time series datasets that can enhance the pre-training and improve thereby the foundation model's generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMS-AutoTSF: Learnable Multi-Scale Decomposition and Integrated Autocorrelation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06866v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is an important challenge with significant applications in areas such as weather prediction, stock market analysis, scientific simulations and industrial process analysis. In this work, we introduce LMS-AutoTSF, a novel time series forecasting architecture that incorporates autocorrelation while leveraging dual encoders operating at multiple scales. Unlike models that rely on predefined trend and seasonal components, LMS-AutoTSF employs two separate encoders per scale: one focusing on low-pass filtering to capture trends and the other utilizing high-pass filtering to model seasonal variations. These filters are learnable, allowing the model to dynamically adapt and isolate trend and seasonal components directly in the frequency domain. A key innovation in our approach is the integration of autocorrelation, achieved by computing lagged differences in time steps, which enables the model to capture dependencies across time more effectively. Each encoder processes the input through fully connected layers to handle temporal and channel interactions. By combining frequency-domain filtering, autocorrelation-based temporal modeling, and channel-wise transformations, LMS-AutoTSF not only accurately captures long-term dependencies and fine-grained patterns but also operates more efficiently compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Its lightweight design ensures faster processing while maintaining high precision in forecasting across diverse time horizons.

In wireless communication systems, CSI provides essential insights into channel conditions, enabling system optimizations like channel compensation and dynamic resource allocation. However, the high computational complexity of CSI estimation algorithms necessitates the development of fast deep learning methods for CSI prediction. In wireless sensing systems, CSI can be leveraged to infer environmental changes, facilitating various functions, including gesture recognition and people identification. Deep learning methods have demonstrated significant advantages over model-based approaches in these fine-grained CSI classification tasks, particularly when classes vary across different scenarios. However, a major challenge in training deep learning networks for wireless systems is the limited availability of data, further complicated by the diverse formats of many public datasets, which hinder integration. Additionally, collecting CSI data can be resource-intensive, requiring considerable time and manpower. To address these challenges, we propose CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks, effectively utilizing limited data through a pre-training and fine-tuning approach. Building on CSI-BERT1, we enhance the model architecture by introducing an Adaptive Re-Weighting Layer (ARL) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to better capture sub-carrier and timestamp information, effectively addressing the permutation-invariance problem. Furthermore, we propose a Mask Prediction Model (MPM) fine-tuning method to improve the model's adaptability for CSI prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses a significant challenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, by reformulating it as a time-series segmentation task inherently suited for SNN execution. Automated RFI detection systems capable of real-time operation with minimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio telescopes. We explore several spectrogram-to-spike encoding methods and network parameters, applying first-order leaky integrate-and-fire SNNs to tackle RFI detection. To enhance the contrast between RFI and background information, we introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing step, which improves detection performance across multiple encoding strategies. Our approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and compelling results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) instrument. To our knowledge, this work is the first to train SNNs on real radio astronomy data successfully. These findings highlight the potential of SNNs for performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way for efficient, real-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables.

These changes are rendering the electric grid more volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult to maintain reliable operations. In order to address these issues, advanced time series prediction models are needed for closing the gap between the forecasted and actual grid outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate time series prediction model that combines traditional state space models with deep learning methods to simultaneously capture and predict the underlying dynamics of multiple time series. Additionally, we design a time series processing module that incorporates high-resolution external forecasts into sequence-to-sequence prediction models, achieving this with negligible increases in size and no loss of accuracy. We also release an extended dataset spanning five years of load, electricity price, ancillary service price, and renewable generation. To complement this dataset, we provide an open-access toolbox that includes our proposed model, the dataset itself, and several state-of-the-art prediction models, thereby creating a unified framework for benchmarking advanced machine learning approaches. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing models across various prediction tasks, improving state-of-the-art prediction error by an average of 7% and decreasing model parameters by 43%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the Journal of IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |

As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter</p></details> |
| **[Curse of Attention: A Kernel-Based Perspective for Why Transformers Fail to Generalize on Time Series Forecasting and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06061v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of transformer-based models on time series forecasting (TSF) tasks has long been popular to study. However, many of these works fail to beat the simple linear residual model, and the theoretical understanding of this issue is still limited. In this work, we propose the first theoretical explanation of the inefficiency of transformers on TSF tasks. We attribute the mechanism behind it to {\bf Asymmetric Learning} in training attention networks. When the sign of the previous step is inconsistent with the sign of the current step in the next-step-prediction time series, attention fails to learn the residual features. This makes it difficult to generalize on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially on the sign-inconsistent next-step-prediction data, with the same representation pattern, whereas a linear residual network could easily accomplish it. We hope our theoretical insights provide important necessary conditions for designing the expressive and efficient transformer-based architecture for practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[TableTime: Reformulating Time Series Classification as Zero-Shot Table Understanding via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15737v2)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArrivalNet: Predicting City-wide Bus/Tram Arrival Time with Two-dimensional Temporal Variation Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14742v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate arrival time prediction (ATP) of buses and trams plays a crucial role in public transport operations. Current methods focused on modeling one-dimensional temporal information but overlooked the latent periodic information within time series. Moreover, most studies developed algorithms for ATP based on a single or a few routes of public transport, which reduces the transferability of the prediction models and their applicability in public transport management systems. To this end, this paper proposes \textit{ArrivalNet}, a two-dimensional temporal variation-based multi-step ATP for buses and trams. It decomposes the one-dimensional temporal sequence into intra-periodic and inter-periodic variations, which can be recast into two-dimensional tensors (2D blocks). Each row of a tensor contains the time points within a period, and each column involves the time points at the same intra-periodic index across various periods. The transformed 2D blocks in different frequencies have an image-like feature representation that enables effective learning with computer vision backbones (e.g., convolutional neural network). Drawing on the concept of residual neural network, the 2D block module is designed as a basic module for flexible aggregation. Meanwhile, contextual factors like workdays, peak hours, and intersections, are also utilized in the augmented feature representation to improve the performance of prediction. 125 days of public transport data from Dresden were collected for model training and validation. Experimental results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of the proposed predictor decrease by at least 6.1\%, 14.7\%, and 34.2\% compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transportation Marketplace Rate Forecast Using Signature Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04857v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Freight transportation marketplace rates are typically challenging to forecast accurately. In this work, we have developed a novel statistical technique based on signature transforms and have built a predictive and adaptive model to forecast these marketplace rates. Our technique is based on two key elements of the signature transform: one being its universal nonlinearity property, which linearizes the feature space and hence translates the forecasting problem into linear regression, and the other being the signature kernel, which allows for comparing computationally efficiently similarities between time series data. Combined, it allows for efficient feature generation and precise identification of seasonality and regime switching in the forecasting process. An algorithm based on our technique has been deployed by Amazon trucking operations, with far superior forecast accuracy and better interpretability versus commercially available industry models, even during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine conflict. Furthermore, our technique is able to capture the influence of business cycles and the heterogeneity of the marketplace, improving prediction accuracy by more than fivefold, with an estimated annualized saving of \$50MM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Time-Series Foundation Model for Subsurface Well Logs Prediction and Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05681v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise in energy demand highlights the importance of suitable subsurface storage, requiring detailed and accurate subsurface characterization often reliant on high-quality borehole well log data. However, obtaining complete well-log data is costly and time-consuming, with missing data being common due to borehole conditions or tool errors. While machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented to address these issues, they often fail to capture the intricate, nonlinear relationships and long-term dependencies in complex well log sequences. Additionally, prior AI-driven models typically require retraining when introduced to new datasets and are constrained to deployment in the same basin. In this study, we explored and evaluated the potential of a time-series foundation model leveraging transformer architecture and a generative pre-trained approach for predicting and detecting anomalies in borehole well log data. Specifically, we fine-tuned and adopted the TimeGPT architecture to forecast key log responses and detect anomalies with high accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving R2 of up to 87% and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as low as 1.95%. Additionally, the model's zero-shot capability successfully identified subtle yet critical anomalies, such as drilling hazards or unexpected geological formations, with an overall accuracy of 93%. The model represents a significant advancement in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling zero-shot inference through fine-tuning. Its application in well-log prediction enhances operational decision-making while reducing risks associated with subsurface exploration. These findings demonstrate the model's potential to transform well-log data analysis, particularly in complex geological settings.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively capturing both the global sequence dependence and local detail features within time series data remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel generative self-supervised method called TimeDART, denoting Diffusion Auto-regressive Transformer for Time series forecasting. In TimeDART, we treat time series patches as basic modeling units. Specifically, we employ an self-attention based Transformer encoder to model the dependencies of inter-patches. Additionally, we introduce diffusion and denoising mechanisms to capture the detail locality features of intra-patch. Notably, we design a cross-attention-based denoising decoder that allows for adjustable optimization difficulty in the self-supervised task, facilitating more effective self-supervised pre-training. Furthermore, the entire model is optimized in an auto-regressive manner to obtain transferable representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeDART achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance compared to the most advanced competitive methods in forecasting tasks.

A similar storming occurred in Brazil in 2023. Although both attacks were instances in longer sequences of events, these have provided a testimony for many observers who had claimed that online actions, including the propagation of disinformation, have offline consequences. Soon after, a number of papers have been published about the relation between online disinformation and offline violence, among other related relations. Hitherto, the effects upon political protests have been unexplored. This paper thus evaluates such effects with a time series cross-sectional sample of 125 countries in a period between 2000 and 2019. The results are mixed. Based on Bayesian multi-level regression modeling, (i) there indeed is an effect between online disinformation and offline protests, but the effect is partially meditated by political polarization. The results are clearer in a sample of countries belonging to the European Economic Area. With this sample, (ii) offline protest counts increase from online disinformation disseminated by domestic governments, political parties, and politicians as well as by foreign governments. Furthermore, (iii) Internet shutdowns tend to decrease the counts, although, paradoxically, the absence of governmental online monitoring of social media tends to also decrease these. With these results, the paper contributes to the blossoming disinformation research by modeling the impact of disinformation upon offline phenomenon. The contribution is important due to the various policy measures planned or already enacted.</p></details> | <details><summary>Note ...</summary><p>Note that there is a divergence between this pre-print and the publisher's definite version available via the DOI.

Deep learning methods have become the mainstream research direction due to their excellent performance. However, new viewpoints have emerged in recent TSAD research. Deep learning is not required for TSAD due to limitations such as slow deep learning speed. The Broad Learning System (BLS) is a shallow network framework that benefits from its ease of optimization and speed. It has been shown to outperform machine learning approaches while remaining competitive with deep learning. Based on the current situation of TSAD, we propose the Contrastive Patch-based Broad Learning System (CPatchBLS). This is a new exploration of patching technique and BLS, providing a new perspective for TSAD. We construct Dual-PatchBLS as a base through patching and Simple Kernel Perturbation (SKP) and utilize contrastive learning to capture the differences between normal and abnormal data under different representations. To compensate for the temporal semantic loss caused by various patching, we propose CPatchBLS with model level integration, which takes advantage of BLS's fast feature to build model-level integration and improve model detection. Using five real-world series anomaly detection datasets, we confirmed the method's efficacy, outperforming previous deep learning and machine learning methods while retaining a high level of computing efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, Under review</p></details> |

While Transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing temporal dependencies, their application to extended sequences is limited by computational inefficiencies and limited generalization. In this study, we propose KEDformer, a knowledge extraction-driven framework that integrates seasonal-trend decomposition to address these challenges. KEDformer leverages knowledge extraction methods that focus on the most informative weights within the self-attention mechanism to reduce computational overhead. Additionally, the proposed KEDformer framework decouples time series into seasonal and trend components. This decomposition enhances the model's ability to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term patterns. Extensive experiments on five public datasets from energy, transportation, and weather domains demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of KEDformer, providing an efficient solution for long-term time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Computational musculoskeletal modeling has been widely used as a powerful non-invasive tool to estimate them through inverse dynamics using static optimization, but the inherent computational complexity results in time-consuming analysis. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based deep learning framework for time-efficient inverse dynamic analysis, which can predict muscle activation and muscle forces from joint kinematic data directly while not requiring any label information during model training. The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) neural network is selected as the backbone of our model due to its proficient handling of time-series data. Prior physical knowledge from forward dynamics and pre-selected inverse dynamics based physiological criteria are integrated into the loss function to guide the training of neural networks. Experimental validations on two datasets, including one benchmark upper limb movement dataset and one self-collected lower limb movement dataset from six healthy subjects, are performed. The experimental results have shown that the selected BiGRU architecture outperforms other neural network models when trained using our specifically designed loss function, which illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, Journal paper</p></details> |

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

Tokenization is a crucial consideration in this effort: what is an effective discrete vocabulary for a real-valued sequential input? To address this question, we develop WaveToken, a wavelet-based tokenizer that allows models to learn complex representations directly in the space of time-localized frequencies. Our method first scales and decomposes the input time series, then thresholds and quantizes the wavelet coefficients, and finally pre-trains an autoregressive model to forecast coefficients for the forecast horizon. By decomposing coarse and fine structures in the inputs, wavelets provide an eloquent and compact language for time series forecasting that simplifies learning. Empirical results on a comprehensive benchmark, including 42 datasets for both in-domain and zero-shot settings, show that WaveToken: i) provides better accuracy than recently proposed foundation models for forecasting while using a much smaller vocabulary (1024 tokens), and performs on par or better than modern deep learning models trained specifically on each dataset; and ii) exhibits superior generalization capabilities, achieving the best average rank across all datasets for three complementary metrics. In addition, we show that our method can easily capture complex temporal patterns of practical relevance that are challenging for other recent pre-trained models, including trends, sparse spikes, and non-stationary time series with varying frequencies evolving over time.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |

Several post-hoc methods have emerged in recent years, but when applied to a given task, they produce different results, raising the question of which method is the most suitable to provide correct post-hoc interpretability. To understand the performance of each method, quantitative evaluation of interpretability methods is essential. However, currently available frameworks have several drawbacks which hinders the adoption of post-hoc interpretability methods, especially in high-risk sectors. In this work, we propose a framework with quantitative metrics to assess the performance of existing post-hoc interpretability methods in particular in time series classification. We show that several drawbacks identified in the literature are addressed, namely dependence on human judgement, retraining, and shift in the data distribution when occluding samples. We additionally design a synthetic dataset with known discriminative features and tunable complexity. The proposed methodology and quantitative metrics can be used to understand the reliability of interpretability methods results obtained in practical applications. In turn, they can be embedded within operational workflows in critical fields that require accurate interpretability results for e.g., regulatory policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>New v...</summary><p>New version to match published version in Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Similarity Measures for the Evaluation of Human-Robot Motion Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04820v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One key area of research in Human-Robot Interaction is solving the human-robot correspondence problem, which asks how a robot can learn to reproduce a human motion demonstration when the human and robot have different dynamics and kinematic structures. Evaluating these correspondence problem solutions often requires the use of qualitative surveys that can be time consuming to design and administer. Additionally, qualitative survey results vary depending on the population of survey participants. In this paper, we propose the use of heterogeneous time-series similarity measures as a quantitative evaluation metric for evaluating motion correspondence to complement these qualitative surveys. To assess the suitability of these measures, we develop a behavioral cloning-based motion correspondence model, and evaluate it with a qualitative survey as well as quantitative measures. By comparing the resulting similarity scores with the human survey results, we identify Gromov Dynamic Time Warping as a promising quantitative measure for evaluating motion correspondence.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

While recent work has shown great potential for adapting the learned prior of LLMs, the formulation of the prompt to finetune LLMs remains challenging as prompt should be aligned with time series data. Additionally, current approaches do not effectively leverage word token embeddings which embody the rich representation space learned by LLMs. This emphasizes the need for a robust approach to formulate the prompt which utilizes the word token embeddings while effectively representing the characteristics of the time series. To address these challenges, we propose NNCL-TLLM: Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning for Time series forecasting via LLMs. First, we generate time series compatible text prototypes such that each text prototype represents both word token embeddings in its neighborhood and time series characteristics via end-to-end finetuning. Next, we draw inspiration from Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning to formulate the prompt while obtaining the top-$k$ nearest neighbor time series compatible text prototypes. We then fine-tune the layer normalization and positional embeddings of the LLM, keeping the other layers intact, reducing the trainable parameters and decreasing the computational cost. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NNCL-TLLM outperforms in few-shot forecasting while achieving competitive or superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

Addressing RFI involves intricate heuristic algorithms, manual examination, and, increasingly, machine learning methods. Given the dynamic and temporal nature of radio astronomy observations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emerge as a promising approach. In this study, we cast RFI detection as a supervised multi-variate time-series segmentation problem. Notably, our investigation explores the encoding of radio astronomy visibility data for SNN inference, considering six encoding schemes: rate, latency, delta-modulation, and three variations of the step-forward algorithm. We train a small twolayer fully connected SNN on simulated data derived from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope and perform extensive hyper-parameter optimization. Results reveal that latency encoding exhibits superior performance, achieving a per-pixel accuracy of 98.8% and an f1-score of 0.761. Remarkably, these metrics approach those of contemporary RFI detection algorithms, notwithstanding the simplicity and compactness of our proposed network architecture. This study underscores the potential of RFI detection as a benchmark problem for SNN researchers, emphasizing the efficacy of SNNs in addressing complex time-series segmentation tasks in radio astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables.

Ideally, machine learning models should be trained on and applied to data from the same distributions. However, the data evolves over time in many application areas, leading to data and concept drift, which in turn causes the performance of the ML models to degrade over time. Therefore, maintaining up to date ML models plays a critical role in the MLOps pipeline. Existing ML model maintenance approaches are often computationally resource intensive, costly, time consuming, and model dependent. Thus, we propose an improved MLOps pipeline, a new model maintenance approach and a Similarity Based Model Reuse (SimReuse) tool to address the challenges of ML model maintenance. We identify seasonal and recurrent distribution patterns in time series datasets throughout a preliminary study. Recurrent distribution patterns enable us to reuse previously trained models for similar distributions in the future, thus avoiding frequent retraining. Then, we integrated the model reuse approach into the MLOps pipeline and proposed our improved MLOps pipeline. Furthermore, we develop SimReuse, a tool to implement the new components of our MLOps pipeline to store models and reuse them for inference of data segments with similar data distributions in the future. Our evaluation results on four time series datasets demonstrate that our model reuse approach can maintain the performance of models while significantly reducing maintenance time and costs. Our model reuse approach achieves ML performance comparable to the best baseline, while being 15 times more efficient in terms of computation time and costs. Therefore, industries and practitioners can benefit from our approach and use our tool to maintain the performance of their ML models in the deployment phase to reduce their maintenance costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 Pa...</summary><p>34 Pages, 25 Figures, 12 Tables, 1 Algorithm, Submitted to a journal</p></details> |

Some PNAs have also shown emergent domain wall dynamics. Previous works have demonstrated methods to physically probe these magnetization dynamics of PNAs to realize neuromorphic reservoir systems that exhibit chaotic dynamical behavior and high-dimensional nonlinearity. These PNA reservoir systems from prior works leverage echo state properties and linear/nonlinear short-term memory of component reservoir nodes to map and preserve the dynamical information of the input time-series data into nondelay spatial embeddings. Such mappings enable these PNA reservoir systems to imitate and predict/forecast the input time series data. However, these prior PNA reservoir systems are based solely on the nondelay spatial embeddings obtained at component reservoir nodes. As a result, they require a massive number of component reservoir nodes, or a very large spatial embedding (i.e., high-dimensional spatial embedding) per reservoir node, or both, to achieve acceptable imitation and prediction accuracy. These requirements reduce the practical feasibility of such PNA reservoir systems. To address this shortcoming, we present a mixed delay/nondelay embeddings-based PNA reservoir system. Our system uses a single PNA reservoir node with the ability to obtain a mixture of delay/nondelay embeddings of the dynamical information of the time-series data applied at the input of a single PNA reservoir node. Our analysis shows that when these mixed delay/nondelay embeddings are used to train a perceptron at the output layer, our reservoir system outperforms existing PNA-based reservoir systems for the imitation of NARMA 2, NARMA 5, NARMA 7, and NARMA 10 time series data, and for the short-term and long-term prediction of the Mackey Glass time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving High-dimensional Inverse Problems Using Amortized Likelihood-free Inference with Noisy and Incomplete Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04565v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel likelihood-free probabilistic inversion method based on normalizing flows for high-dimensional inverse problems. The proposed method is comprised of two complementary networks: a summary network for data compression, and an inference network for parameter estimation. The summary network encodes raw observations into a fixed-size vector of summary statistics, while the inference network generates samples of the approximate posterior distribution of the model parameters based on these summary statistics. The posterior samples are produced in a deep generative fashion by sampling from a latent Gaussian distribution and passing these samples through an invertible transformation. We construct this invertible transformation by sequentially alternating conditional invertible neural network (cINN) and conditional neural spline flow (cNSF) layers. The summary and inference networks are trained simultaneously. We apply the proposed method to an inversion problem in groundwater hydrology to estimate the posterior distribution of the system's log-conductivity field conditioned on spatially sparse time-series observations of the system's hydraulic head responses. The conductivity field is represented with 706 degrees of freedom in the considered problem. The comparison with the likelihood-based iterative ensemble smoother PEST-IES method demonstrates that the proposed method accurately estimates the parameter posterior distribution and the observations' predictive posterior distribution at a fraction of the inference time of PEST-IES.</p></details> |  |

This paper studies machine learning that detect drifts in process curve datasets. A theoretic framework to synthetically generate process curves in a controlled way is introduced in order to benchmark machine learning algorithms for process drift detection. An evaluation score, called the temporal area under the curve, is introduced, which allows to quantify how well machine learning models unveil curves belonging to drift segments. Finally, a benchmark study comparing popular machine learning approaches on synthetic data generated with the introduced framework is presented that shows that existing algorithms often struggle with datasets containing multiple drift segments.</p></details> |  |
| **[WinTSR: A Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling Method for Interpreting Time Series Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04532v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting complex time series forecasting models is challenging due to the temporal dependencies between time steps and the dynamic relevance of input features over time. Existing interpretation methods are limited by focusing mostly on classification tasks, evaluating using custom baseline models instead of the latest time series models, using simple synthetic datasets, and requiring training another model. We introduce a novel interpretation method called Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR) addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression. Our comprehensive analysis shows that WinTSR significantly outranks the other local interpretation methods in overall performance. Finally, we provide a novel and open-source framework to interpret the latest time series transformers and foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact: Exploring Space-Time Perceptive Clues for Weakly Supervised Satellite Image Time Series Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03968v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated crop mapping through Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) has emerged as a crucial avenue for agricultural monitoring and management. However, due to the low resolution and unclear parcel boundaries, annotating pixel-level masks is exceptionally complex and time-consuming in SITS. This paper embraces the weakly supervised paradigm (i.e., only image-level categories available) to liberate the crop mapping task from the exhaustive annotation burden. The unique characteristics of SITS give rise to several challenges in weakly supervised learning: (1) noise perturbation from spatially neighboring regions, and (2) erroneous semantic bias from anomalous temporal periods. To address the above difficulties, we propose a novel method, termed exploring space-time perceptive clues (Exact). First, we introduce a set of spatial clues to explicitly capture the representative patterns of different crops from the most class-relative regions. Besides, we leverage the temporal-to-class interaction of the model to emphasize the contributions of pivotal clips, thereby enhancing the model perception for crop regions. Build upon the space-time perceptive clues, we derive the clue-based CAMs to effectively supervise the SITS segmentation network. Our method demonstrates impressive performance on various SITS benchmarks. Remarkably, the segmentation network trained on Exact-generated masks achieves 95% of its fully supervised performance, showing the bright promise of weakly supervised paradigm in crop mapping scenario. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. Code will be available at https://github.com/MiSsU-HH/Exact</p></details> |

For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</p></details> |  |

Data were collected from 81 participants (mean age: 21.5 years, range: 18-61 years, women: 77.8%) whose FA and SC were measured using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). Participants provided demographic and anthropometric data, completed the YFAS, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and wore an actimeter on the non-dominant wrist for a week to record motor activity. Analysis of the actimetric data identified significant statistical and entropy-based features that accurately predicted FA and SC using ML. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was the primary metric. Activity-related features were more effective for FA prediction (MCC=0.88) than rest-related features (MCC=0.68). For SC, activity segments yielded MCC=0.47, rest segments MCC=0.38, and their combination MCC=0.51. Significant correlations were also found between actimetric features related to FA, emotional, and restrained eating behaviors, supporting the model's validity. Our results support the concept of a human bionic suite composed of IoT devices and ML sensors, which implements health digital assistance with real-time monitoring and analysis of physiological indicators related to FA and SC.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

However, tackling time-series analysis tasks usually involves designing and training a separate model from scratch leveraging training data and domain expertise specific to the task. We tackle a significant challenge for pre-training a foundational time-series model from multi-domain time-series datasets: extracting semantically useful tokenized inputs to the model across heterogenous time-series from different domains. We propose Large Pre-trained Time-series Models (LPTM) that introduces a novel method of adaptive segmentation that automatically identifies optimal dataset-specific segmentation strategy during pre-training. This enables LPTM to perform similar to or better than domain-specific state-of-art model when fine-tuned to different downstream time-series analysis tasks and under zero-shot settings. LPTM achieves superior forecasting and time-series classification results taking up to 40% less data and 50% less training time compared to state-of-art baselines.

Although prior works on time-series MLLMs have shown promising performance in time-series forecasting, very few works show how an LLM could be used for time-series reasoning in natural language. We propose a novel multi-modal time-series LLM approach that learns generalizable information across various domains with powerful zero-shot performance. First, we train a lightweight time-series encoder on top of an LLM to directly extract time-series information. Then, we fine-tune our model with chain-of-thought augmented time-series tasks to encourage the model to generate reasoning paths. We show that our model learns a latent representation that reflects specific time-series features (e.g. slope, frequency), as well as outperforming GPT-4o on a set of zero-shot reasoning tasks on a variety of domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral Presentation at 2024 NeurIPS Workshop on Time Series in the Age of Large Models</p></details> |

While foundation models have demonstrated remarkable transfer capabilities across various domains, their effectiveness in handling individual-specific physiological signals - crucial for precision medicine - remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a systematic pipeline for rapidly and efficiently evaluating foundation models' transfer capabilities in medical contexts. Our pipeline employs a three-stage approach. First, it leverages physiological simulation software to generate diverse, clinically relevant scenarios, particularly focusing on data-scarce medical conditions. This simulation-based approach enables both targeted capability assessment and subsequent model fine-tuning. Second, the pipeline projects these simulated signals through the foundation model to obtain embeddings, which are then evaluated using linear methods. This evaluation quantifies the model's ability to capture three critical aspects: physiological feature independence, temporal dynamics preservation, and medical scenario differentiation. Finally, the pipeline validates these representations through specific downstream medical tasks. Initial testing of our pipeline on the Moirai time series foundation model revealed significant limitations in physiological signal processing, including feature entanglement, temporal dynamics distortion, and reduced scenario discrimination. These findings suggest that current foundation models may require substantial architectural modifications or targeted fine-tuning before deployment in clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the precision medicine workshop at the AI in Medicine conference (2024) in Salt Lake City</p></details> |

Despite an abundance of research on NAS for images and natural language applications, similar studies for time series data are lacking. Among NAS search spaces, chain-structured are the simplest and most applicable to small datasets like time series. We compare three popular NAS strategies on chain-structured search spaces: Bayesian optimization (specifically Tree-structured Parzen Estimator), the hyperband method, and reinforcement learning in the context of financial time series forecasting. These strategies were employed to optimize simple well-understood neural architectures like the MLP, 1D CNN, and RNN, with more complex temporal fusion transformers (TFT) and their own optimizers included for comparison. We find Bayesian optimization and the hyperband method performing best among the strategies, and RNN and 1D CNN best among the architectures, but all methods were very close to each other with a high variance due to the difficulty of working with financial datasets. We discuss our approach to overcome the variance and provide implementation recommendations for future users and researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version of the paper published in International Journal of Data Science and Analytics</p></details> |
| **[Advanced Risk Prediction and Stability Assessment of Banks Using Time Series Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03606v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to study the prediction of the bank stability index based on the Time Series Transformer model. The bank stability index is an important indicator to measure the health status and risk resistance of financial institutions. Traditional prediction methods are difficult to adapt to complex market changes because they rely on single-dimensional macroeconomic data. This paper proposes a prediction framework based on the Time Series Transformer, which uses the self-attention mechanism of the model to capture the complex temporal dependencies and nonlinear relationships in financial data. Through experiments, we compare the model with LSTM, GRU, CNN, TCN and RNN-Transformer models. The experimental results show that the Time Series Transformer model outperforms other models in both mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) evaluation indicators, showing strong prediction ability. This shows that the Time Series Transformer model can better handle multidimensional time series data in bank stability prediction, providing new technical approaches and solutions for financial risk management.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatTS: Aligning Time Series with LLMs via Synthetic Data for Enhanced Understanding and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03104v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding time series is crucial for its application in real-world scenarios. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[UTSD: Unified Time Series Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03068v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures have achieved unprecedented success in time series analysis. However, facing the challenge of across-domain modeling, existing studies utilize statistical prior as prompt engineering fails under the huge distribution shift among various domains. In this paper, a Unified Time Series Diffusion (UTSD) model is established for the first time to model the multi-domain probability distribution, utilizing the powerful probability distribution modeling ability of Diffusion. Unlike the autoregressive models that capture the conditional probabilities of the prediction horizon to the historical sequence, we use a diffusion denoising process to model the mixture distribution of the cross-domain data and generate the prediction sequence for the target domain directly utilizing conditional sampling. The proposed UTSD contains three pivotal designs: (1) The condition network captures the multi-scale fluctuation patterns from the observation sequence, which are utilized as context representations to guide the denoising network to generate the prediction sequence; (2) Adapter-based fine-tuning strategy, the multi-domain universal representation learned in the pretraining stage is utilized for downstream tasks in target domains; (3) The diffusion and denoising process on the actual sequence space, combined with the improved classifier free guidance as the conditional generation strategy, greatly improves the stability and accuracy of the downstream task. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks, and the pre-trained UTSD outperforms existing foundation models on all data domains, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization ability. After training from scratch, UTSD achieves comparable performance against domain-specific proprietary models. The empirical results validate the potential of UTSD as a time series foundational model.</p></details> |  |

The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p></details> |  |

We view SCR as providing in their state space feature representations of the input-driving time series. By endowing the state space with the canonical dot-product, we ``reverse engineer" the corresponding kernel (inner product) operating in the original time series space. The action of this time-series kernel is fully characterized by the eigenspace of the corresponding metric tensor. We demonstrate that when linear SCRs are constructed at the edge of stability, the eigenvectors of the time-series kernel align with the Fourier basis. This theoretical insight is supported by numerical experiments.</p></details> | 21 pages |

In this paper, we propose Higher-Order Transformers (HOT), a novel architecture designed to efficiently process data with more than two axes, i.e. higher-order tensors. To address the computational challenges associated with high-order tensor attention, we introduce a novel Kronecker factorized attention mechanism that reduces the attention cost to quadratic in each axis' dimension, rather than quadratic in the total size of the input tensor. To further enhance efficiency, HOT leverages kernelized attention, reducing the complexity to linear. This strategy maintains the model's expressiveness while enabling scalable attention computation. We validate the effectiveness of HOT on two high-dimensional tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, and 3D medical image classification. Experimental results demonstrate that HOT achieves competitive performance while significantly improving computational efficiency, showcasing its potential for tackling a wide range of complex, multi-dimensional data.</p></details> |  |

However, identifying the equations that govern a system's dynamics from experimental data remains a significant challenge without a definitive solution. In this study, evolutionary computing techniques are presented to estimate the governing equations of a dynamical system using time-series data. The main approach is to propose polynomial equations with unknown coefficients, and subsequently perform a parametric estimation using genetic algorithms. Some of the main contributions of the present study are an adequate modification of the genetic algorithm to remove terms with minimal contributions, and a mechanism to escape local optima during the search. To evaluate the proposed method, we applied it to three dynamical systems: a linear model, a nonlinear model, and the Lorenz system. Our results demonstrate a reconstruction with an Integral Square Error below 0.22 and a coefficient of determination R-squared of 0.99 for all systems, indicating successful reconstruction of the governing dynamic equations.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, they often incorporate auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and auxiliary tasks, like predicting user preferences and intent. Despite numerous efforts to enhance these models, they still suffer from limited personalization. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm, which we term preference discerning. In preference dscerning, we explicitly condition a generative sequential recommendation system on user preferences within its context. To this end, we generate user preferences using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on user reviews and item-specific data. To evaluate preference discerning capabilities of sequential recommendation systems, we introduce a novel benchmark that provides a holistic evaluation across various scenarios, including preference steering and sentiment following. We assess current state-of-the-art methods using our benchmark and show that they struggle to accurately discern user preferences. Therefore, we propose a new method named Mender ($\textbf{M}$ultimodal Prefer$\textbf{en}$ce $\textbf{d}$iscern$\textbf{er}$), which improves upon existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark. Our results show that Mender can be effectively guided by human preferences even though they have not been observed during training, paving the way toward more personalized sequential recommendation systems. We will open-source the code and benchmarks upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages + references and appendix</p></details> |

In these domains, maintaining consistency, adhering to regulatory frameworks, minimizing errors, and meeting critical expectations are essential for the reliable functioning of systems. The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights their immense potential, yet there remains considerable scope for improvement in retrieving relevant information and enhancing reasoning capabilities. This study demonstrates that integrating a robust Graph-RAG framework with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought, can significantly enhance performance. Compared to baseline RAG methods and simple prompting strategies, this approach delivers more accurate and context-aware results. While this method demonstrates significant improvements in performance, it comes with challenges. It is both costly and more complex to implement across diverse contexts, requiring careful adaptation to specific scenarios. Additionally, its effectiveness heavily relies on having complete and accurate input data, which may not always be readily available, posing further limitations to its scalability and practicality.</p></details> |  |

While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation. We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.</p></details> |  |

Although ET has proven effective in system-level testing of interactive systems, the need for manual execution has hindered large-scale adoption. In this work, we explore the feasibility, challenges and road ahead of automated scenario-based ET (a.k.a soap opera testing). We conduct a formative study, identifying key insights for effective manual soap opera testing and challenges in automating the process. We then develop a multi-agent system leveraging LLMs and a Scenario Knowledge Graph (SKG) to automate soap opera testing. The system consists of three multi-modal agents, Planner, Player, and Detector that collaborate to execute tests and identify potential bugs. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of automated soap opera testing, but there remains a significant gap compared to manual execution, especially under-explored scenario boundaries and incorrectly identified bugs. Based on the observation, we envision road ahead for the future of automated soap opera testing, focusing on three key aspects: the synergy of neural and symbolic approaches, human-AI co-learning, and the integration of soap opera testing with broader software engineering practices. These insights aim to guide and inspire the future research.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Prompt-based methods are difficult to improve while also being unreliable and costly in both time and money. Our goal is to develop an efficient visual programming system without 1) using prompt-based LLMs at inference time and 2) a large set of program and answer annotations. We develop a synthetic data augmentation approach and alternative program generation method based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills called templates and the corresponding arguments.

Among these, Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT rely on pooling layers to aggregate token-level embeddings into sentence-level representations. Common pooling mechanisms such as Mean, Max, and Weighted Sum play a pivotal role in this aggregation process. Despite their widespread use, the comparative performance of these strategies on different LLM architectures remains underexplored. To address this gap, this paper investigates the effects of these pooling mechanisms on two prominent LLM families -- BERT and GPT, in the context of sentence-level sentiment analysis. Comprehensive experiments reveal that each pooling mechanism exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses depending on the task's specific requirements. Our findings underline the importance of selecting pooling methods tailored to the demands of particular applications, prompting a re-evaluation of common assumptions regarding pooling operations.

However, the absence of benchmarks designed to evaluate these speech interaction capabilities has hindered progress of LLM-based voice assistants development. Current evaluations focus primarily on automatic speech recognition (ASR) or general knowledge evaluation with clean speeches, neglecting the more intricate, real-world scenarios that involve diverse speaker characteristics, environmental and content factors. To address this, we introduce VoiceBench, the first benchmark designed to provide a multi-faceted evaluation of LLM-based voice assistants. VoiceBench also includes both real and synthetic spoken instructions that incorporate the above three key real-world variations. Extensive experiments reveal the limitations of current LLM-based voice assistant models and offer valuable insights for future research and development in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

Although the task is highly valuable, due to the lack of multi-hand grasp datasets with fine-grained contact description between robotic hands and objects, it is still a long-standing difficult task. In this paper, we present Multi-GraspSet, the first large-scale multi-hand grasp dataset with automatically contact annotations. Based on Multi-GraspSet, we propose Multi-GraspLLM, a unified language-guided grasp generation framework. It leverages large language models (LLM) to handle variable-length sequences, generating grasp poses for diverse robotic hands in a single unified architecture. Multi-GraspLLM first aligns the encoded point cloud features and text features into a unified semantic space. It then generates grasp bin tokens which are subsequently converted into grasp pose for each robotic hand via hand-aware linear mapping. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods on Multi-GraspSet.

| **[What Should We Engineer in Prompts? Training Humans in Requirement-Driven LLM Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08775v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs for complex tasks (e.g., building a trip advisor chatbot) needs humans to clearly articulate customized requirements (e.g., "start the response with a tl;dr"). However, existing prompt engineering instructions often lack focused training on requirement articulation and instead tend to emphasize increasingly automatable strategies (e.g., tricks like adding role-plays and "think step-by-step"). To address the gap, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a randomized controlled experiment with 30 novices, ROPE significantly outperforms conventional prompt engineering training (20% vs. 1% gains), a gap that automatic prompt optimization cannot close. Furthermore, we demonstrate a direct correlation between the quality of input requirements and LLM outputs. Our work paves the way to empower more end-users to build complex LLM applications.</p></details> | 15 pages |

While various efforts aim to address this safety concern, previous approaches often demand substantial human data collection or rely on the less dependable option of using another LLM to generate corrective data. In this paper, we aim to take this problem and overcome limitations of requiring significant high-quality human data. Our method requires only a small set of unsafe responses to toxic prompts, easily obtained from the unsafe LLM itself. By employing a semantic cost combined with a negative Earth Mover Distance (EMD) loss, we guide the LLM away from generating unsafe responses. Additionally, we propose a novel lower bound for EMD loss, enabling more efficient optimization. Our results demonstrate superior performance and data efficiency compared to baselines, and we further examine the nuanced effects of over-alignment and potential degradation of language capabilities when using contrastive data.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecRover: Code Intent Extraction via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02232v4)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous program improvement typically involves automatically producing bug fixes and feature additions. Such program improvement can be accomplished by a combination of large language model (LLM) and program analysis capabilities, in the form of an LLM agent. Since program repair or program improvement typically requires a specification of intended behavior - specification inference can be useful for producing high quality program patches. In this work, we examine efficient and low-cost workflows for iterative specification inference within an LLM agent. Given a GitHub issue to be resolved in a software project, our goal is to conduct iterative code search accompanied by specification inference - thereby inferring intent from both the project structure and behavior. The intent thus captured is examined by a reviewer agent with the goal of vetting the patches as well as providing a measure of confidence in the vetted patches. Our approach SpecRover (AutoCodeRover-v2) is built on the open-source LLM agent AutoCodeRover. In an evaluation on the full SWE-Bench consisting of 2294 GitHub issues, it shows more than 50% improvement in efficacy over AutoCodeRover. Compared to the open-source agents available, our work shows modest cost ($0.65 per issue) in resolving an average GitHub issue in SWE-Bench lite. The production of explanation by SpecRover allows for a better "signal" to be given to the developer, on when the suggested patches can be accepted with confidence. SpecRover also seeks to demonstrate the continued importance of specification inference in automated program repair, even as program repair technologies enter the LLM era.</p></details> | <details><summary>Haife...</summary><p>Haifeng Ruan and Yuntong Zhang contributed equally to this work.

This taxonomy-based survey provides a comprehensive analysis of LLMs in the NL-PL domain, investigating how these models are utilized in coding tasks and examining their methodologies, architectures, and training processes.

As LLMs perform more complicated reasoning through longer interactions, self-consistency, i.e., the idea that the answer obtained from sampling and marginalising a number of multiple independent inferences is more likely to be correct, has received much attention as a simple validation technique. This paper aims to empirically verify this intuitive hypothesis by predicting the correctness of answers obtained using self-consistency from properties of the samples of reasoning paths. We introduce Lachesis, a predictive model for self-consistency based LLM inferences, and empirically evaluate it using AutoFL, a recently proposed LLM-based fault localisation technique, as the target technique that uses self-consistency. Lachesis converts collected reasoning paths from AutoFL using specifically designed reasoning path representations, and trains LSTM and GCN models to predict whether a given set of reasoning paths would result in a correct answer. The results suggest that Lachesis can predict the correctness of answers with a precision of up to 0.8136, highlighting the possibility of training a predictive model that can allow early termination of inferences that are not likely to be successful.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at DeepTest 2025</p></details> |

This imbalance results in LLMs performing significantly better on high-resource languages like English, German, and French, while their capabilities in low-resource languages remain inadequate. Currently, there is a lack of quantitative methods to evaluate the performance of LLMs in these low-resource languages. To address this gap, we propose the Language Ranker, an intrinsic metric designed to benchmark and rank languages based on LLM performance using internal representations. By comparing the LLM's internal representation of various languages against a baseline derived from English, we can assess the model's multilingual capabilities in a robust and language-agnostic manner. Our analysis reveals that high-resource languages exhibit higher similarity scores with English, demonstrating superior performance, while low-resource languages show lower similarity scores, underscoring the effectiveness of our metric in assessing language-specific capabilities. Besides, the experiments show that there is a strong correlation between the LLM's performance in different languages and the proportion of those languages in its pre-training corpus. These insights underscore the efficacy of the Language Ranker as a tool for evaluating LLM performance across different languages, particularly those with limited resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025 (Social Impact Track)</p></details> |

Traditional generation of these reports requires extensive financial expertise and is time-consuming. With the impressive progress in Large Language Models (LLMs), a wide variety of financially focused LLMs has emerged, addressing tasks like sentiment analysis and entity recognition in the financial domain. This paper presents a novel challenge: developing an LLM specifically for automating the generation of earnings reports analysis. Our methodology involves an in-depth analysis of existing earnings reports followed by a unique approach to fine-tune an LLM for this purpose. This approach combines retrieval augmentation and the generation of instruction-based data, specifically tailored for the financial sector, to enhance the LLM's performance. With extensive financial documents, we construct financial instruction data, enabling the refined adaptation of our LLM to financial contexts. Preliminary results indicate that our augmented LLM outperforms general open-source models and rivals commercial counterparts like GPT-3.5 in financial applications. Our research paves the way for streamlined and insightful automation in financial report generation, marking a significant stride in the field of financial analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs excel in program synthesis, their direct application to ARC yields limited success. To address this, we introduce ConceptSearch, a novel function-search algorithm that leverages LLMs for program generation and employs a concept-based scoring method to guide the search efficiently. Unlike simplistic pixel-based metrics like Hamming distance, ConceptSearch evaluates programs on their ability to capture the underlying transformation concept reflected in the input-output examples. We explore three scoring functions: Hamming distance, a CNN-based scoring function, and an LLM-based natural language scoring function. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ConceptSearch, achieving a significant performance improvement over direct prompting with GPT-4. Moreover, our novel concept-based scoring exhibits up to 30% greater efficiency compared to Hamming distance, measured in terms of the number of iterations required to reach the correct solution. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven program search when integrated with concept-based guidance for tackling challenging generalization problems like ARC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print of paper accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, there are still gaps before they can be fully applied in actual software development processes. Accurately assessing the code generation capabilities of large language models has become an important basis for evaluating and improving the models. Some existing works have constructed datasets to evaluate the capabilities of these models. However, the current evaluation process may encounter the illusion of "Specialist in Familiarity", primarily due to three gaps: the exposure of target code, case timeliness, and dependency availability. The fundamental reason for these gaps is that the code in current datasets may have been extensively exposed and exercised during the training phase, and due to the continuous training and development of LLM, their timeliness has been severely compromised. The key to solve the problem is to, as much as possible, evaluate the LLMs using code that they have not encountered before. Thus, the fundamental idea in this paper is to draw on the concept of code obfuscation, changing code at different levels while ensuring the functionality and output. To this end, we build a code-obfuscation based benchmark OBFUSEVAL. We first collect 1,354 raw cases from five real-world projects, including function description and code. Then we use three-level strategy (symbol, structure and semantic) to obfuscate descriptions, code and context dependencies. We evaluate four LLMs on OBFU- SEVAL and compared the effectiveness of different obfuscation strategy. We use official test suites of these projects to evaluate the generated code. The results show that after obfuscation, the average decrease ratio of test pass rate can up to 62.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Large...</summary><p>Large Language Model,Code Generation Capability,Code Dataset</p></details> |

Recent strides in cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL), mainly through semantically aligned examples retrieved from multilingual pre-trained transformers, have shown promise in mitigating this issue. However, our investigation reveals that LLMs intrinsically reward in-language semantically aligned cross-lingual instances over direct cross-lingual semantic alignments, with a pronounced disparity in handling time-sensitive queries in the X-ICL setup. Such queries demand sound temporal reasoning ability from LLMs, yet the advancements have predominantly focused on English. This study aims to bridge this gap by improving temporal reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages. To this end, we introduce mTEMPREASON a temporal reasoning dataset aimed at the varied degrees of low-resource languages and propose Cross-Lingual Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment (CLiTSSA), a novel method to improve temporal reasoning in these contexts. To facilitate this, we construct an extension of mTEMPREASON comprising pairs of parallel cross-language temporal queries along with their anticipated in-language semantic similarity scores. Our empirical evidence underscores the superior performance of CLiTSSA compared to established baselines across three languages - Romanian, German, and French, encompassing three temporal tasks and including a diverse set of four contemporaneous LLMs. This marks a significant step forward in addressing resource disparity in the context of temporal reasoning across languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08054v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent services by enabling logical reasoning, tool use, and interaction with external systems as agents. The advancement of LLMs is frequently hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data, much of which is inherently sensitive. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by facilitating the collaborative training of distributed LLMs while safeguarding private data. However, FL frameworks face significant bandwidth and computational demands, along with challenges from heterogeneous data distributions. The emerging in-context learning capability of LLMs offers a promising approach by aggregating natural language rather than bulky model parameters. Yet, this method risks privacy leakage, as it necessitates the collection and presentation of data samples from various clients during aggregation. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning (FICAL) algorithm, which to our best knowledge for the first work unleashes the power of in-context learning to train diverse LLM agents through FL. In our design, knowledge compendiums generated by a novel LLM-enhanced Knowledge Compendiums Generation (KCG) module are transmitted between clients and the server instead of model parameters in previous FL methods. Apart from that, an incredible Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Tool Learning and Utilizing (TLU) module is designed and we incorporate the aggregated global knowledge compendium as a teacher to teach LLM agents the usage of tools. We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that FICAL has competitive performance compared to other SOTA baselines with a significant communication cost decrease of $\mathbf{3.33\times10^5}$ times.</p></details> |  |

However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world backgrounds and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality. Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch-generation problem. Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments. The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate placement within the scene. We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges. MAGIC automatically understands scene context and orchestrates adversarial patch generation through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities. MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal placement strategies based on scene understanding. The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes. We validate our method on both digital and physical level, \ie, nuImage and manually captured real scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effectively for attacking wide-used object detection systems.</p></details> |  |

By allocating more computational resources during the inference phase, large language models~(LLMs) can extensively explore the solution space by generating more thought tokens or diverse solutions, thereby producing more accurate responses. However, developing an o1-like reasoning approach is challenging, and researchers have been making various attempts to advance this open area of research. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration into enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs through reward-guided tree search algorithms. This framework is implemented by integrating the policy model, reward model, and search algorithm. It is primarily constructed around a tree search algorithm, where the policy model navigates a dynamically expanding tree guided by a specially trained reward model. We thoroughly explore various design considerations necessary for implementing this framework and provide a detailed report of the technical aspects.

In this paper, we introduce LLaSA (Large Language and Sensor Assistant), a multimodal large language model built on LIMU-BERT and Llama, designed to interpret and answer queries related to human activities and motion analysis, leveraging sensor data and contextual reasoning. To develop LLaSA, we introduce two key datasets: SensorCaps, a comprehensive collection of 35,960 IMU-derived narratives with handcrafted features, and OpenSQA, an instruction-following dataset containing 179,727 question-answer pairs aware of the sensor and human activity context. These datasets provide diverse and rich inputs to train LLaSA for complex sensor-based queries. To optimize LLaSA's performance, we apply a unique hyperparameter tuning method, which significantly enhances its effectiveness in contextual question-answering tasks. Extensive evaluations, including a human-led assessment of the question-answering, demonstrate that LLaSA achieves superior data interpretation and context-aware responses compared to GPT-3.5-Turbo and Vicuna-1.5-13b-16K. These contributions advance the frontier of sensor-aware LLMs and create new opportunities for impactful multimodal research in healthcare, sports science, and human-computer interactions.

To test this, we evaluate ChatGPT's performance on a large sample of two reading comprehension datasets under both open-book and closed-book settings, varying the repetition of each question to 1, 3, or 5 times per prompt. Our findings indicate that the model does not demonstrate sensitivity to repeated questions, highlighting its robustness and consistency in this context.</p></details> |  |

Existing works have studied how to make LLMs follow tutoring principles, but have not studied broader uses of LLMs for supporting tutoring. Up until now, tracing student knowledge and analyzing misconceptions has been difficult and time-consuming to implement for open-ended dialogue tutoring. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be supportive of this task: we first use LLM prompting methods to identify the knowledge components/skills involved in each dialogue turn, i.e., a tutor utterance posing a task or a student utterance that responds to it. We also evaluate whether the student responds correctly to the tutor and verify the LLM's accuracy using human expert annotations. We then apply a range of knowledge tracing (KT) methods on the resulting labeled data to track student knowledge levels over an entire dialogue. We conduct experiments on two tutoring dialogue datasets, and show that a novel yet simple LLM-based method, LLMKT, significantly outperforms existing KT methods in predicting student response correctness in dialogues. We perform extensive qualitative analyses to highlight the challenges in dialogueKT and outline multiple avenues for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in LAK 2025: The 15th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference</p></details> |

This paper presents a thorough exposition of how and why people perform such attacks, defining LLM red-teaming based on extensive and diverse evidence. Using a formal qualitative methodology, we interviewed dozens of practitioners from a broad range of backgrounds, all contributors to this novel work of attempting to cause LLMs to fail. We focused on the research questions of defining LLM red teaming, uncovering the motivations and goals for performing the activity, and characterizing the strategies people use when attacking LLMs. Based on the data, LLM red teaming is defined as a limit-seeking, non-malicious, manual activity, which depends highly on a team-effort and an alchemist mindset. It is highly intrinsically motivated by curiosity, fun, and to some degrees by concerns for various harms of deploying LLMs. We identify a taxonomy of 12 strategies and 35 different techniques of attacking LLMs. These findings are presented as a comprehensive grounded theory of how and why people attack large language models: LLM red teaming.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a new low-rank approach to correct for quantization errors of \emph{activations} in LLMs: we propose to add low-rank weight matrices in full precision that act on the \emph{unquantized} activations. We then solve a joint optimization problem over the quantized representation of the weights and additional low-rank weight matrices to quantize both weights and activations. We focus on the case of 4-bit weight-and-activation quantization (W4A4). Using ranks equivalent to 10\% of the original weight matrix size, our approach reduces the accuracy gap with the original model by more than 50\%. Using ranks equivalent to 30\% of the original weight matrix, the accuracy gap is closed completely. We demonstrate our results on four recent LLMs, namely Llama-2, Llama-3, Phi-3 and Mixtral models.</p></details> |  |

Recent work proposed advanced prompting techniques and the necessity of fine-tuning with high-quality data to augment LLMs' reasoning abilities. However, these approaches are inherently constrained by data availability and quality. In light of this, self-correction and self-learning emerge as viable solutions, employing strategies that allow LLMs to refine their outputs and learn from self-assessed rewards. Yet, the efficacy of LLMs in self-refining its response, particularly in complex reasoning and planning task, remains dubious. In this paper, we introduce AlphaLLM for the self-improvements of LLMs, which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with LLMs to establish a self-improving loop, thereby enhancing the capabilities of LLMs without additional annotations. Drawing inspiration from the success of AlphaGo, AlphaLLM addresses the unique challenges of combining MCTS with LLM for self-improvement, including data scarcity, the vastness search spaces of language tasks, and the subjective nature of feedback in language tasks. AlphaLLM is comprised of prompt synthesis component, an efficient MCTS approach tailored for language tasks, and a trio of critic models for precise feedback. Our experimental results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that AlphaLLM significantly enhances the performance of LLMs without additional annotations, showing the potential for self-improvement in LLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[FlexLLM: Exploring LLM Customization for Moving Target Defense on Black-Box LLMs Against Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07672v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defense in large language models (LLMs) is crucial to counter the numerous attackers exploiting these systems to generate harmful content through manipulated prompts, known as jailbreak attacks. Although many defense strategies have been proposed, they often require access to the model's internal structure or need additional training, which is impractical for service providers using LLM APIs, such as OpenAI APIs or Claude APIs. In this paper, we propose a moving target defense approach that alters decoding hyperparameters to enhance model robustness against various jailbreak attacks. Our approach does not require access to the model's internal structure and incurs no additional training costs. The proposed defense includes two key components: (1) optimizing the decoding strategy by identifying and adjusting decoding hyperparameters that influence token generation probabilities, and (2) transforming the decoding hyperparameters and model system prompts into dynamic targets, which are continuously altered during each runtime. By continuously modifying decoding strategies and prompts, the defense effectively mitigates the existing attacks. Our results demonstrate that our defense is the most effective against jailbreak attacks in three of the models tested when using LLMs as black-box APIs. Moreover, our defense offers lower inference costs and maintains comparable response quality, making it a potential layer of protection when used alongside other defense methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrojanWhisper: Evaluating Pre-trained LLMs to Detect and Localize Hardware Trojans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07636v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Hardware Trojans (HT) detection methods face several critical limitations: logic testing struggles with scalability and coverage for large designs, side-channel analysis requires golden reference chips, and formal verification methods suffer from state-space explosion. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising new direction for HT detection by leveraging their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. For the first time, this paper explores the potential of general-purpose LLMs in detecting various HTs inserted in Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs, including SRAM, AES, and UART modules. We propose a novel tool for this goal that systematically assesses state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 pro, and Llama 3.1) in detecting HTs without prior fine-tuning. To address potential training data bias, the tool implements perturbation techniques, i.e., variable name obfuscation, and design restructuring, that make the cases more sophisticated for the used LLMs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates perfect detection rates by GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 pro in baseline scenarios (100%/100% precision/recall), with both models achieving better trigger line coverage (TLC: 0.82-0.98) than payload line coverage (PLC: 0.32-0.46). Under code perturbation, while Gemini 1.5 pro maintains perfect detection performance (100%/100%), GPT-4o (100%/85.7%) and Llama 3.1 (66.7%/85.7%) show some degradation in detection rates, and all models experience decreased accuracy in localizing both triggers and payloads. This paper validates the potential of LLM approaches for hardware security applications, highlighting areas for future improvement.</p></details> |  |

A Detailed Analysis of Potential Factors Contributing to Difficulties in LLM Text Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14875v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs increase in accessibility, LLM-generated texts have proliferated across several fields, such as scientific, academic, and creative writing. However, LLMs are not created equally; they may have different architectures and training datasets. Thus, some LLMs may be more challenging to detect than others. Using two datasets spanning four total writing domains, we train AI-generated (AIG) text classifiers using the LibAUC library - a deep learning library for training classifiers with imbalanced datasets. Our results in the Deepfake Text dataset show that AIG-text detection varies across domains, with scientific writing being relatively challenging. In the Rewritten Ivy Panda (RIP) dataset focusing on student essays, we find that the OpenAI family of LLMs was substantially difficult for our classifiers to distinguish from human texts. Additionally, we explore possible factors that could explain the difficulties in detecting OpenAI-generated texts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024 - Safe Generative AI Workshop; Camera-ready version</p></details> |

Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, are transforming task planning by offering natural language as an intuitive and flexible way to describe tasks, generate symbolic plans, and reason. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based TAMP approaches is limited due to static and template-based prompting, which struggles in adapting to dynamic environments and complex task contexts. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel ontology-driven prompt-tuning framework that employs knowledge-based reasoning to refine and expand user prompts with task contextual reasoning and knowledge-based environment state descriptions. Integrating domain-specific knowledge into the prompt ensures semantically accurate and context-aware task plans. The proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness by resolving semantic errors in symbolic plan generation, such as maintaining logical temporal goal ordering in scenarios involving hierarchical object placement. The proposed framework is validated through both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over the baseline approach in terms of adaptability to dynamic environments, and the generation of semantically correct task plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Ensemble Reasoning for LLM Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07448v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensemble reasoning for the strengths of different LLM experts is critical to achieving consistent and satisfactory performance on diverse inputs across a wide range of tasks. However, existing LLM ensemble methods are either computationally intensive or incapable of leveraging complementary knowledge among LLM experts for various inputs. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Ensemble Reasoning paradigm, called DER to integrate the strengths of multiple LLM experts conditioned on dynamic inputs. Specifically, we model the LLM ensemble reasoning problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), wherein an agent sequentially takes inputs to request knowledge from an LLM candidate and passes the output to a subsequent LLM candidate. Moreover, we devise a reward function to train a DER-Agent to dynamically select an optimal answering route given the input questions, aiming to achieve the highest performance with as few computational resources as possible. Last, to fully transfer the expert knowledge from the prior LLMs, we develop a Knowledge Transfer Prompt (KTP) that enables the subsequent LLM candidates to transfer complementary knowledge effectively. Experiments demonstrate that our method uses fewer computational resources to achieve better performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We evaluated 7 English and 12 Chinese-oriented LLMs on CHARM, employing 5 representative prompt strategies for improving LLMs' reasoning ability, such as Chain-of-Thought. Our findings indicate that the LLM's language orientation and the task's domain influence the effectiveness of the prompt strategy, which enriches previous research findings. We built closely-interconnected reasoning and memorization tasks, and found that some LLMs struggle with memorizing Chinese commonsense, affecting their reasoning ability, while others show differences in reasoning despite similar memorization performance. We also evaluated the LLMs' memorization-independent reasoning abilities and analyzed the typical errors. Our study precisely identified the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses, providing the clear direction for optimization. It can also serve as a reference for studies in other fields.

We present the Frame Representation Hypothesis, a theoretically robust framework grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) to interpret and control LLMs by modeling multi-token words. Prior research explored LRH to connect LLM representations with linguistic concepts, but was limited to single token analysis. As most words are composed of several tokens, we extend LRH to multi-token words, thereby enabling usage on any textual data with thousands of concepts. To this end, we propose words can be interpreted as frames, ordered sequences of vectors that better capture token-word relationships. Then, concepts can be represented as the average of word frames sharing a common concept. We showcase these tools through Top-k Concept-Guided Decoding, which can intuitively steer text generation using concepts of choice. We verify said ideas on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and Phi 3 families, demonstrating gender and language biases, exposing harmful content, but also potential to remediate them, leading to safer and more transparent LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/phvv-me/frame-representation-hypothesis.git</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a system that generates LLM personas to debate a topic of interest from different perspectives. How might information seekers use and benefit from such a system? Can centering information access around diverse viewpoints help to mitigate thorny challenges like confirmation bias in which information seekers over-trust search results matching existing beliefs? How do potential biases and hallucinations in LLMs play out alongside human users who are also fallible and possibly biased? Our study exposes participants to multiple viewpoints on controversial issues via a mixed-methods, within-subjects study. We use eye-tracking metrics to quantitatively assess cognitive engagement alongside qualitative feedback. Compared to a baseline search system, we see more creative interactions and diverse information-seeking with our multi-persona debate system, which more effectively reduces user confirmation bias and conviction toward their initial beliefs. Overall, our study contributes to the emerging design space of LLM-based information access systems, specifically investigating the potential of simulated personas to promote greater exposure to information diversity, emulate collective intelligence, and mitigate bias in information seeking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Bias in LLM-Based Bias Detection: Disparities between LLMs and Human Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14896v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pervasive spread of misinformation and disinformation in social media underscores the critical importance of detecting media bias. While robust Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as foundational tools for bias prediction, concerns about inherent biases within these models persist. In this work, we investigate the presence and nature of bias within LLMs and its consequential impact on media bias detection. Departing from conventional approaches that focus solely on bias detection in media content, we delve into biases within the LLM systems themselves. Through meticulous examination, we probe whether LLMs exhibit biases, particularly in political bias prediction and text continuation tasks. Additionally, we explore bias across diverse topics, aiming to uncover nuanced variations in bias expression within the LLM framework. Importantly, we propose debiasing strategies, including prompt engineering and model fine-tuning. Extensive analysis of bias tendencies across different LLMs sheds light on the broader landscape of bias propagation in language models. This study advances our understanding of LLM bias, offering critical insights into its implications for bias detection tasks and paving the way for more robust and equitable AI systems</p></details> | COLING 2025 |
| **[MemHunter: Automated and Verifiable Memorization Detection at Dataset-scale in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07261v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to memorize and reproduce content from their training data, raising significant privacy concerns, especially with web-scale datasets. Existing methods for detecting memorization are largely sample-specific, relying on manually crafted or discretely optimized memory-inducing prompts generated on a per-sample basis, which become impractical for dataset-level detection due to the prohibitive computational cost of iterating over all samples. In real-world scenarios, data owners may need to verify whether a susceptible LLM has memorized their dataset, particularly if the LLM may have collected the data from the web without authorization. To address this, we introduce \textit{MemHunter}, which trains a memory-inducing LLM and employs hypothesis testing to efficiently detect memorization at the dataset level, without requiring sample-specific memory inducing. Experiments on models such as Pythia and Llama-2 demonstrate that \textit{MemHunter} can extract up to 40\% more training data than existing methods under constrained time resources and reduce search time by up to 80\% when integrated as a plug-in. Crucially, \textit{MemHunter} is the first method capable of dataset-level memorization detection, providing an indispensable tool for assessing privacy risks in LLMs that are powered by vast web-sourced datasets.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies mitigate this challenge by replaying historical data or employing parameter-efficient tuning (PET), but they often violate data privacy or rely on ideal continual learning settings. To address these problems, we propose a new Large Language Model (LLM)-Enhanced Continuous Semantic Parsing method, named LECSP, which alleviates forgetting while encouraging generalization, without requiring real data replay or ideal settings. Specifically, it first analyzes the commonalities and differences between tasks from the SQL syntax perspective to guide LLMs in reconstructing key memories and improving memory accuracy through a calibration strategy. Then, it uses a task-aware dual-teacher distillation framework to promote the accumulation and transfer of knowledge during sequential training. Experimental results on two CSP benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods, even those utilizing data replay or ideal settings. Additionally, we achieve generalization performance beyond the upper limits, better adapting to unseen tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Filtration in RLHF to Fine-Tune LLM for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06957v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is one of the key techniques that helps large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions and provide helpful and harmless responses. While direct policy optimization methods exist, state-of-the-art LLMs adopt RL-based methods (usually PPO) in RLHF to train the policy to generate good responses guided by a reward model learned from preference data. The main challenge of these methods is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in code generation tasks that require long and complex reasoning to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtration strategy for a given reward model, the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) between rewards and actual scores on filtered samples serves as a good metrics and helps us find several promising strategies. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation tasks, and find that some variants of PF-PPO are highly effective and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval, MBPP, and a new and more challenging LeetCode Contest benchmark.</p></details> |  |

One of the most promising applications is their role as evaluators based on natural language responses, referred to as ''LLMs-as-judges''. This framework has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry due to their excellent effectiveness, ability to generalize across tasks, and interpretability in the form of natural language. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the LLMs-as-judges paradigm from five key perspectives: Functionality, Methodology, Applications, Meta-evaluation, and Limitations.

However, traditional methods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging subtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where LLMs are leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks and applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based judgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging field. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output perspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore LLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to judge.

Our work addresses this challenge by presenting OntoKGen, a genuine pipeline for ontology extraction and Knowledge Graph (KG) generation. OntoKGen leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) through an interactive user interface guided by our adaptive iterative Chain of Thought (CoT) algorithm to ensure that the ontology extraction process and, thus, KG generation align with user-specific requirements. Although KG generation follows a clear, structured path based on the confirmed ontology, there is no universally correct ontology as it is inherently based on the user's preferences. OntoKGen recommends an ontology grounded in best practices, minimizing user effort and providing valuable insights that may have been overlooked, all while giving the user complete control over the final ontology. Having generated the KG based on the confirmed ontology, OntoKGen enables seamless integration into schemeless, non-relational databases like Neo4j. This integration allows for flexible storage and retrieval of knowledge from diverse, unstructured sources, facilitating advanced querying, analysis, and decision-making. Moreover, the generated KG serves as a robust foundation for future integration into Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering enhanced capabilities for developing domain-specific intelligent applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we investigate sparse fine-tuning and observe a remarkable improvement in generalization ability. Utilizing this key insight, we propose a family of Structured Sparse Fine-Tuning (S$^{2}$FT) methods for LLMs, which concurrently achieve state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance, training efficiency, and inference scalability. S$^{2}$FT accomplishes this by "selecting sparsely and computing densely". It selects a few heads and channels in the MHA and FFN modules for each Transformer block, respectively. Next, it co-permutes weight matrices on both sides of the coupled structures in LLMs to connect the selected components in each layer into a dense submatrix. Finally, S$^{2}$FT performs in-place gradient updates on all submatrices. Through theoretical analysis and empirical results, our method prevents overfitting and forgetting, delivers SOTA performance on both commonsense and arithmetic reasoning with 4.6% and 1.3% average improvements compared to LoRA, and surpasses full FT by 11.5% when generalizing to various domains after instruction tuning. Using our partial backpropagation algorithm, S$^{2}$FT saves training memory up to 3$\times$ and improves latency by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to full FT, while delivering an average 10% improvement over LoRA on both metrics. We further demonstrate that the weight updates in S$^{2}$FT can be decoupled into adapters, enabling effective fusion, fast switch, and efficient parallelism for serving multiple fine-tuned models.</p></details> |  |

Network pruning, which targets unstructured or structured sparsity by removing redundant parameters, has recently been explored for LLM acceleration. Existing LLM pruning works focus on unstructured pruning, which typically requires special hardware support for a practical speed-up. In contrast, structured pruning can reduce latency on general devices. However, it remains a challenge to perform structured pruning efficiently and maintain performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. To this end, we introduce an efficient structured pruning framework named CFSP, which leverages both Coarse (interblock) and Fine-grained (intrablock) activation information as an importance criterion to guide pruning. The pruning is highly efficient, as it only requires one forward pass to compute feature activations. Specifically, we first allocate the sparsity budget across blocks based on their importance and then retain important weights within each block. In addition, we introduce a recovery fine-tuning strategy that adaptively allocates training overhead based on coarse-grained importance to further improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CFSP outperforms existing methods on diverse models across various sparsity budgets. Our code will be available at https://github.com/wyxscir/CFSP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proc....</summary><p>Proc.

However, the mechanisms underlying this proficiency remain underexplored, particularly with respect to whether distinct programming languages are processed independently or within a shared parametric region. Drawing an analogy to the specialized regions of the brain responsible for distinct cognitive functions, we introduce the concept of Coding Spot, a specialized parametric region within LLMs that facilitates coding capabilities. Our findings identify this Coding Spot and show that targeted modifications to this subset significantly affect performance on coding tasks, while largely preserving non-coding functionalities. This compartmentalization mirrors the functional specialization observed in cognitive neuroscience, where specific brain regions are dedicated to distinct tasks, suggesting that LLMs may similarly employ specialized parameter regions for different knowledge domains.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a method that predicts emergent abilities by leveraging proxy tasks. We begin by establishing relevance metrics between the target task and candidate tasks based on performance differences across multiple models. These candidate tasks are then validated for robustness with small model ensembles, leading to the selection of the most appropriate proxy tasks. The predicted performance on the target task is then derived by integrating the evaluation results of these proxies. In a case study on tool utilization capabilities, our method demonstrated a strong correlation between predicted and actual performance, confirming its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Evaluating the Durability of Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07097v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stakeholders -- from model developers to policymakers -- seek to minimize the dual-use risks of large language models (LLMs). An open challenge to this goal is whether technical safeguards can impede the misuse of LLMs, even when models are customizable via fine-tuning or when model weights are fully open. In response, several recent studies have proposed methods to produce durable LLM safeguards for open-weight LLMs that can withstand adversarial modifications of the model's weights via fine-tuning. This holds the promise of raising adversaries' costs even under strong threat models where adversaries can directly fine-tune model weights. However, in this paper, we urge for more careful characterization of the limits of these approaches. Through several case studies, we demonstrate that even evaluating these defenses is exceedingly difficult and can easily mislead audiences into thinking that safeguards are more durable than they really are. We draw lessons from the evaluation pitfalls that we identify and suggest future research carefully cabin claims to more constrained, well-defined, and rigorously examined threat models, which can provide more useful and candid assessments to stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

Despite initial promise, neural-based methods for automated test oracle generation often result in a large number of false positives and weaker test oracles. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive effectiveness in various software engineering tasks, including code generation, test case creation, and bug fixing, there remains a notable absence of large-scale studies exploring their effectiveness in test oracle generation. The question of whether LLMs can address the challenges in effective oracle generation is both compelling and requires thorough investigation. In this research, we present the first comprehensive study to investigate the capabilities of LLMs in generating correct, diverse, and strong test oracles capable of effectively identifying a large number of unique bugs. To this end, we fine-tuned seven code LLMs using six distinct prompts on the SF110 dataset. Utilizing the most effective fine-tuned LLM and prompt pair, we introduce TOGLL, a novel LLM-based method for test oracle generation. To investigate the generalizability of TOGLL, we conduct studies on 25 large-scale Java projects. Besides assessing the correctness, we also assess the diversity and strength of the generated oracles. We compare the results against EvoSuite and the state-of-the-art neural method, TOGA. Our findings reveal that TOGLL can produce 3.8 times more correct assertion oracles and 4.9 times more exception oracles. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that TOGLL is capable of generating significantly diverse test oracles. It can detect 1,023 unique bugs that EvoSuite cannot, which is ten times more than what the previous SOTA neural-based method, TOGA, can detect.</p></details> |  |

However, the current approach to LLM function calling is inherently synchronous, where each call blocks LLM inference, limiting LLM operation and concurrent function execution. In this work, we propose AsyncLM, a system for asynchronous LLM function calling. AsyncLM improves LLM's operational efficiency by enabling LLMs to generate and execute function calls concurrently. Instead of waiting for each call's completion, AsyncLM introduces an interrupt mechanism to asynchronously notify the LLM in-flight when function calls return. We design an in-context protocol for function calls and interrupts, provide fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to the interrupt semantics, and implement these mechanisms efficiently on LLM inference process. We demonstrate that AsyncLM can reduce end-to-end task completion latency from 1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous function calling on a set of benchmark tasks in the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL). Furthermore, we discuss how interrupt mechanisms can be extended to enable novel human-LLM or LLM-LLM interactions.</p></details> |  |

Prompting LLM with audio embeddings to generate transcriptions becomes the new state-of-the-art ASR. Despite LLMs being trained with an extensive amount of text corpora, high-quality domain-specific text data can still significantly enhance ASR performance on domain adaptation tasks. Although LLM-based ASR can naturally incorporate more text corpora by fine-tuning the LLM decoder, fine-tuning such ASR on text-only data without paired prompts may diminish the effectiveness of domain-specific knowledge. To mitigate this issue, we propose a two-step soft prompt fine-tuning strategy that enhances domain-specific text adaptation. Experimental results show that text adaptation with our proposed method achieved a relative up to 9% Word Error Rate (WER) reduction and up to 18% Entity Error Rate (EER) reduction on the target domain compared to the baseline ASR. Combining this with domain-specific Language Model (LM) fusion can further improve the EER by a relative 2-5%</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as SLT 2024 proceeding</p></details> |
| **[WildGuard: Open One-Stop Moderation Tools for Safety Risks, Jailbreaks, and Refusals of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18495v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WildGuard -- an open, light-weight moderation tool for LLM safety that achieves three goals: (1) identifying malicious intent in user prompts, (2) detecting safety risks of model responses, and (3) determining model refusal rate. Together, WildGuard serves the increasing needs for automatic safety moderation and evaluation of LLM interactions, providing a one-stop tool with enhanced accuracy and broad coverage across 13 risk categories. While existing open moderation tools such as Llama-Guard2 score reasonably well in classifying straightforward model interactions, they lag far behind a prompted GPT-4, especially in identifying adversarial jailbreaks and in evaluating models' refusals, a key measure for evaluating safety behaviors in model responses. To address these challenges, we construct WildGuardMix, a large-scale and carefully balanced multi-task safety moderation dataset with 92K labeled examples that cover vanilla (direct) prompts and adversarial jailbreaks, paired with various refusal and compliance responses. WildGuardMix is a combination of WildGuardTrain, the training data of WildGuard, and WildGuardTest, a high-quality human-annotated moderation test set with 5K labeled items covering broad risk scenarios. Through extensive evaluations on WildGuardTest and ten existing public benchmarks, we show that WildGuard establishes state-of-the-art performance in open-source safety moderation across all the three tasks compared to ten strong existing open-source moderation models (e.g., up to 26.4% improvement on refusal detection). Importantly, WildGuard matches and sometimes exceeds GPT-4 performance (e.g., up to 3.9% improvement on prompt harmfulness identification). WildGuard serves as a highly effective safety moderator in an LLM interface, reducing the success rate of jailbreak attacks from 79.8% to 2.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Camera Ready.

Yet, robotic systems still fall short of matching biological dexterity. In this paper, we investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), tool affordances, and object manoeuvrability for non-prehensile tool-based manipulation tasks. Our novel method leverages LLMs based on scene information and natural language instructions to enable symbolic task planning for tool-object manipulation. This approach allows the system to convert the human language sentence into a sequence of feasible motion functions. We have developed a novel manoeuvrability-driven controller using a new tool affordance model derived from visual feedback. This controller helps guide the robot's tool utilization and manipulation actions, even within confined areas, using a stepping incremental approach. The proposed methodology is evaluated with experiments to prove its effectiveness under various manipulation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, conventional methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen goals and states, thereby limiting their practical applicability. This paper presents TEDUO, a novel training pipeline for offline language-conditioned policy learning. TEDUO operates on easy-to-obtain, unlabeled datasets and is suited for the so-called in-the-wild evaluation, wherein the agent encounters previously unseen goals and states. To address the challenges posed by such data and evaluation settings, our method leverages the prior knowledge and instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the fidelity of pre-collected offline data and enable flexible generalization to new goals and states. Empirical results demonstrate that the dual role of LLMs in our framework-as data enhancers and generalizers-facilitates both effective and data-efficient learning of generalizable language-conditioned policies.</p></details> |  |

This poses a challenge for users who wish to reuse or analyze these snippets. Existing methods either do not focus on creating compilable code or have low success rates. To address this, we propose ZS4C, a lightweight approach for zero-shot synthesis of compilable code from incomplete snippets using Large Language Models (LLMs). ZS4C operates in two stages: first, it uses an LLM, like GPT-3.5, to identify missing import statements in a snippet; second, it collaborates with a validator (e.g., compiler) to fix compilation errors caused by incorrect imports and syntax issues. We evaluated ZS4C on the StatType-SO benchmark and a new dataset, Python-SO, which includes 539 Python snippets from Stack Overflow across the 20 most popular Python libraries. ZS4C significantly outperforms existing methods, improving the compilation rate from 63% to 95.1% compared to the state-of-the-art SnR, marking a 50.1% improvement. On average, ZS4C can infer more accurate import statements (with an F1 score of 0.98) than SnR, with an improvement of 8.5% in the F1.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted and published in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), [2024], [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3702979]</p></details> |

However, these studies have predominantly focused on English language tasks. In this paper, we address the fundamental research question: Can LLMs serve as proficient training data generators for other language tasks? Specifically, we leverage LLMs to synthesize supervised training data under few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios across six diverse Japanese downstream tasks. Subsequently, we utilize this synthesized data to train compact models (e.g., BERT). This novel methodology is termed JAPAGEN. Our experimental findings underscore that JAPAGEN achieves robust performance in classification tasks that necessitate formal text inputs, demonstrating competitive results compared to conventional LLM prompting strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PACLIC38 (2024)</p></details> |

To evaluate LLMs' ability to complete data-cleaning tasks, we implemented a pipeline for LLM-based Auto Data Cleaning Workflow (AutoDCWorkflow), prompting LLMs on data cleaning operations to repair three types of data quality issues: duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent data formats. Given a dirty table and a purpose (expressed as a query), this pipeline generates a minimal, clean table sufficient to address the purpose and the data cleaning workflow used to produce the table. The planning process involves three main LLM-driven components: (1) Select Target Columns: Identifies a set of target columns related to the purpose. (2) Inspect Column Quality: Assesses the data quality for each target column and generates a Data Quality Report as operation objectives. (3) Generate Operation & Arguments: Predicts the next operation and arguments based on the data quality report results. Additionally, we propose a data cleaning benchmark to evaluate the capability of LLM agents to automatically generate workflows that address data cleaning purposes of varying difficulty levels. The benchmark comprises the annotated datasets as a collection of purpose, raw table, clean table, data cleaning workflow, and answer set. In our experiments, we evaluated three LLMs that auto-generate purpose-driven data cleaning workflows. The results indicate that LLMs perform well in planning and generating data-cleaning workflows without the need for fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[FullStack Bench: Evaluating LLMs as Full Stack Coders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00535v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the capabilities of code large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their applications across diverse code intelligence domains are rapidly increasing. However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Exploring Critical Testing Scenarios for Decision-Making Policies: An LLM Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06684v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed surprising achievements of decision-making policies across various fields, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Testing for decision-making policies is crucial with the existence of critical scenarios that may threaten their reliability. Numerous research efforts have been dedicated to testing these policies. However, there are still significant challenges, such as low testing efficiency and diversity due to the complexity of the policies and environments under test. Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), in this paper, we propose an LLM-driven online testing framework for efficiently testing decision-making policies. The main idea is to employ an LLM-based test scenario generator to intelligently generate challenging test cases through contemplation and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a "generate-test-feedback" pipeline and apply templated prompt engineering to fully leverage the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Then, we introduce a multi-scale scenario generation strategy to address the inherent challenges LLMs face in making fine adjustments, further enhancing testing efficiency. Finally, we evaluate the LLM-driven approach on five widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in uncovering both critical and diverse scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Toward LLM-Agent-Based Modeling of Transportation Systems: A Conceptual Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06681v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In transportation system demand modeling and simulation, agent-based models and microsimulations are current state-of-the-art approaches. However, existing agent-based models still have some limitations on behavioral realism and resource demand that limit their applicability. In this study, leveraging the emerging technology of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, we propose a general LLM-agent-based modeling framework for transportation systems. We argue that LLM agents not only possess the essential capabilities to function as agents but also offer promising solutions to overcome some limitations of existing agent-based models. Our conceptual framework design closely replicates the decision-making and interaction processes and traits of human travelers within transportation networks, and we demonstrate that the proposed systems can meet critical behavioral criteria for decision-making and learning behaviors using related studies and a demonstrative example of LLM agents' learning and adjustment in the bottleneck setting. Although further refinement of the LLM-agent-based modeling framework is necessary, we believe that this approach has the potential to improve transportation system modeling and simulation.</p></details> |  |

A comparison between human and LLM labelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16851v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly detecting problematic research articles is crucial to safeguarding the integrity of scientific research. This study explores whether Twitter mentions of retracted articles can signal potential problems with the articles prior to their retraction, potentially serving as an early warning system for scholars. To investigate this, we analysed a dataset of 4,354 Twitter mentions associated with 504 retracted articles. The effectiveness of Twitter mentions in predicting article retractions was evaluated by both manual and Large Language Model (LLM) labelling. Manual labelling results indicated that 25.7% of tweets signalled problems before retraction. Using the manual labelling results as the baseline, we found that LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) outperformed lexicon-based sentiment analysis tools (e.g., TextBlob) in detecting potential problems, suggesting that automatic detection of problematic articles from social media using LLMs is technically feasible. Nevertheless, since only a small proportion of retracted articles (11.1%) were criticised on Twitter prior to retraction, such automatic systems would detect only a minority of problematic articles. Overall, this study offers insights into how social media data, coupled with emerging generative AI techniques, can support research integrity.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, differences in training configurations and data processing across model families lead to significant variations in benchmark performance, making it difficult for a single scaling law to generalize across all LLMs. On the other hand, training family-specific scaling laws requires training models of varying sizes for every family. In this work, we propose Skills Scaling Laws (SSLaws, pronounced as Sloth), a novel scaling law that leverages publicly available benchmark data and assumes LLM performance is driven by low-dimensional latent skills, such as reasoning and instruction following. These latent skills are influenced by computational resources like model size and training tokens but with varying efficiencies across model families. Sloth exploits correlations across benchmarks to provide more accurate and interpretable predictions while alleviating the need to train multiple LLMs per family. We present both theoretical results on parameter identification and empirical evaluations on 12 prominent benchmarks, from Open LLM Leaderboard v1/v2, demonstrating that Sloth predicts LLM performance efficiently and offers insights into scaling behaviors for downstream tasks such as coding and emotional intelligence applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Universal Truthfulness Hyperplane Inside LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08582v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various fields, hallucination remains a significant challenge. Recent studies have explored hallucinations through the lens of internal representations, proposing mechanisms to decipher LLMs' adherence to facts. However, these approaches often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, leading to concerns about whether internal representation patterns reflect fundamental factual awareness, or only overfit spurious correlations on the specific datasets. In this work, we investigate whether a universal truthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model's factually correct and incorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number of training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation -- we train the truthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine its cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results indicate that increasing the diversity of the training datasets significantly enhances the performance in all scenarios, while the volume of data samples plays a less critical role. This finding supports the optimistic hypothesis that a universal truthfulness hyperplane may indeed exist within the model, offering promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we focus on the issue of integrating expert feedback in the form of labeled example passages into LLM-based pipelines, and compare the two strategies of (1) a dynamic selection of few-shot examples and (2) the automatic optimization of the prompt by the LLM itself. Our findings on a public dataset of 769 climate-related passages from real-world business reports indicate that automatic prompt optimization is the superior approach, while combining both methods provides only limited benefit. Qualitative results indicate that optimized prompts do indeed capture many intricacies of the targeted emission goal extraction task.</p></details> |  |

OpenAI 2023 Lawsuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06370v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Copyright infringement in frontier LLMs has received much attention recently due to the New York Times v. OpenAI lawsuit, filed in December 2023. The New York Times claims that GPT-4 has infringed its copyrights by reproducing articles for use in LLM training and by memorizing the inputs, thereby publicly displaying them in LLM outputs. Our work aims to measure the propensity of OpenAI's LLMs to exhibit verbatim memorization in its outputs relative to other LLMs, specifically focusing on news articles. We discover that both GPT and Claude models use refusal training and output filters to prevent verbatim output of the memorized articles. We apply a basic prompt template to bypass the refusal training and show that OpenAI models are currently less prone to memorization elicitation than models from Meta, Mistral, and Anthropic. We find that as models increase in size, especially beyond 100 billion parameters, they demonstrate significantly greater capacity for memorization. Our findings have practical implications for training: more attention must be placed on preventing verbatim memorization in very large models. Our findings also have legal significance: in assessing the relative memorization capacity of OpenAI's LLMs, we probe the strength of The New York Times's copyright infringement claims and OpenAI's legal defenses, while underscoring issues at the intersection of generative AI, law, and policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the potential of LLM-assisted annotation for corpus-based pragmatics and discourse analysis: The case of apology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08339v5)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Certain forms of linguistic annotation, like part of speech and semantic tagging, can be automated with high accuracy. However, manual annotation is still necessary for complex pragmatic and discursive features that lack a direct mapping to lexical forms. This manual process is time-consuming and error-prone, limiting the scalability of function-to-form approaches in corpus linguistics. To address this, our study explores the possibility of using large language models (LLMs) to automate pragma-discursive corpus annotation. We compare GPT-3.5 (the model behind the free-to-use version of ChatGPT), GPT-4 (the model underpinning the precise mode of Bing chatbot), and a human coder in annotating apology components in English based on the local grammar framework. We find that GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, with accuracy approaching that of a human coder. These results suggest that LLMs can be successfully deployed to aid pragma-discursive corpus annotation, making the process more efficient, scalable and accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 2 figures, 3 tablels</p></details> |

However, these LLM-based evaluators exhibit position bias, or inconsistency, when used to evaluate candidate answers in pairwise comparisons, favoring either the first or second answer regardless of content. To address this limitation, we propose PORTIA, an alignment-based system designed to mimic human comparison strategies to calibrate position bias in a lightweight yet effective manner. Specifically, PORTIA splits the answers into multiple segments, aligns similar content across candidate answers, and then merges them back into a single prompt for evaluation by LLMs. We conducted extensive experiments with six diverse LLMs to evaluate 11,520 answer pairs. Our results show that PORTIA markedly enhances the consistency rates for all the models and comparison forms tested, achieving an average relative improvement of 47.46%. Remarkably, PORTIA enables less advanced GPT models to achieve 88% agreement with the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model at just 10% of the cost. Furthermore, it rectifies around 80% of the position bias instances within the GPT-4 model, elevating its consistency rate up to 98%. Subsequent human evaluations indicate that the PORTIA-enhanced GPT-3.5 model can even surpass the standalone GPT-4 in terms of alignment with human evaluators. These findings highlight PORTIA's ability to correct position bias, improve LLM consistency, and boost performance while keeping cost-efficiency. This represents a valuable step toward a more reliable and scalable use of LLMs for automated evaluations across diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024.

While traditional methods depend on the inherent knowledge of LLMs without fine-tuning, more recent approaches have shifted toward the reinforcement learning strategy to further enhance agents' ability to solve complex interactive tasks with environments and tools. However, previous approaches are constrained by the sparse reward issue, where existing datasets solely provide a final scalar reward for each multi-step reasoning chain, potentially leading to ineffectiveness and inefficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we introduce StepAgent, which utilizes step-wise reward to optimize the agent's reinforcement learning process. Inheriting the spirit of novice-to-expert theory, we first compare the actions of the expert and the agent to automatically generate intermediate rewards for fine-grained optimization. Additionally, we propose implicit-reward and inverse reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate agent reflection and policy adjustment. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates that the action distribution of the agent can converge toward the expert action distribution over multiple training cycles. Experimental results across various datasets indicate that StepAgent outperforms existing baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

This has led to speculation that the orchestration of these repository-level tasks could lead to software engineering agents capable of performing almost independently of human intervention. However, of the suite of tasks that would need to be performed by this autonomous software engineering agent, we argue that one important task is missing, which is to fulfil project level dependency by installing other repositories. To investigate the feasibility of this repository level installation task, we introduce a benchmark of of repository installation tasks curated from 40 open source Python projects, which includes a ground truth installation process for each target repository. Further, we propose Installamatic, an agent which aims to perform and verify the installation of a given repository by searching for relevant instructions from documentation in the repository. Empirical experiments reveal that that 55% of the studied repositories can be automatically installed by our agent at least one out of ten times. Through further analysis, we identify the common causes for our agent's inability to install a repository, discuss the challenges faced in the design and implementation of such an agent and consider the implications that such an agent could have for developers.</p></details> |  |

However, relying on these traditional methods of cooking often results in missing ingredients, nutritional hazards, and unsatisfactory meals. Using Augmented Reality (AR) can address these issues; however, current AR cooking applications have poor user interfaces and limited accessibility. This paper proposes a prototype of an iOS application that integrates AR and Computer Vision (CV) into the cooking process. We leverage Google's Gemini Large Language Model (LLM) to identify ingredients in the camera's field of vision and generate recipe choices with detailed nutritional information. Additionally, this application uses Apple's ARKit to create an AR user interface compatible with iOS devices. Users can personalize their meal suggestions by inputting their dietary preferences and rating each meal. The application's effectiveness is evaluated through three rounds of user experience surveys. This application advances the field of accessible cooking assistance technologies, aiming to reduce food wastage and improve the meal planning experience.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, mitigating hallucination remains a significant challenge, with state-of-the-art LLMs still frequently generating incorrect legal references. In this paper, we focus on the problem of legal citation prediction within the Australian law context, where correctly identifying and citing relevant legislations or precedents is critical. We compare several approaches: prompting general purpose and law-specialised LLMs, retrieval-only pipelines with both generic and domain-specific embeddings, task-specific instruction-tuning of LLMs, and hybrid strategies that combine LLMs with retrieval augmentation, query expansion, or voting ensembles. Our findings indicate that domain-specific pre-training alone is insufficient for achieving satisfactory citation accuracy even after law-specialised pre-training. In contrast, instruction tuning on our task-specific dataset dramatically boosts performance reaching the best results across all settings. We also highlight that database granularity along with the type of embeddings play a critical role in the performance of retrieval systems. Among retrieval-based approaches, hybrid methods consistently outperform retrieval-only setups, and among these, ensemble voting delivers the best result by combining the predictive quality of instruction-tuned LLMs with the retrieval system.</p></details> | <details><summary>For c...</summary><p>For code, data, and models see https://auslawbench.github.io</p></details> |

DebateBrawl addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs in strategic planning by incorporating evolutionary optimization and game-theoretic techniques. The system demonstrates remarkable performance in generating coherent, contextually relevant arguments while adapting its strategy in real-time. Experimental results involving 23 debates show balanced outcomes between AI and human participants, with the AI system achieving an average score of 2.72 compared to the human average of 2.67 out of 10. User feedback indicates significant improvements in debating skills and a highly satisfactory learning experience, with 85% of users reporting improved debating abilities and 78% finding the AI opponent appropriately challenging. The system's ability to maintain high factual accuracy (92% compared to 78% in human-only debates) while generating diverse arguments addresses critical concerns in AI-assisted discourse. DebateBrawl not only serves as an effective educational tool but also contributes to the broader goal of improving public discourse through AI-assisted argumentation. The paper discusses the ethical implications of AI in persuasive contexts and outlines the measures implemented to ensure responsible development and deployment of the system, including robust fact-checking mechanisms and transparency in decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Pangea, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PangeaIns, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PangeaIns features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we introduce PangeaBench, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that Pangea significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance. We fully open-source our data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.</p></details> | 54 pages, 27 figures |

Existing works primarily treat LLMs' activations as points in space and modify them by adding steering vectors. However, this approach is limited in its ability to achieve greater performance improvement while maintaining the necessary consistency of activation magnitudes. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel editing method that views activations in terms of their directions and magnitudes. Our method, named Householder Pseudo-Rotation (HPR), mimics the rotation transformation, thus preserving activation norms and resulting in an improved performance on various safety benchmarks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

| **[Trustful LLMs: Customizing and Grounding Text Generation with Knowledge Bases and Dual Decoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07870v4)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although people are impressed by the content generation skills of large language models, the use of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is limited by the domain grounding of the content. The correctness and groundedness of the generated content need to be based on a verified context, such as results from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One important issue when adapting LLMs to a customized domain is that the generated responses are often incomplete, or the additions are not verified and may even be hallucinated. Prior studies on hallucination detection have focused on evaluation metrics, which are not easily adaptable to dynamic domains and can be vulnerable to attacks like jail-breaking. In this work, we propose 1) a post-processing algorithm that leverages knowledge triplets in RAG context to correct hallucinations and 2) a dual-decoder model that fuses RAG context to guide the generation process.</p></details> |  |

Capturing and modeling deep semantic information, such as a user's preference for "H\"aagen-Dazs' HEAVEN strawberry light ice cream" due to its health-conscious and premium attributes, is challenging. Traditional semantic modeling often overlooks these intricate details at the user and item levels. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel approach that models deep semantic information end-to-end, leveraging the comprehensive world knowledge capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our proposed LLM-infused CTR prediction framework(Multi-level Deep Semantic Information Infused CTR model via Distillation, MSD) is designed to uncover deep semantic insights by utilizing LLMs to extract and distill critical information into a smaller, more efficient model, enabling seamless end-to-end training and inference. Importantly, our framework is carefully designed to balance efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that the model not only achieves high performance but also operates with optimal resource utilization. Online A/B tests conducted on the Meituan sponsored-search system demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of Cost Per Mile (CPM) and CTR, validating its effectiveness, scalability, and balanced approach in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures,4 tables</p></details> |
| **[GPT Semantic Cache: Reducing LLM Costs and Latency via Semantic Embedding Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05276v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text across a wide range of applications. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique achieves a notable reduction in operational costs while significantly enhancing response times, making it a robust solution for optimizing LLM-powered applications. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT Semantic Cache reduces API calls by up to 68.8% across various query categories, with cache hit rates ranging from 61.6% to 68.8%. Additionally, the system achieves high accuracy, with positive hit rates exceeding 97%, confirming the reliability of cached responses. This technique not only reduces operational costs, but also improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Forecasting with LLMs: Understanding and Enhancing Model Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10835v4)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been applied in many fields and have developed rapidly in recent years. As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter</p></details> |

However, previous research observes that certain weights in the LLM, known as outliers, are significantly sensitive to quantization noises. Existing quantization methods leave these outliers as floating points or higher precisions to retain performance, posting challenges on the efficient hardware deployment of the mixed-precision model. This work investigates an alternative way to tame the sensitive weights' impact on the quantization error, by reducing the loss Hessian trace with respect to outliers through an efficient fine-tuning process. We propose Noise Perturbation Fine-tuning (NPFT), which identifies outlier weights and add random weight perturbations on the outliers as the model going through a PEFT optimization. NPFT tames the sensitivity of outlier weights so that the quantized model performance can be improved without special treatment to the outliers. When applied to OPT and LLaMA models, our NPFT method achieves stable performance improvements for both uniform and non-uniform quantizers, while also offering better inference efficiency. Notably, the simplest RTN can achieve performance on par with GPTQ using our NPFT on LLaMA2-7B-4bits benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CPAL 2024</p></details> |

While increasing parameter counts enhances accuracy, it also widens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a framework to accelerate LLM inference on specific hardware while preserving their capabilities. Through an innovative application of neural architecture search (NAS) at an unprecedented scale, Puzzle systematically optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters under hardware constraints. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization. We demonstrate the real-world impact of our framework through Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B), a publicly available model derived from Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. Nemotron-51B achieves a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while preserving 98.4% of the original model's capabilities. Nemotron-51B currently stands as the most accurate language model capable of inference on a single GPU with large batch sizes. Remarkably, this transformation required just 45B training tokens, compared to over 15T tokens used for the 70B model it was derived from. This establishes a new paradigm where powerful models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible compromise of their capabilities, demonstrating that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection. With the release of Nemotron-51B and the presentation of the Puzzle framework, we provide practitioners immediate access to state-of-the-art language modeling capabilities at significantly reduced computational costs.</p></details> |  |

The advent of powerful tools such as large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of these robots in environmental perception and decision-making. However, the introduction of these intelligent agents has led to security threats such as jailbreak attacks and adversarial attacks. In this research, we take a further step by proposing a backdoor attack specifically targeting robotic manipulation and, for the first time, implementing backdoor attack in the physical world. By embedding a backdoor visual language model into the visual perception module within the robotic system, we successfully mislead the robotic arm's operation in the physical world, given the presence of common items as triggers. Experimental evaluations in the physical world demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Initi...</summary><p>Initial version with preliminary results.

Nowadays, Large Language models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance in generating empathetic responses. Knowledge bases like COMET can assist LLMs in mitigating illusions and enhancing the understanding of users' intentions and emotions. However, models remain heavily reliant on fixed knowledge bases and unrestricted incorporation of external knowledge can introduce noise. Tool learning is a flexible end-to-end approach that assists LLMs in handling complex problems. In this paper, we propose Emotional Knowledge Tool Calling (EKTC) framework, which encapsulates the commonsense knowledge bases as empathetic tools, enabling LLMs to integrate external knowledge flexibly through tool calling. In order to adapt the models to the new task, we construct a novel dataset TOOL-ED based on the EMPATHETICMPATHETIC DIALOGUE (ED) dataset. We validate EKTC on the ED dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that our framework can enhance the ability of LLMs to generate empathetic responses effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPRM: A LLM-based Continual Pre-training Framework for Relevance Modeling in Commercial Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01269v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[XKV: Personalized KV Cache Memory Reduction for Long-Context LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05896v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently the generative Large Language Model (LLM) has achieved remarkable success in numerous applications. Notably its inference generates output tokens one-by-one, leading to many redundant computations. The widely-used KV-Cache framework makes a compromise between time and space complexities. However, caching data generates the increasingly growing memory demand, that can quickly exhaust the limited memory capacity of the modern accelerator like GPUs, particularly in long-context inference tasks. Existing studies reduce memory consumption by evicting some of cached data that have less important impact on inference accuracy. But the benefit in practice is far from ideal due to the static cache allocation across different LLM network layers. This paper observes that the layer-specific cached data have very different impacts on accuracy. We quantify this difference, and give experimental and theoretical validation. We accordingly make a formal analysis and shows that customizing the cache size for each layer in a personalized manner can yield a significant memory reduction, while still providing comparable accuracy. We simulate the cache allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem and give a global optimal solution. In particular, we devise a mini- and sampling-based inference over a lightweight variant of the LLM model, so as to quickly capture the difference and then feed it into the personalized algorithms. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposals can reduce KV cache memory consumption by 61.6% on average, improve computational efficiency by 2.1x and then increase the throughput by up to 5.5x.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the Governance of the Commons Simulation (GovSim), a generative simulation platform designed to study strategic interactions and cooperative decision-making in LLMs. In GovSim, a society of AI agents must collectively balance exploiting a common resource with sustaining it for future use. This environment enables the study of how ethical considerations, strategic planning, and negotiation skills impact cooperative outcomes. We develop an LLM-based agent architecture and test it with the leading open and closed LLMs. We find that all but the most powerful LLM agents fail to achieve a sustainable equilibrium in GovSim, with the highest survival rate below 54%. Ablations reveal that successful multi-agent communication between agents is critical for achieving cooperation in these cases. Furthermore, our analyses show that the failure to achieve sustainable cooperation in most LLMs stems from their inability to formulate and analyze hypotheses about the long-term effects of their actions on the equilibrium of the group. Finally, we show that agents that leverage "Universalization"-based reasoning, a theory of moral thinking, are able to achieve significantly better sustainability. Taken together, GovSim enables us to study the mechanisms that underlie sustainable self-government with specificity and scale. We open source the full suite of our research results, including the simulation environment, agent prompts, and a comprehensive web interface.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

To address this problem, we propose a Cooperative SQL Generation framework based on Multi-functional Agents (CSMA) through information interaction among large language model (LLM) based agents who own part of the database schema seperately. Inspired by the collaboration in human teamwork, CSMA consists of three stages: 1) Question-related schema collection, 2) Question-corresponding SQL query generation, and 3) SQL query correctness check. In the first stage, agents analyze their respective schema and communicate with each other to collect the schema information relevant to the question. In the second stage, agents try to generate the corresponding SQL query for the question using the collected information. In the third stage, agents check if the SQL query is created correctly according to their known information. This interaction-based method makes the question-relevant part of database schema from each agent to be used for SQL generation and check. Experiments on the Spider and Bird benckmark demonstrate that CSMA achieves a high performance level comparable to the state-of-the-arts, meanwhile holding the private data in these individual agents.</p></details> |  |

Especially, the GPT-4o's excellent duplex speech interaction ability has brought impressive experience to users. Researchers have recently proposed several multi-modal LLMs in this direction that can achieve user-agent speech-to-speech conversations. This paper proposes a novel speech-text multimodal LLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main contribution is that the speech input and output modalities can be easily connected to a textual LLM while keeping the LLM's parameters frozen throughout the training process. We design a three-stage training strategy for modeling both the speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain speech-to-speech conversation ability using text-speech paired data (such as ASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&A data on 8 GPUs. Moreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in the speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text modality of its backbone LLM, while achieving low latency end-to-end spoken response. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue ability through multi-task training, giving Freeze-Omni a more natural style of dialogue ability between users and agents. In summary, Freeze-Omni holds great potential to conduct speech-to-speech dialogue based on a multimodal LLM under the condition of a frozen LLM, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by limited data and training resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://freeze-omni.github.io/</p></details> |

Building upon pre-trained LLMs, this family of models further develops multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities that are impressive, such as writing code given a flow chart or creating stories based on an image. In the development process, evaluation is critical since it provides intuitive feedback and guidance on improving models. Distinct from the traditional train-eval-test paradigm that only favors a single task like image classification, the versatility of MLLMs has spurred the rise of various new benchmarks and evaluation methods. In this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive survey of MLLM evaluation, discussing four key aspects: 1) the summarised benchmarks types divided by the evaluation capabilities, including foundation capabilities, model self-analysis, and extented applications; 2) the typical process of benchmark counstruction, consisting of data collection, annotation, and precautions; 3) the systematic evaluation manner composed of judge, metric, and toolkit; 4) the outlook for the next benchmark.

These risks include leaking system prompts, personally identifiable information, training data, and model parameters. Most existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage rely on humans to craft the adversarial prompts. A few automated methods are proposed for system prompt extraction, but they cannot be applied to more severe risks (e.g., training data extraction) and have limited effectiveness even for system prompt extraction. In this paper, we propose PrivAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. We formulate different risks as a search problem with a unified attack goal. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through reinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for different target models under different risks. We propose a novel reward function to provide effective and fine-grained rewards for the attack agent. Finally, we introduce customizations to better fit our general framework to system prompt extraction and training data extraction. Through extensive evaluations, we first show that PrivAgent outperforms existing automated methods in system prompt leakage against six popular LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves a 100% success rate in extracting system prompts from real-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store. We also show PrivAgent's effectiveness in extracting training data from an open-source LLM with a success rate of 5.9%. We further demonstrate PrivAgent's effectiveness in evading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better safety alignment. Finally, we validate our customized designs through a detailed ablation study. We release our code here https://github.com/rucnyz/RedAgent.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating this capability in LLMs is challenging due to the complex dynamics involved in role-playing, such as maintaining character fidelity throughout a storyline and navigating open-ended narratives without a definitive ground truth. Current evaluation methods, which primarily focus on question-answering or conversational snapshots, fall short of adequately capturing the nuanced character traits and behaviors essential for authentic role-playing. In this paper, we propose CharacterBox, which is a simulation sandbox designed to generate situational fine-grained character behavior trajectories. These behavior trajectories enable a more comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of role-playing capabilities. CharacterBox consists of two main components: the character agent and the narrator agent. The character agent, grounded in psychological and behavioral science, exhibits human-like behaviors, while the narrator agent coordinates interactions between character agents and environmental changes. Additionally, we introduce two trajectory-based methods that leverage CharacterBox to enhance LLM performance. To reduce costs and facilitate the adoption of CharacterBox by public communities, we fine-tune two smaller models, CharacterNR and CharacterRM, as substitutes for GPT API calls, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to advanced GPT APIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM with Relation Classifier for Document-Level Relation Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13889v2)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have created a new paradigm for natural language processing. Despite their advancement, LLM-based methods still lag behind traditional approaches in document-level relation extraction (DocRE), a critical task for understanding complex entity relations within long context. This paper investigates the causes of this performance gap, identifying the dispersion of attention by LLMs due to entity pairs without relations as a key factor. We then introduce a novel classifier-LLM approach to DocRE. Particularly, the proposed approach begins with a classifier designed to select entity pair candidates that exhibit potential relations and then feed them to LLM for final relation classification. This method ensures that the LLM's attention is directed at relation-expressing entity pairs instead of those without relations during inference. Experiments on DocRE benchmarks reveal that our method significantly outperforms recent LLM-based DocRE models and narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art BERT-based models.</p></details> |  |

In a preregistered online experiment, 300 professional translators completed 1,800 tasks using one of 13 LLMs (or a control). A tenfold increase in model compute improved task completion speed by 12.3%, grades by 0.18 standard deviations, and earnings per minute by 16.1%. Gains were four times larger for lower-skilled workers. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by at least 6.9% over the next decade.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Learning to Reason: Comparing LLMs with Neuro-Symbolic on Arithmetic Relations in Abstract Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05586v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work compares large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic approaches in solving Raven's progressive matrices (RPM), a visual abstract reasoning test that involves the understanding of mathematical rules such as progression or arithmetic addition. Providing the visual attributes directly as textual prompts, which assumes an oracle visual perception module, allows us to measure the model's abstract reasoning capability in isolation. Despite providing such compositionally structured representations from the oracle visual perception and advanced prompting techniques, both GPT-4 and Llama-3 70B cannot achieve perfect accuracy on the center constellation of the I-RAVEN dataset. Our analysis reveals that the root cause lies in the LLM's weakness in understanding and executing arithmetic rules. As a potential remedy, we analyze the Abductive Rule Learner with Context-awareness (ARLC), a neuro-symbolic approach that learns to reason with vector-symbolic architectures (VSAs). Here, concepts are represented with distributed vectors s.t. dot products between encoded vectors define a similarity kernel, and simple element-wise operations on the vectors perform addition/subtraction on the encoded values. We find that ARLC achieves almost perfect accuracy on the center constellation of I-RAVEN, demonstrating a high fidelity in arithmetic rules. To stress the length generalization capabilities of the models, we extend the RPM tests to larger matrices (3x10 instead of typical 3x3) and larger dynamic ranges of the attribute values (from 10 up to 1000). We find that the LLM's accuracy of solving arithmetic rules drops to sub-10%, especially as the dynamic range expands, while ARLC can maintain a high accuracy due to emulating symbolic computations on top of properly distributed representations. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/raven-large-language-models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Use of LLMs for SQL Equivalence Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05561v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivalence checking of two SQL queries is an intractable problem encountered in diverse contexts ranging from grading student submissions in a DBMS course to debugging query rewriting rules in an optimizer, and many more. While a lot of progress has been made in recent years in developing practical solutions for this problem, the existing methods can handle only a small subset of SQL, even for bounded equivalence checking. They cannot support sophisticated SQL expressions one encounters in practice. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) -- such as GPT-4 -- have emerged as power generators of SQL from natural language specifications. This paper explores whether LLMs can also demonstrate the ability to reason with SQL queries and help advance SQL equivalence checking. Towards this, we conducted a detailed evaluation of several LLMs over collections with SQL pairs of varying levels of complexity. We explored the efficacy of different prompting techniques, the utility of synthetic examples & explanations, as well as logical plans generated by query parsers. Our main finding is that with well-designed prompting using an unoptimized SQL Logical Plan, LLMs can perform equivalence checking beyond the capabilities of current techniques, achieving nearly 100% accuracy for equivalent pairs and up to 70% for non-equivalent pairs of SQL queries. While LLMs lack the ability to generate formal proofs, their synthetic examples and human-readable explanations offer valuable insights to students (& instructors) in a classroom setting and to database administrators (DBAs) managing large database installations. Additionally, we also show that with careful fine-tuning, we can close the performance gap between smaller (and efficient) models and larger models such as GPT, thus paving the way for potential LLM-integration in standalone data processing systems.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Real&Synthetic Dataset and Linear Attention in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03814v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) aims to recover high-quality images from degraded inputs, with recent deep learning advancements significantly enhancing performance. However, existing methods lack a unified training benchmark for iterations and configurations. We also identify a bias in image complexity distributions between commonly used IR training and testing datasets, resulting in suboptimal restoration outcomes. To address this, we introduce a large-scale IR dataset called ReSyn, which employs a novel image filtering method based on image complexity to ensure a balanced distribution and includes both real and AIGC synthetic images. We establish a unified training standard that specifies iterations and configurations for image restoration models, focusing on measuring model convergence and restoration capability. Additionally, we enhance transformer-based image restoration models using linear attention mechanisms by proposing RWKV-IR, which integrates linear complexity RWKV into the transformer structure, allowing for both global and local receptive fields. Instead of directly using Vision-RWKV, we replace the original Q-Shift in RWKV with a Depth-wise Convolution shift to better model local dependencies, combined with Bi-directional attention for comprehensive linear attention. We also introduce a Cross-Bi-WKV module that merges two Bi-WKV modules with different scanning orders for balanced horizontal and vertical attention. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our RWKV-IR model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Variational Translator for Bridging Image Restoration and High-Level Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08149v3)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research tries to extend image restoration capabilities from human perception to machine perception, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks in degraded environments. These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/VaT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Diffusion Prior for Image Super-Resolution with Domain Shift SDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17778v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) models have attracted substantial interest due to their powerful image restoration capabilities. However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

| **[Modeling Dual-Exposure Quad-Bayer Patterns for Joint Denoising and Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07256v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image degradation caused by noise and blur remains a persistent challenge in imaging systems, stemming from limitations in both hardware and methodology. Single-image solutions face an inherent tradeoff between noise reduction and motion blur. While short exposures can capture clear motion, they suffer from noise amplification. Long exposures reduce noise but introduce blur. Learning-based single-image enhancers tend to be over-smooth due to the limited information. Multi-image solutions using burst mode avoid this tradeoff by capturing more spatial-temporal information but often struggle with misalignment from camera/scene motion. To address these limitations, we propose a physical-model-based image restoration approach leveraging a novel dual-exposure Quad-Bayer pattern sensor. By capturing pairs of short and long exposures at the same starting point but with varying durations, this method integrates complementary noise-blur information within a single image. We further introduce a Quad-Bayer synthesis method (B2QB) to simulate sensor data from Bayer patterns to facilitate training. Based on this dual-exposure sensor model, we design a hierarchical convolutional neural network called QRNet to recover high-quality RGB images. The network incorporates input enhancement blocks and multi-level feature extraction to improve restoration quality. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art deblurring and denoising methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The code, model, and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/zhaoyuzhi/QRNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |

With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, transformer-based methods with pyramid structures have advanced the field by capturing long-range cross-scale spatial interaction. Despite its popularity, the degradation of essential features during the upsampling process notably compromised the restoration performance, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction outcomes. We introduce the EchoIR, an UNet-like image restoration network with a bilateral learnable upsampling mechanism to bridge this gap. Specifically, we proposed the Echo-Upsampler that optimizes the upsampling process by learning from the bilateral intermediate features of U-Net, the "Echo", aiming for a more refined restoration by minimizing the degradation during upsampling. In pursuit of modeling a hierarchical model of image restoration and upsampling tasks, we propose the Approximated Sequential Bi-level Optimization (AS-BLO), an advanced bi-level optimization model establishing a relationship between upsampling learning and image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods demonstrate the proposed EchoIR surpasses the existing methods, achieving SOTA performance in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Progressive Image Restoration Network for High-order Degradation Imaging in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07195v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep learning methods have gained remarkable achievements in the field of image restoration for remote sensing (RS). However, most existing RS image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real remote sensing images.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Existing methods often struggle with slow processing times and suboptimal restoration, especially under severe degradation, failing to accurately reconstruct finer-level identity details. To address these issues, we introduce InstantRestore, a novel framework that leverages a single-step image diffusion model and an attention-sharing mechanism for fast and personalized face restoration. Additionally, InstantRestore incorporates a novel landmark attention loss, aligning key facial landmarks to refine the attention maps, enhancing identity preservation. At inference time, given a degraded input and a small (~4) set of reference images, InstantRestore performs a single forward pass through the network to achieve near real-time performance. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full diffusion processes or per-identity model tuning, InstantRestore offers a scalable solution suitable for large-scale applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstantRestore outperforms existing methods in quality and speed, making it an appealing choice for identity-preserving face restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/InstantRestore/</p></details> |

Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

While recent diffusion-based restoration methods, which leverage generative priors from text-to-image models, have made progress in recovering more realistic details, they still encounter "generative capability deactivation" when applied to out-of-distribution real-world data. To address this, we propose using text as an auxiliary invariant representation to reactivate the generative capabilities of these models. We begin by identifying two key properties of text input: richness and relevance, and examine their respective influence on model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce Res-Captioner, a module that generates enhanced textual descriptions tailored to image content and degradation levels, effectively mitigating response failures. Additionally, we present RealIR, a new benchmark designed to capture diverse real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Res-Captioner significantly enhances the generalization abilities of diffusion-based restoration models, while remaining fully plug-and-play.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, incorporating well-shot personal images as additional reference inputs could be a promising strategy. Inspired by the recent success of the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), we propose ReF-LDM, an adaptation of LDM designed to generate HQ face images conditioned on one LQ image and multiple HQ reference images. Our model integrates an effective and efficient mechanism, CacheKV, to leverage the reference images during the generation process. Additionally, we design a timestep-scaled identity loss, enabling our LDM-based model to focus on learning the discriminating features of human faces. Lastly, we construct FFHQ-Ref, a dataset consisting of 20,405 high-quality (HQ) face images with corresponding reference images, which can serve as both training and evaluation data for reference-based face restoration models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024, project page https://chiweihsiao.github.io/refldm.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Equivariant Denoisers for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05343v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One key ingredient of image restoration is to define a realistic prior on clean images to complete the missing information in the observation. State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Moreover, typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of this algorithm and discuss its practical benefit.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaFormer: High-fidelity Metalens Imaging via Aberration Correcting Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04591v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metalens is an emerging optical system with an irreplaceable merit in that it can be manufactured in ultra-thin and compact sizes, which shows great promise of various applications such as medical imaging and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). Despite its advantage in miniaturization, its practicality is constrained by severe aberrations and distortions, which significantly degrade the image quality. Several previous arts have attempted to address different types of aberrations, yet most of them are mainly designed for the traditional bulky lens and not convincing enough to remedy harsh aberrations of the metalens. While there have existed aberration correction methods specifically for metalens, they still fall short of restoration quality. In this work, we propose MetaFormer, an aberration correction framework for metalens-captured images, harnessing Vision Transformers (ViT) that has shown remarkable restoration performance in diverse image restoration tasks. Specifically, we devise a Multiple Adaptive Filters Guidance (MAFG), where multiple Wiener filters enrich the degraded input images with various noise-detail balances, enhancing output restoration quality. In addition, we introduce a Spatial and Transposed self-Attention Fusion (STAF) module, which aggregates features from spatial self-attention and transposed self-attention modules to further ameliorate aberration correction. We conduct extensive experiments, including correcting aberrated images and videos, and clean 3D reconstruction from the degraded images. The proposed method outperforms the previous arts by a significant margin. We further fabricate a metalens and verify the practicality of MetaFormer by restoring the images captured with the manufactured metalens in the wild.

| **[Deep priors for satellite image restoration with accurate uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04130v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite optical images, upon their on-ground receipt, offer a distorted view of the observed scene. Their restoration, classically including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restoration could be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoiding propagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require to train a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single network to restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive the uncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimization scheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating the uncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalable posterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, we propose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficiently computes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images, asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xz and SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversion methods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posterior samples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is not required.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Underwater Image Restoration using Co-Operational Regressor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03995v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration of underwater environments is essential for applications such as biological research, archaeology, and infrastructure maintenanceHowever, underwater imaging is challenging due to the waters unique properties, including scattering, absorption, color distortion, and reduced visibility. To address such visual degradations, a variety of approaches have been proposed covering from basic signal processing methods to deep learning models; however, none of them has proven to be consistently successful. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model, Co-Operational Regressor Networks (CoRe-Nets), designed to achieve the best possible underwater image restoration. A CoRe-Net consists of two co-operating networks: the Apprentice Regressor (AR), responsible for image transformation, and the Master Regressor (MR), which evaluates the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the images generated by the AR and feeds it back to AR. CoRe-Nets are built on Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs), which offer a superior learning capability by modulating nonlinearity in kernel transformations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on the benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset. Leveraging the joint learning capabilities of the two cooperating networks, the proposed model achieves the state-of-art restoration performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and often presents such results that can even surpass the visual quality of the ground truth with a 2-pass application. Our results and the optimized PyTorch implementation of the proposed approach are now publicly shared on GitHub.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[LL-ICM: Image Compression for Low-level Machine Vision via Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03841v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Compression for Machines (ICM) aims to compress images for machine vision tasks rather than human viewing. Current works predominantly concentrate on high-level tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the quality of original images is usually not guaranteed in the real world, leading to even worse perceptual quality or downstream task performance after compression. Low-level (LL) machine vision models, like image restoration models, can help improve such quality, and thereby their compression requirements should also be considered. In this paper, we propose a pioneered ICM framework for LL machine vision tasks, namely LL-ICM. By jointly optimizing compression and LL tasks, the proposed LL-ICM not only enriches its encoding ability in generalizing to versatile LL tasks but also optimizes the processing ability of down-stream LL task models, achieving mutual adaptation for image codecs and LL task models. Furthermore, we integrate large-scale vision-language models into the LL-ICM framework to generate more universal and distortion-robust feature embeddings for LL vision tasks. Therefore, one LL-ICM codec can generalize to multiple tasks. We establish a solid benchmark to evaluate LL-ICM, which includes extensive objective experiments by using both full and no-reference image quality assessments. Experimental results show that LL-ICM can achieve 22.65% BD-rate reductions over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08688v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite previous image restoration (IR) methods have often concentrated on isolated degradations, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations involving a complex combination of multiple isolated degradations. However, current IR methods for composite degradations require building training data that contain an exponential number of possible degradation combinations, which brings in a significant burden. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new task setting, i.e. Universal Image Restoration (UIR). Specifically, UIR doesn't require training on all the degradation combinations but only on a set of degradation bases and then removing any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought that prompts large language models (LLMs) to address problems step-by-step, we propose Chain-of-Restoration (CoR) mechanism, which instructs models to remove unknown composite degradations step-by-step. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR can significantly improve model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving comparable or better results than those state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Transformer-Based Blind-Spot Network for Self-Supervised Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07846v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind-spot networks (BSN) have been prevalent neural architectures in self-supervised image denoising (SSID). However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial self-attention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-the-art SSID methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/nagejacob/TBSN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Segmentation Prior for Diffusion-Based Real-World Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02960v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) has achieved a remarkable leap by leveraging large-scale text-to-image models, enabling realistic image restoration from given recognition textual prompts. However, these methods sometimes fail to recognize some salient objects, resulting in inaccurate semantic restoration in these regions. Additionally, the same region may have a strong response to more than one prompt and it will lead to semantic ambiguity for image super-resolution. To alleviate the above two issues, in this paper, we propose to consider semantic segmentation as an additional control condition into diffusion-based image super-resolution. Compared to textual prompt conditions, semantic segmentation enables a more comprehensive perception of salient objects within an image by assigning class labels to each pixel. It also mitigates the risks of semantic ambiguities by explicitly allocating objects to their respective spatial regions. In practice, inspired by the fact that image super-resolution and segmentation can benefit each other, we propose SegSR which introduces a dual-diffusion framework to facilitate interaction between the image super-resolution and segmentation diffusion models. Specifically, we develop a Dual-Modality Bridge module to enable updated information flow between these two diffusion models, achieving mutual benefit during the reverse diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that SegSR can generate realistic images while preserving semantic structures more effectively.</p></details> |  |

Our approach focuses on effectively extracting non-contaminated features using a phase-based self-attention mechanism. We also introduce an optimized phase attention block to restore structural information by propagating prominent attentive features from the input. We evaluate our method on both synthetic (UIEB, UFO-120) and real-world (UIEB, U45, UCCS, SQUID) underwater image datasets.

Therefore, large-scale high-quality real-world training data is urgently needed to facilitate the emergence of foundational models for image restoration. To advance this field, we spare no effort in contributing a million-scale dataset with two notable advantages over existing training data: real-world samples with larger-scale, and degradation types with higher diversity. By adjusting internal camera settings and external imaging conditions, we can capture aligned image pairs using our well-designed data acquisition system over multiple rounds and our data alignment criterion. Moreover, we propose a robust model, FoundIR, to better address a broader range of restoration tasks in real-world scenarios, taking a further step toward foundation models. Specifically, we first utilize a diffusion-based generalist model to remove degradations by learning the degradation-agnostic common representations from diverse inputs, where incremental learning strategy is adopted to better guide model training. To refine the model's restoration capability in complex scenarios, we introduce degradation-aware specialist models for achieving final high-quality results.

Existing methods often depend on restrictive assumptions such as additional training, operator linearity, or narrow image distributions, thus limiting their generalizability. In this work, we present LADiBI, a training-free framework that uses large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to solve blind inverse problems with minimal assumptions. By leveraging natural language prompts, LADiBI jointly models priors for both the target image and operator, allowing for flexible adaptation across a variety of tasks. Additionally, we propose a novel posterior sampling approach that combines effective operator initialization with iterative refinement, enabling LADiBI to operate without predefined operator forms. Our experiments show that LADiBI is capable of solving a broad range of image restoration tasks, including both linear and nonlinear problems, on diverse target image distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptHSI: Universal Hyperspectral Image Restoration Framework for Composite Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15922v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in All-in-One (AiO) RGB image restoration and prompt learning have enabled the representation of distinct degradations through prompts, allowing degraded images to be effectively addressed by a single restoration model. However, this paradigm faces significant challenges when transferring to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks due to: 1) the domain gap between RGB and HSI features and difference on their structures, 2) information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and 3) difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation representations through text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework. By leveraging the frequency-aware feature modulation based on characteristics of HSI degradations, we decompose text prompts into intensity and bias controllers to effectively guide the restoration process while avoiding domain gaps. Our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance under various degradation combinations, indicating great potential for practical remote sensing applications. The source code and dataset will be publicly released.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Information Flow for Generalized Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18588v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision transformers show promise in numerous image restoration (IR) tasks, the challenge remains in efficiently generalizing and scaling up a model for multiple IR tasks. To strike a balance between efficiency and model capacity for a generalized transformer-based IR method, we propose a hierarchical information flow mechanism for image restoration, dubbed Hi-IR, which progressively propagates information among pixels in a bottom-up manner. Hi-IR constructs a hierarchical information tree representing the degraded image across three levels. Each level encapsulates different types of information, with higher levels encompassing broader objects and concepts and lower levels focusing on local details. Moreover, the hierarchical tree architecture removes long-range self-attention, improves the computational efficiency and memory utilization, thus preparing it for effective model scaling. Based on that, we explore model scaling to improve our method's capabilities, which is expected to positively impact IR in large-scale training settings. Extensive experimental results show that Hi-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, affirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance. The proposed MoCE-IR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, affirming its efficiency and practical applicability.

| **[Adaptive Blind All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18412v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind all-in-one image restoration models aim to recover a high-quality image from an input degraded with unknown distortions. However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration (ABAIR) model, which can address multiple degradations, generalizes well to unseen degradations, and efficiently incorporate new degradations by training a small fraction of parameters. First, we train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations, augmented with a segmentation head to estimate per-pixel degradation types, resulting in a powerful backbone able to generalize to a wide range of degradations. Second, we adapt our baseline model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. Our model is both powerful in handling specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks, it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on five- and three-task IR setups, but also shows improved generalization to unseen degradations and also composite distortions.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03463v2)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint. under review.

AWIR models are trained to address a specific set of weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow. But this causes them to often struggle with out-of-distribution (OoD) samples or unseen degradations which limits their effectiveness for real-world autonomous navigation. To overcome this issue, existing models must either be retrained or fine-tuned, both of which are inefficient and impractical, with retraining needing access to large datasets, and fine-tuning involving many parameters. In this paper, we propose using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt a pre-trained all-weather model to novel weather restoration tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LoRA lowers the performance of the adapted model on the pre-trained restoration tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a LoRA-based fine-tuning method called LoRA-Align (LoRA-A) which seeks to align the singular vectors of the fine-tuned and pre-trained weight matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This alignment helps preserve the model's knowledge of its original tasks while adapting it to unseen tasks. We show that images restored with LoRA and LoRA-A can be effectively used for computer vision tasks in autonomous navigation, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/loraapage/</p></details> |
| **[GenDeg: Diffusion-Based Degradation Synthesis for Generalizable All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17687v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based models for All-In-One Image Restoration (AIOR) have achieved significant advancements in recent years. However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on the implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/gendegpage/</p></details> |

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting detailed artifact maps. The absence of such quality metrics hinders accurate predictions of the quality of generated views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a new no-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution that is later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. We test and evaluate our method in the context of 3D reconstruction; to this end, we collected a novel dataset of human quality assessment in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method can not only successfully localize artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, but do so without direct references. Surprisingly, our metric outperforms both no-reference metrics and popular full-reference image metrics. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing weather restoration approaches are only capable of handling a specific type of degradation, which is often insufficient in real-world scenarios, such as rainy-snowy or rainy-hazy weather. Towards being able to address these situations, we propose a multi-weather Transformer, or MWFormer for short, which is a holistic vision Transformer that aims to solve multiple weather-induced degradations using a single, unified architecture. MWFormer uses hyper-networks and feature-wise linear modulation blocks to restore images degraded by various weather types using the same set of learned parameters. We first employ contrastive learning to train an auxiliary network that extracts content-independent, distortion-aware feature embeddings that efficiently represent predicted weather types, of which more than one may occur. Guided by these weather-informed predictions, the image restoration Transformer adaptively modulates its parameters to conduct both local and global feature processing, in response to multiple possible weather. Moreover, MWFormer allows for a novel way of tuning, during application, to either a single type of weather restoration or to hybrid weather restoration without any retraining, offering greater controllability than existing methods. Our experimental results on multi-weather restoration benchmarks show that MWFormer achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring much computational cost. Moreover, we demonstrate that our methodology of using hyper-networks can be integrated into various network architectures to further boost their performance.

| **[Text-guided Image Restoration and Semantic Enhancement for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09059v2)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is to retrieve specific person images according to the given textual descriptions. A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed Degradation Image Restoration via Local Dynamic Optimization and Conditional Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16217v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple-in-one image restoration (IR) has made significant progress, aiming to handle all types of single degraded image restoration with a single model. However, in real-world scenarios, images often suffer from combinations of multiple degradation factors. Existing multiple-in-one IR models encounter challenges related to degradation diversity and prompt singularity when addressing this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple-in-one IR model that can effectively restore images with both single and mixed degradations. To address degradation diversity, we design a Local Dynamic Optimization (LDO) module which dynamically processes degraded areas of varying types and granularities. To tackle the prompt singularity issue, we develop an efficient Conditional Feature Embedding (CFE) module that guides the decoder in leveraging degradation-type-related features, significantly improving the model's performance in mixed degradation restoration scenarios. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we introduce a new dataset containing both single and mixed degradation elements. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance not only on mixed degradation tasks but also on classic single-task restoration benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The video data obtained from these telescopes differ significantly from data for standard 3D reconstruction tasks, characterized by intense motion blur, atmospheric turbulence, pervasive background light pollution, extended focal length and constrained observational perspectives. To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We apply a customized Structure from Motion (SfM) approach, followed by an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, to achieve high-fidelity 3D model reconstruction. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station and International Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Unsupervised Underwater Neural Radiance Field U2NeRF, a transformer-based architecture that learns to render and restore novel views conditioned on multi-view geometry simultaneously. Due to the absence of supervision, we attempt to implicitly bake restoring capabilities onto the NeRF pipeline and disentangle the predicted color into several components - scene radiance, direct transmission map, backscatter transmission map, and global background light, and when combined reconstruct the underwater image in a self-supervised manner. In addition, we release an Underwater View Synthesis UVS dataset consisting of 12 underwater scenes, containing both synthetically-generated and real-world data. Our experiments demonstrate that when optimized on a single scene, U2NeRF outperforms several baselines by as much LPIPS 11%, UIQM 5%, UCIQE 4% (on average) and showcases improved rendering and restoration capabilities.

Unlike Retinex-based methods, our approach utilizes two color spaces - LAB and YUV - to efficiently separate and process color information, by leveraging the separation of luminance from chromatic components in color images. In addition, our model incorporates the Transformer architecture to comprehensively understand image content while maintaining computational efficiency. To dynamically balance the brightness in output images, we also introduce a Fourier transform module that adjusts the luminance channel in the frequency domain. This mechanism could uniformly balance brightness across different regions while eliminating background noises, and thereby enhancing visual quality. By combining these innovative components, LTCF-Net effectively improves low-light image quality while keeping the model lightweight. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics and datasets, achieving more natural color restoration and a balanced brightness distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient-Guided Parameter Mask for Multi-Scenario Image Restoration Under Adverse Weather](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16739v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Removing adverse weather conditions such as rain, raindrop, and snow from images is critical for various real-world applications, including autonomous driving, surveillance, and remote sensing. However, existing multi-task approaches typically rely on augmenting the model with additional parameters to handle multiple scenarios. While this enables the model to address diverse tasks, the introduction of extra parameters significantly complicates its practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-Guided Parameter Mask for Multi-Scenario Image Restoration under adverse weather, designed to effectively handle image degradation under diverse weather conditions without additional parameters. Our method segments model parameters into common and specific components by evaluating the gradient variation intensity during training for each specific weather condition. This enables the model to precisely and adaptively learn relevant features for each weather scenario, improving both efficiency and effectiveness without compromising on performance. This method constructs specific masks based on gradient fluctuations to isolate parameters influenced by other tasks, ensuring that the model achieves strong performance across all scenarios without adding extra parameters. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets. Specifically, our method achieves PSNR scores of 29.22 on the Raindrop dataset, 30.76 on the Rain dataset, and 29.56 on the Snow100K dataset.

However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images.

Existing acceleration sampling techniques, though seeking to expedite the process, inevitably sacrifice performance to some extent, resulting in over-blurry restored outcomes. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on three classical IR tasks, namely image super-resolution, image inpainting, and blind face restoration, \textit{\textbf{even only with four sampling steps}}.

When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by \textbf{even 0.35dB} PSNR for lightweight SR even with \textbf{9.3\% less} parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by \textbf{up to 0.29dB}.

Specifically, by establishing a direct correspondence between algorithm operators at each implementation step and network modules within each layer, one can rationally construct an almost ``white box'' network architecture with high interpretability. In this architecture, only the predefined component of the proximal operator, known as a proximal network, needs manual configuration, enabling the network to automatically extract intrinsic image priors in a data-driven manner. In current deep unfolding methods, such a proximal network is generally designed as a CNN architecture, whose necessity has been proven by a recent theory. That is, CNN structure substantially delivers the translational invariant image prior, which is the most universally possessed structural prior across various types of images. However, standard CNN-based proximal networks have essential limitations in capturing the rotation symmetry prior, another universal structural prior underlying general images. This leaves a large room for further performance improvement in deep unfolding approaches. To address this issue, this study makes efforts to suggest a high-accuracy rotation equivariant proximal network that effectively embeds rotation symmetry priors into the deep unfolding framework. Especially, we deduce, for the first time, the theoretical equivariant error for such a designed proximal network with arbitrary layers under arbitrary rotation degrees. This analysis should be the most refined theoretical conclusion for such error evaluation to date and is also indispensable for supporting the rationale behind such networks with intrinsic interpretability requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose TSFormer, an all-in-one framework that integrates \textbf{T}rusted learning with \textbf{S}parsification to boost both generalization capability and computational efficiency in UHD image restoration. The key is that only a small amount of token movement is allowed within the model. To efficiently filter tokens, we use Min-$p$ with random matrix theory to quantify the uncertainty of tokens, thereby improving the robustness of the model. Our model can run a 4K image in real time (40fps) with 3.38 M parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSFormer achieves state-of-the-art restoration quality while enhancing generalization and reducing computational demands. In addition, our token filtering method can be applied to other image restoration models to effectively accelerate inference and maintain performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, denoising diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis. Guided diffusion models, leveraging the potent generative priors of pre-trained models along with a differential guidance loss, have achieved promising results in blind image restoration. However, these models typically consider data consistency solely in the spatial domain, often resulting in distorted image content. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-aware guidance loss that can be integrated into various diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Our proposed guidance loss, based on 2D discrete wavelet transform, simultaneously enforces content consistency in both the spatial and frequency domains. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in three blind restoration tasks: blind image deblurring, imaging through turbulence, and blind restoration for multiple degradations. Notably, our method achieves a significant improvement in PSNR score, with a remarkable enhancement of 3.72\,dB in image deblurring. Moreover, our method exhibits superior capability in generating images with rich details and reduced distortion, leading to the best visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, has been accepted by the ECCV 2024: AIM workshop</p></details> |

However, because cataract patients may also suffer from other blinding eye diseases, ophthalmologists must diagnose them before surgery. The cloudy lens of cataract patients forms a hazy degeneration in the fundus images, making it challenging to observe the patient's fundus vessels, which brings difficulties to the diagnosis process. To address this issue, this paper establishes a new cataract image restoration method named Catintell. It contains a cataract image synthesizing model, Catintell-Syn, and a restoration model, Catintell-Res. Catintell-Syn uses GAN architecture with fully unsupervised data to generate paired cataract-like images with realistic style and texture rather than the conventional Gaussian degradation algorithm. Meanwhile, Catintell-Res is an image restoration network that can improve the quality of real cataract fundus images using the knowledge learned from synthetic cataract images. Extensive experiments show that Catintell-Res outperforms other cataract image restoration methods in PSNR with 39.03 and SSIM with 0.9476. Furthermore, the universal restoration ability that Catintell-Res gained from unpaired cataract images can process cataract images from various datasets. We hope the models can help ophthalmologists identify other blinding eye diseases of cataract patients and inspire more medical image restoration methods in the future.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various unknown degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different types of degradation, forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration plug-and-play method that generates parameters based on the input image and thus makes the model to adapt to specific degradation dynamically. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and All-in-One settings. Notably, our proposed model Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve a given small enough error, our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to mainstream embedding-based All-in-One methods.

| **[HAT: Hybrid Attention Transformer for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05239v2)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have shown impressive performance in image restoration tasks, such as image super-resolution and denoising. However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for better restoration, we propose a new Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines both channel attention and window-based self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a same-task pre-training strategy to further exploit the potential of the model for further improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We further scale up the model to show that the performance of the SR task can be greatly improved. Besides, we extend HAT to more image restoration applications, including real-world image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising and image compression artifacts reduction. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that our HAT achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Nevertheless, handling the complex and diverse degradations encountered in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To tackle this, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network. In the fine-tuning stage, we refine the pre-trained IR network through low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Built upon a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, LoRA-IR dynamically integrates multiple low-rank restoration experts through a degradation-guided router. This dynamic integration mechanism significantly enhances our model's adaptability to diverse and unknown degradations in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-IR achieves SOTA performance across 14 IR tasks and 29 benchmarks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Code and pre-trained models will be available at: https://github.com/shallowdream204/LoRA-IR.</p></details> |  |
| **[AllRestorer: All-in-One Transformer for Image Restoration under Composite Degradations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10708v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration models often face the simultaneous interaction of multiple degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing approaches typically handle single or composite degradations based on scene descriptors derived from text or image embeddings. However, due to the varying proportions of different degradations within an image, these scene descriptors may not accurately differentiate between degradations, leading to suboptimal restoration in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based restoration framework, AllRestorer. In AllRestorer, we enable the model to adaptively consider all image impairments, thereby avoiding errors from scene descriptor misdirection. Specifically, we introduce an All-in-One Transformer Block (AiOTB), which adaptively removes all degradations present in a given image by modeling the relationships between all degradations and the image embedding in latent space. To accurately address different variations potentially present within the same type of degradation and minimize ambiguity, AiOTB utilizes a composite scene descriptor consisting of both image and text embeddings to define the degradation. Furthermore, AiOTB includes an adaptive weight for each degradation, allowing for precise control of the restoration intensity. By leveraging AiOTB, AllRestorer avoids misdirection caused by inaccurate scene descriptors, achieving a 5.00 dB increase in PSNR compared to the baseline on the CDD-11 dataset.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

We propose the Probabilistic Prior Turbulence Removal Network (PPTRN), which combines probabilistic diffusion-based prior modeling with Transformer-driven feature extraction to address this issue. PPTRN employs a two-stage approach: first, a latent encoder and Transformer are jointly trained on clear images to establish robust feature representations. Then, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) models prior distributions over latent vectors, guiding the Transformer in capturing diverse feature variations essential for restoration. A key innovation in PPTRN is the Probabilistic Prior Driven Cross Attention mechanism, which integrates the DDPM-generated prior with feature embeddings to reduce artifacts and enhance spatial coherence. Extensive experiments validate that PPTRN significantly improves restoration quality on turbulence-degraded images, setting a new benchmark in clarity and structural fidelity.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 3 tables |

Current image restoration methods struggle to handle complex degradation while maintaining efficiency. This paper introduces a novel image restoration architecture that combines multi-dimensional dynamic attention and self-attention within a U-Net framework. To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks.

To this end, we develop an adaptive degradation-aware self-prompting model (ADSM) for all-in-one weather-degraded image restoration. Specifically, our model employs the contrastive language-image pre-training model (CLIP) to facilitate the training of our proposed latent prompt generators (LPGs), which represent three types of latent prompts to characterize the degradation type, degradation property and image caption. Moreover, we integrate the acquired degradation-aware prompts into the time embedding of diffusion model to improve degradation perception. Meanwhile, we employ the latent caption prompt to guide the reverse sampling process using the cross-attention mechanism, thereby guiding the accurate image reconstruction. Furthermore, to accelerate the reverse sampling procedure of diffusion model and address the limitations of frequency perception, we introduce a wavelet-oriented noise estimating network (WNE-Net). Extensive experiments conducted on eight publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both task-specific and all-in-one applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Frequency Enhancement Network for Blind Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06893v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image deblurring is an essential image preprocessing technique, aiming to recover clear and detailed images form blurry ones. However, existing algorithms often fail to effectively integrate multi-scale feature extraction with frequency enhancement, limiting their ability to reconstruct fine textures. Additionally, non-uniform blur in images also restricts the effectiveness of image restoration. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale frequency enhancement network (MFENet) for blind image deblurring. To capture the multi-scale spatial and channel information of blurred images, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction module (MS-FE) based on depthwise separable convolutions, which provides rich target features for deblurring. We propose a frequency enhanced blur perception module (FEBP) that employs wavelet transforms to extract high-frequency details and utilizes multi-strip pooling to perceive non-uniform blur, combining multi-scale information with frequency enhancement to improve the restoration of image texture details. Experimental results on the GoPro and HIDE datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior deblurring performance in both visual quality and objective evaluation metrics. Furthermore, in downstream object detection tasks, the proposed blind image deblurring algorithm significantly improves detection accuracy, further validating its effectiveness androbustness in the field of image deblurring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dropout the High-rate Downsampling: A Novel Design Paradigm for UHD Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06456v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the popularization of high-end mobile devices, Ultra-high-definition (UHD) images have become ubiquitous in our lives. The restoration of UHD images is a highly challenging problem due to the exaggerated pixel count, which often leads to memory overflow during processing. Existing methods either downsample UHD images at a high rate before processing or split them into multiple patches for separate processing. However, high-rate downsampling leads to significant information loss, while patch-based approaches inevitably introduce boundary artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel design paradigm to solve the UHD image restoration problem, called D2Net. D2Net enables direct full-resolution inference on UHD images without the need for high-rate downsampling or dividing the images into several patches. Specifically, we ingeniously utilize the characteristics of the frequency domain to establish long-range dependencies of features. Taking into account the richer local patterns in UHD images, we also design a multi-scale convolutional group to capture local features. Additionally, during the decoding stage, we dynamically incorporate features from the encoding stage to reduce the flow of irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on three UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring, show that our model achieves better quantitative and qualitative results than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | WACV2025 |
| **[A Modular Conditional Diffusion Framework for Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05993v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have been recently utilized to deal with various blind image restoration (IR) tasks, where they have demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of perceptual quality. However, the task-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational costs related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging to use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This hinders their wider adoption, especially by those who lack access to powerful computational resources and vast amount of training data. In this work we aim to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the performance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a relatively small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest. Moreover, the architecture of the proposed framework allows for a sampling strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function evaluations without suffering any performance loss, while it can also be combined with existing acceleration techniques such as DDIM. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality while it retains a competitive performance with respect to fidelity metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR) methods based on a pre-trained diffusion model have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, they have two fundamental limitations: 1) they often assume that the degradation operator is completely known and 2) they alter the diffusion sampling process, which may result in restored images that do not lie onto the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e, not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/hamadichihaoui/BIRD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2024</p></details> |

In this context, the key issue lies in how to deal with different types of degraded images simultaneously. In this work, we present a Degradation-Aware Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (DA-RCOT) approach that models (all-in-one) image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we formalize image restoration with a residual-guided OT objective by exploiting the degradation-specific patterns of the Fourier residual in the transport cost. More crucially, we design the transport map for restoration as a two-pass DA-RCOT map, in which the transport residual is computed in the first pass and then encoded as multi-scale residual embeddings to condition the second-pass restoration. This conditioning process injects intrinsic degradation knowledge (e.g., degradation type and level) and structural information from the multi-scale residual embeddings into the OT map, which thereby can dynamically adjust its behaviors for all-in-one restoration. Extensive experiments across five degradations demonstrate the favorable performance of DA-RCOT as compared to state-of-the-art methods, in terms of distortion measures, perceptual quality, and image structure preservation. Notably, DA-RCOT delivers superior adaptability to real-world scenarios even with multiple degradations and shows distinctive robustness to both degradation levels and the number of degradations.</p></details> |  |

This evaluation is pivotal in understanding the vulnerabilities of current UDC image restoration techniques. Following the assessment, we introduce a defense framework integrating adversarial purification with subsequent fine-tuning processes. First, our approach employs diffusion-based adversarial purification, effectively neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Then, we apply the fine-tuning methodologies to refine the image restoration models further, ensuring that the quality and fidelity of the restored images are maintained.

We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4x super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps.

This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed. Furthermore, regarding underwater image restoration, Aquatic-GS outperforms representative dewatering methods in color correction, detail recovery, and stability.

Meanwhile, researchers also proposed extremely compact, under-parameterized image priors (e.g., deep decoder) that are strikingly competent for image restoration too, despite a loss of accuracy. These two extremes push us to think whether there exists a better solution in the middle: between over- and under-parameterized image priors, can one identify "intermediate" parameterized image priors that achieve better trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and even preserving strong transferability? Drawing inspirations from the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), we conjecture and study a novel "lottery image prior" (LIP) by exploiting DNN inherent sparsity, stated as: given an over-parameterized DNN-based image prior, it will contain a sparse subnetwork that can be trained in isolation, to match the original DNN's performance when being applied as a prior to various image inverse problems. Our results validate the superiority of LIPs: we can successfully locate the LIP subnetworks from over-parameterized DIPs at substantial sparsity ranges. Those LIP subnetworks significantly outperform deep decoders under comparably compact model sizes (by often fully preserving the effectiveness of their over-parameterized counterparts), and they also possess high transferability across different images as well as restoration task types. Besides, we also extend LIP to compressive sensing image reconstruction, where a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the prior (in contrast to untrained DIP or deep decoder), and confirm its validity in this setting too. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that LTH is demonstrated to be relevant in the context of inverse problems or image priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Chasing-Better-DIPs</p></details> |

While reducing injected radiation dose mitigates this risk, it often compromises image quality. To reconstruct full-dose-quality images from low-dose scans, we propose a Cycle-constrained Adversarial Denoising Convolutional Network (Cycle-DCN). This model integrates a noise predictor, two discriminators, and a consistency network, and is optimized using a combination of supervised loss, adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, identity loss, and neighboring Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset consisting of raw PET brain data from 1,224 patients, acquired using a Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner. Each patient underwent a 120-seconds brain scan. To simulate low-dose PET conditions, images were reconstructed from shortened scan durations of 30, 12, and 5 seconds, corresponding to 1/4, 1/10, and 1/24 of the full-dose acquisition, respectively, using a custom-developed GPU-based image reconstruction software. The results show that Cycle-DCN significantly improves average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), SSIM, and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) across three dose levels, with improvements of up to 56%, 35%, and 71%, respectively. Additionally, it achieves contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) values that closely align with full-dose images, effectively preserving image details, tumor shape, and contrast, while resolving issues with blurred edges. The results of reader studies indicated that the images restored by Cycle-DCN consistently received the highest ratings from nuclear medicine physicians, highlighting their strong clinical relevance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Nevertheless, it encounters challenges related to ill-posed problems, resulting in deviations between single model predictions and ground-truths. Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning technique, aims to address these deviations by combining the predictions of multiple base models. Most existing works adopt ensemble learning during the design of restoration models, while only limited research focuses on the inference-stage ensemble of pre-trained restoration models. Regression-based methods fail to enable efficient inference, leading researchers in academia and industry to prefer averaging as their choice for post-training ensemble. To address this, we reformulate the ensemble problem of image restoration into Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and employ an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm to estimate ensemble weights for aggregating prediction candidates. We estimate the range-wise ensemble weights on a reference set and store them in a lookup table (LUT) for efficient ensemble inference on the test set. Our algorithm is model-agnostic and training-free, allowing seamless integration and enhancement of various pre-trained image restoration models. It consistently outperforms regression based methods and averaging ensemble approaches on 14 benchmarks across 3 image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring and deraining.

To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model. GenIR, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation & filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality images. Our second contribution, DreamClear, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restoration. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address. Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration.

However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. Hallucinations in these models create uncertainty about their reliability, raising major concerns about their practical application. This paper investigates this phenomenon through the lens of information theory, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through experiments with super-resolution and inpainting algorithms. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. Thus, we aim to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Deep Identity Learning (DIL), a novel learning strategy that includes a dedicated regularization term based on the properties of linear systems, to exploit the identity relation between the degradation and inverse degradation models. The salient aspect of our proposed framework is it neither relies on a deblurring dataset nor a single input blurry image (e.g. Polyblur, a self-supervised method). This framework detours the typical degradation kernel estimation step involved in most of the existing blind deblurring solutions by the proposition of our Random Kernel Gallery (RKG) dataset. The proposed approach extends our previous Image Super-Resolution (ISR) work, NSSR-DIL, to the image deblurring task. In this work, we updated the regularization term in DIL based on Fourier transform properties of the identity relation, to deliver robust performance across a wide range of degradations. Besides the regularization term, we provide an explicit and compact representation of the learned deep linear network in a matrix form, called Deep Restoration Kernel (DRK) to perform image restoration. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional and deep learning based deblurring methods, with at least an order of 100 lesser computational resources. The D3 model, both LCNN & DRK, can be effortlessly extended to the Image Super-Resolution (ISR) task as well to restore the low-resolution images with fine details. The D3 model and its kernel form representation (DRK) are lightweight yet robust and restore the blurry input in a fraction of a second.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real-ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real-ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model-based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps.

| **[Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900v4)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, images captured by high-mobility UAVs often suffer from motion blur cases, which significantly impedes the performance of advanced object detection algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative object detection algorithm specifically designed for blurry images, named DREB-Net (Dual-stream Restoration Embedding Blur-feature Fusion Network). First, DREB-Net addresses the particularities of blurry image object detection problem by incorporating a Blurry image Restoration Auxiliary Branch (BRAB) during the training phase. Second, it fuses the extracted shallow features via Multi-level Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (MAGFF) module, to extract richer features. Here, the MAGFF module comprises local attention modules and global attention modules, which assign different weights to the branches. Then, during the inference phase, the deep feature extraction of the BRAB can be removed to reduce computational complexity and improve detection speed. In loss function, a combined loss of MSE and SSIM is added to the BRAB to restore blurry images. Finally, DREB-Net introduces Fast Fourier Transform in the early stages of feature extraction, via a Learnable Frequency domain Amplitude Modulation Module (LFAMM), to adjust feature amplitude and enhance feature processing capability. Experimental results indicate that DREB-Net can still effectively perform object detection tasks under motion blur in captured images, showcasing excellent performance and broad application prospects. Our source code will be available at https://github.com/EEIC-Lab/DREB-Net.git.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Priors for Variational Likelihood Estimation and Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17521v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world noise removal is crucial in low-level computer vision. Due to the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent attention has shifted towards leveraging diffusion priors for image restoration tasks. However, existing diffusion priors-based methods either consider simple noise types or rely on approximate posterior estimation, limiting their effectiveness in addressing structured and signal-dependent noise commonly found in real-world images. In this paper, we build upon diffusion priors and propose adaptive likelihood estimation and MAP inference during the reverse diffusion process to tackle real-world noise. We introduce an independent, non-identically distributed likelihood combined with the noise precision (inverse variance) prior and dynamically infer the precision posterior using variational Bayes during the generation process. Meanwhile, we rectify the estimated noise variance through local Gaussian convolution. The final denoised image is obtained by propagating intermediate MAP solutions that balance the updated likelihood and diffusion prior. Additionally, we explore the local diffusion prior inherent in low-resolution diffusion models, enabling direct handling of high-resolution noisy images. Extensive experiments and analyses on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

| **[DaLPSR: Leverage Degradation-Aligned Language Prompt for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16477v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level. Related source codes and pre-trained parameters were public in https://github.com/puppy210/DaLPSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on All-in-One Image Restoration: Taxonomy, Evaluation and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15067v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) refers to the process of improving visual quality of images while removing degradation, such as noise, blur, weather effects, and so on. Traditional IR methods typically target specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance both convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this review, we delve into the AiOIR methodologies, emphasizing their architecture innovations and learning paradigm and offering a systematic review of prevalent approaches. We systematically categorize prevalent approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to advance this dynamic field. Our paper begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of cutting-edge designs based on factors such as prior knowledge and generalization capability. Next, we highlight key advancements in AiOIR, aiming to inspire further inquiry and innovation within the community. To facilitate a robust evaluation of existing methods, we collate and summarize commonly used datasets, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present an objective comparison of open-sourced methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners alike.

| **[Parameter Efficient Adaptation for Image Restoration with Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08881v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing single-task image restoration models for specific degradation has seen great success in recent years. To achieve generalized image restoration, all-in-one methods have recently been proposed and shown potential for multiple restoration tasks using one single model. Despite the promising results, the existing all-in-one paradigm still suffers from high computational costs as well as limited generalization on unseen degradations. In this work, we introduce an alternative solution to improve the generalization of image restoration models. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), we aim to tune only a small number of parameters to adapt pre-trained restoration models to various tasks. However, current PETL methods fail to generalize across varied restoration tasks due to their homogeneous representation nature. To this end, we propose AdaptIR, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with orthogonal multi-branch design to capture local spatial, global spatial, and channel representation bases, followed by adaptive base combination to obtain heterogeneous representation for different degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AdaptIR achieves stable performance on single-degradation tasks, and excels in hybrid-degradation tasks, with fine-tuning only 0.6% parameters for 8 hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Deep learning-based image restoration has emerged as a promising solution capable of generating high-resolution and motion-artifact-free MRI images from low-resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition times or from motion-artifact-corrupted images. To facilitate clinical integration, a time- and GPU-efficient network with reliable accuracy is essential. In this study, we adopted a unified 2D deep learning framework for pseudo-3D MRI image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) and motion artifact reduction (MAR). The optimal down-sampling factors to optimize the acquisition time in SRR were identified. Training for MAR was performed using publicly available in vivo data, employing a novel standardized method to induce motion artifacts of varying severity in a controlled way. The accuracy of the network was evaluated through a pixel-wise uncertainty map, and performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrated that the down-sampling factor of 1x1x2 for x2 acceleration and 2x2x2 for x4 acceleration was optimal. For SRR, the proposed TS-RCAN outperformed the 3D networks of mDCSRN and ReCNN, with an improvement of more than 0.01 in SSIM and 1.5 dB in PSNR while reducing GPU load by up to and inference time by up to 90%. For MAR, TS-RCAN exceeded UNet's performance by up to 0.014 in SSIM and 1.48 dB in PSNR. Additionally, TS-RCAN provided uncertainty information, which can be used to estimate the quality of the reconstructed images. TS-RCAN has potential use for SRR and MAR in the clinical setting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fusion from Decomposition: A Self-Supervised Approach for Image Fusion and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12274v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion is famous as an alternative solution to generate one high-quality image from multiple images in addition to image restoration from a single degraded image. The essence of image fusion is to integrate complementary information from source images. Existing fusion methods struggle with generalization across various tasks and often require labor-intensive designs, in which it is difficult to identify and extract useful information from source images due to the diverse requirements of each fusion task. Additionally, these methods develop highly specialized features for different downstream applications, hindering the adaptation to new and diverse downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFusion++, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to enhance the versatility of feature representation for different image fusion tasks. DeFusion++ captures the image fusion task-friendly representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way, overcoming the constraints of limited fusion datasets. Specifically, we introduce two innovative pretext tasks: common and unique decomposition (CUD) and masked feature modeling (MFM). CUD decomposes source images into abstract common and unique components, while MFM refines these components into robust fused features. Jointly training of these tasks enables DeFusion++ to produce adaptable representations that can effectively extract useful information from various source images, regardless of the fusion task. The resulting fused representations are also highly adaptable for a wide range of downstream tasks, including image segmentation and object detection. DeFusion++ stands out by producing versatile fused representations that can enhance both the quality of image fusion and the effectiveness of downstream high-level vision tasks, simplifying the process with the elegant fusion framework.</p></details> | 18page |

In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, dehazing, deblurring, desonwing, and deraining.

However, efforts to extend these advancements to video scenarios have been minimal, partly because of the absence of benchmarks that allow for a comprehensive and fair comparison. In this work, we first present a fair evaluation benchmark, in which we first introduce a Real-world Low-Quality Face Video benchmark (RFV-LQ), evaluate several leading image-based face restoration algorithms, and conduct a thorough systematical analysis of the benefits and challenges associated with extending blind face image restoration algorithms to degraded face videos. Our analysis identifies several key issues, primarily categorized into two aspects: significant jitters in facial components and noise-shape flickering between frames. To address these issues, we propose a Temporal Consistency Network (TCN) cooperated with alignment smoothing to reduce jitters and flickers in restored videos. TCN is a flexible component that can be seamlessly plugged into the most advanced face image restoration algorithms, ensuring the quality of image-based restoration is maintained as closely as possible.

However, existing restoration backbones often face the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation, hindering their application in practice. Recently, the Selective Structured State Space Model, especially the improved version Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a way to resolve the above dilemma. However, the standard Mamba still faces certain challenges in low-level vision such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In this work, we introduce a simple but effective baseline, named MambaIR, which introduces both local enhancement and channel attention to improve the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of the local pixel similarity and reduces the channel redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms SwinIR by up to 0.45dB on image SR, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field.

| **[A Preliminary Exploration Towards General Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15143v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the tremendous success of deep models in various individual image restoration tasks, there are at least two major technical challenges preventing these works from being applied to real-world usages: (1) the lack of generalization ability and (2) the complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing deep models, tailored for specific individual image restoration tasks, often fall short in effectively addressing these challenges. In this paper, we present a new problem called general image restoration (GIR) which aims to address these challenges within a unified model. GIR covers most individual image restoration tasks (\eg, image denoising, deblurring, deraining and super-resolution) and their combinations for general purposes. This paper proceeds to delineate the essential aspects of GIR, including problem definition and the overarching significance of generalization performance. Moreover, the establishment of new datasets and a thorough evaluation framework for GIR models is discussed. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing approaches for tackling the GIR challenge, illuminating their strengths and pragmatic challenges. By analyzing these approaches, we not only underscore the effectiveness of GIR but also highlight the difficulties in its practical implementation. At last, we also try to understand and interpret these models' behaviors to inspire the future direction. Our work can open up new valuable research directions and contribute to the research of general vision.</p></details> |  |

The requirement to tackle multiple degradations using the same model can lead to high-complexity designs with fixed configuration that lack the adaptability to more efficient alternatives. We propose DyNet, a dynamic family of networks designed in an encoder-decoder style for all-in-one image restoration tasks. Our DyNet can seamlessly switch between its bulkier and lightweight variants, thereby offering flexibility for efficient model deployment with a single round of training. This seamless switching is enabled by our weights-sharing mechanism, forming the core of our architecture and facilitating the reuse of initialized module weights. Further, to establish robust weights initialization, we introduce a dynamic pre-training strategy that trains variants of the proposed DyNet concurrently, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GPU hours. Our dynamic pre-training strategy eliminates the need for maintaining separate checkpoints for each variant, as all models share a common set of checkpoints, varying only in model depth. This efficient strategy significantly reduces storage overhead and enhances adaptability. To tackle the unavailability of large-scale dataset required in pre-training, we curate a high-quality, high-resolution image dataset named Million-IRD, having 2M image samples. We validate our DyNet for image denoising, deraining, and dehazing in all-in-one setting, achieving state-of-the-art results with 31.34\% reduction in GFlops and a 56.75\% reduction in parameters compared to baseline models.

| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image restoration algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[TANet: Triplet Attention Network for All-In-One Adverse Weather Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08177v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather image restoration aims to remove unwanted degraded artifacts, such as haze, rain, and snow, caused by adverse weather conditions. Existing methods achieve remarkable results for addressing single-weather conditions. However, they face challenges when encountering unpredictable weather conditions, which often happen in real-world scenarios. Although different weather conditions exhibit different degradation patterns, they share common characteristics that are highly related and complementary, such as occlusions caused by degradation patterns, color distortion, and contrast attenuation due to the scattering of atmospheric particles. Therefore, we focus on leveraging common knowledge across multiple weather conditions to restore images in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose a Triplet Attention Network (TANet) to efficiently and effectively address all-in-one adverse weather image restoration. TANet consists of Triplet Attention Block (TAB) that incorporates three types of attention mechanisms: Local Pixel-wise Attention (LPA) and Global Strip-wise Attention (GSA) to address occlusions caused by non-uniform degradation patterns, and Global Distribution Attention (GDA) to address color distortion and contrast attenuation caused by atmospheric phenomena. By leveraging common knowledge shared across different weather conditions, TANet successfully addresses multiple weather conditions in a unified manner. Experimental results show that TANet efficiently and effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance in all-in-one adverse weather image restoration.

Despite the impressive results achieved by these I2I models, their practical utility is hampered by their large model size and the computational burden of the iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel compression method tailored for diffusion-based I2I models. Based on the observations that the image conditions of I2I models already provide rich information on image structures, and that the time steps with a larger impact tend to be biased, we develop surprisingly simple yet effective approaches for reducing the model size and latency. We validate the effectiveness of our method on three representative I2I tasks: InstructPix2Pix for image editing, StableSR for image restoration, and ControlNet for image-conditional image generation. Our approach achieves satisfactory output quality with 39.2%, 56.4% and 39.2% reduction in model footprint, as well as 81.4%, 68.7% and 31.1% decrease in latency to InstructPix2Pix, StableSR and ControlNet, respectively.</p></details> | ACCV 2024 |

An effective strategy is to incorporate prior knowledge, either from human input or generative model. In this paper, we introduce Instant-reference Image Restoration (InstantIR), a novel diffusion-based BIR method which dynamically adjusts generation condition during inference. We first extract a compact representation of the input via a pre-trained vision encoder. At each generation step, this representation is used to decode current diffusion latent and instantiate it in the generative prior. The degraded image is then encoded with this reference, providing robust generation condition. We observe the variance of generative references fluctuate with degradation intensity, which we further leverage as an indicator for developing a sampling algorithm adaptive to input quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate InstantIR achieves state-of-the-art performance and offering outstanding visual quality. Through modulating generative references with textual description, InstantIR can restore extreme degradation and additionally feature creative restoration.</p></details> |  |

Despite the outstanding performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted the application of image restoration. To lift the restriction, it is required to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning approaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint. However, it fails to account for different computational complexities and performance requirements for different layers of an image restoration network. To further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the restoration accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method which outperforms previous pruning methods significantly. PyTorch implementation for the proposed methods is available at https://github.com/JungHunOh/SLS_CVPR2022.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2022</p></details> |
| **[ReFIR: Grounding Large Restoration Models with Retrieval Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05601v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based Large Restoration Models (LRMs) have significantly improved photo-realistic image restoration by leveraging the internal knowledge embedded within model weights. However, existing LRMs often suffer from the hallucination dilemma, i.e., producing incorrect contents or textures when dealing with severe degradations, due to their heavy reliance on limited internal knowledge. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal solution called the Retrieval-augmented Framework for Image Restoration (ReFIR), which incorporates retrieved images as external knowledge to extend the knowledge boundary of existing LRMs in generating details faithful to the original scene. Specifically, we first introduce the nearest neighbor lookup to retrieve content-relevant high-quality images as reference, after which we propose the cross-image injection to modify existing LRMs to utilize high-quality textures from retrieved images. Thanks to the additional external knowledge, our ReFIR can well handle the hallucination challenge and facilitate faithfully results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFIR can achieve not only high-fidelity but also realistic restoration results. Importantly, our ReFIR requires no training and is adaptable to various LRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the significant superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

| **[SITCOM: Step-wise Triple-Consistent Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04479v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative models that allow sampling from a distribution learned over a training set. When applied to solving inverse imaging problems (IPs), the reverse sampling steps of DMs are typically modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution in the image space. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (such as in the presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier sampling steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces the standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions, either implicitly or explicitly, our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our accelerated method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, under different levels of measurement noise, our extensive experiments across five linear and three non-linear image restoration tasks demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard image similarity metrics while requiring a significantly reduced run-time across all considered tasks.</p></details> |  |

Three popular SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models are first introduced, including variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and the associated literature review of recent efforts are elucidated. Then, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed by incorporating the cutting-edge GAI technology-large language models (LLMs). This system features two LLM-based AI agents at both the transmitter and receiver, serving as "brains" to enable powerful information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. This innovative design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content, instead of recovering the bit stream, based on the coded semantic information conveyed by the transmitter. Therefore, it shifts the communication mindset from "information recovery" to "information regeneration" and thus ushers in a new era of generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed generative SemCom system, showcasing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to the traditional communication system. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are delineated, followed by a discussion of three open issues warranting future investigation. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, paving the way for the efficient implementation of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

As diffusion models scale up, these methods become impractical. To address this challenge, we propose DMin (Diffusion Model influence), a scalable framework for estimating the influence of each training data sample on a given generated image. By leveraging efficient gradient compression and retrieval techniques, DMin reduces storage requirements from 339.39 TB to only 726 MB and retrieves the top-k most influential training samples in under 1 second, all while maintaining performance. Our empirical results demonstrate DMin is both effective in identifying influential training samples and efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables.

A vital issue that must be addressed is the generation of energy from non-renewable and often polluting sources. For this reason, the development of renewable energy sources is of great importance. Unfortunately, too rapid spread of renewables can disrupt stability of the power system and lead to energy blackouts. One should not simply support it, without ensuring sustainability and understanding of the diffusion process. In this research, we propose a new agent-based model of diffusion of photovoltaic panels. It is an extension of the q-voter model that utilizes multi-layer network structure. The novelty is studying both opinion dynamics and diffusion of innovation simultaneously, on a multidimensional structure. The model is analyzed with Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field approximation. The impact of parameters and specifications on the basic properties of the model is discussed. Firstly, we show that for a certain range of parameters, innovation always succeeds, regardless of the initial conditions. Secondly, that the mean-field approximation gives qualitatively the same results as computer simulations, even though it does not utilize knowledge of the network structure.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address the challenge of generating high-fidelity tiled garment images essential for personalized recommendations, outfit composition, and virtual try-on systems from photos of garments worn by models. Inspired by the success of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in image-to-image translation, we propose a novel approach utilizing a fine-tuned StableDiffusion model. Our method features a streamlined single-stage network design, which integrates garmentspecific masks to isolate and process target clothing items effectively. By simplifying the network architecture through selective training of transformer blocks and removing unnecessary crossattention layers, we significantly reduce computational complexity while achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets like VITON-HD. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing high-quality tiled garment images for both full-body and half-body inputs.

However, prior methods often distort fine-grained textural details from the reference image, despite achieving high overall image quality. We attribute these distortions to inadequate attention to corresponding regions in the reference image. To address this, we thereby propose learning flow fields in attention (Leffa), which explicitly guides the target query to attend to the correct reference key in the attention layer during training. Specifically, it is realized via a regularization loss on top of the attention map within a diffusion-based baseline. Our extensive experiments show that Leffa achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling appearance (virtual try-on) and pose (pose transfer), significantly reducing fine-grained detail distortion while maintaining high image quality. Additionally, we show that our loss is model-agnostic and can be used to improve the performance of other diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>githu...</summary><p>github: https://github.com/franciszzj/Leffa, demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/franciszzj/Leffa, model: https://huggingface.co/franciszzj/Leffa</p></details> |
| **[InvDiff: Invariant Guidance for Bias Mitigation in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08480v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most successful generative models, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in synthesizing high-quality images. These models learn the underlying high-dimensional data distribution in an unsupervised manner. Despite their success, diffusion models are highly data-driven and prone to inheriting the imbalances and biases present in real-world data. Some studies have attempted to address these issues by designing text prompts for known biases or using bias labels to construct unbiased data. While these methods have shown improved results, real-world scenarios often contain various unknown biases, and obtaining bias labels is particularly challenging. In this paper, we emphasize the necessity of mitigating bias in pre-trained diffusion models without relying on auxiliary bias annotations. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework, InvDiff, which aims to learn invariant semantic information for diffusion guidance. Specifically, we propose identifying underlying biases in the training data and designing a novel debiasing training objective. Then, we employ a lightweight trainable module that automatically preserves invariant semantic information and uses it to guide the diffusion model's sampling process toward unbiased outcomes simultaneously. Notably, we only need to learn a small number of parameters in the lightweight learnable module without altering the pre-trained diffusion model. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that the implementation of InvDiff is equivalent to reducing the error upper bound of generalization. Extensive experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that InvDiff effectively reduces biases while maintaining the quality of image generation.

However, most existing synthesis methods for natural images prioritize foreground control, often reducing the background to plain textures. This neglects the interaction between foreground and background, which can lead to incoherence in RS scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CC-Diff, a Diffusion Model-based approach for RS image generation with enhanced Context Coherence. To capture spatial interdependence, we propose a sequential pipeline where background generation is conditioned on synthesized foreground instances. Distinct learnable queries are also employed to model both the complex background texture and its semantic relation to the foreground. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CC-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and positional precision, excelling in both RS and natural image domains. CC-Diff also shows strong trainability, improving detection accuracy by 2.04 mAP on DOTA and 2.25 mAP on the COCO benchmark.</p></details> |  |

During manufacturing, variations in material and process parameters can significantly influence the exact fiber orientation. We employ multilevel polynomial surrogates to model the propagation of uncertain material properties in the injection molding process. To ensure reliable uncertainty quantification, a key focus is deriving novel error bounds for statistical measures of a quantity of interest, computed via these surrogates. To verify these bounds, we conduct numerical experiments using the Cross-WLF viscosity model alongside the Hagen-Poiseuille flow in a rectangular channel. In particular, the impact of uncertainties in fiber length and matrix temperature on the fractional anisotropy of fiber orientation is investigated. The Folgar-Tucker equation and the improved anisotropic rotary diffusion model are used, incorporating recently established analytical solutions of these models as part of our verification. Our results demonstrate that the investigated method significantly improves upon standard Monte Carlo estimation, while also providing error guarantees. These findings offer the first step toward a reliable and practical tool for optimizing fiber-reinforced polymer manufacturing processes in the future.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving temporal stability when generalizing to longer rollout horizons remains a persistent challenge for learned PDE solvers. In this work, we analyze if fully data-driven fluid solvers that utilize an autoregressive rollout based on conditional diffusion models are a viable option to address this challenge. We investigate accuracy, posterior sampling, spectral behavior, and temporal stability, while requiring that methods generalize to flow parameters beyond the training regime. To quantitatively and qualitatively benchmark the performance of various flow prediction approaches, three challenging 2D scenarios including incompressible and transonic flows, as well as isotropic turbulence are employed. We find that even simple diffusion-based approaches can outperform multiple established flow prediction methods in terms of accuracy and temporal stability, while being on par with state-of-the-art stabilization techniques like unrolling at training time. Such traditional architectures are superior in terms of inference speed, however, the probabilistic nature of diffusion approaches allows for inferring multiple predictions that align with the statistics of the underlying physics. Overall, our benchmark contains three carefully chosen data sets that are suitable for probabilistic evaluation alongside various established flow prediction architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available at https://github.com/tum-pbs/autoreg-pde-diffusion and further information and videos at https://ge.in.tum.de/publications/2023-acdm-kohl</p></details> |

Recent methods propose to predict implicit representations directly from unposed inputs in a data-driven manner, achieving promising results. However, these methods do not utilize geometric priors and cannot hallucinate the appearance of unseen regions, thus making it challenging to reconstruct fine geometric and textural details. To tackle this challenge, our key idea is to reformulate this ill-posed problem as conditional novel view synthesis, aiming to generate complete observations from limited input views to facilitate reconstruction. With complete observations, the poses of the input views can be easily recovered and further used to optimize the reconstructed object. To this end, we propose a novel pipeline Pragmatist. First, we generate a complete observation of the object via a multiview conditional diffusion model. Then, we use a feed-forward large reconstruction model to obtain the reconstructed mesh. To further improve the reconstruction quality, we recover the poses of input views by inverting the obtained 3D representations and further optimize the texture using detailed input views. Unlike previous approaches, our pipeline improves reconstruction by efficiently leveraging unposed inputs and generative priors, circumventing the direct resolution of highly ill-posed problems. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves promising performance in several benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025. 13 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

An approach to solve this problem is to leverage simulation to create large datasets of pairs of objects and grasp poses, and then learn a conditional generative model that can be prompted quickly during deployment. However, the grasp pose data is highly multimodal since there are several ways to grasp an object. Hence, in this work, we learn a grasp generative model with diffusion models to sample candidate grasp poses given a partial point cloud of an object. A novel aspect of our method is to consider diffusion in the manifold space of rotations and to propose a collision-avoidance cost guidance to improve the grasp success rate during inference. To accelerate grasp sampling we use recent techniques from the diffusion literature to achieve faster inference times. We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our approach can grasp several objects from raw depth images with $90\%$ success rate and benchmark it against several baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counting Guidance for High Fidelity Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17567v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been significant improvements in the quality and performance of text-to-image generation, largely due to the impressive results attained by diffusion models. However, text-to-image diffusion models sometimes struggle to create high-fidelity content for the given input prompt. One specific issue is their difficulty in generating the precise number of objects specified in the text prompt. For example, when provided with the prompt "five apples and ten lemons on a table," images generated by diffusion models often contain an incorrect number of objects. In this paper, we present a method to improve diffusion models so that they accurately produce the correct object count based on the input prompt. We adopt a counting network that performs reference-less class-agnostic counting for any given image. We calculate the gradients of the counting network and refine the predicted noise for each step. To address the presence of multiple types of objects in the prompt, we utilize novel attention map guidance to obtain high-quality masks for each object. Finally, we guide the denoising process using the calculated gradients for each object. Through extensive experiments and evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the fidelity of diffusion models with respect to object count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Model Patching via Mixture-of-Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17825v3)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Diffusion Model Patching (DMP), a simple method to boost the performance of pre-trained diffusion models that have already reached convergence, with a negligible increase in parameters. DMP inserts a small, learnable set of prompts into the model's input space while keeping the original model frozen. The effectiveness of DMP is not merely due to the addition of parameters but stems from its dynamic gating mechanism, which selects and combines a subset of learnable prompts at every timestep (i.e., reverse denoising steps). This strategy, which we term "mixture-of-prompts", enables the model to draw on the distinct expertise of each prompt, essentially "patching" the model's functionality at every timestep with minimal yet specialized parameters. Uniquely, DMP enhances the model by further training on the original dataset already used for pre-training, even in a scenario where significant improvements are typically not expected due to model convergence. Notably, DMP significantly enhances the FID of converged DiT-L/2 by 10.38% on FFHQ, achieved with only a 1.43% parameter increase and 50K additional training iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025; Project: https://sangminwoo.github.io/DMP/</p></details> |
| **[Digging into Intrinsic Contextual Information for High-fidelity 3D Point Cloud Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08326v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The common occurrence of occlusion-induced incompleteness in point clouds has made point cloud completion (PCC) a highly-concerned task in the field of geometric processing. Existing PCC methods typically produce complete point clouds from partial point clouds in a coarse-to-fine paradigm, with the coarse stage generating entire shapes and the fine stage improving texture details. Though diffusion models have demonstrated effectiveness in the coarse stage, the fine stage still faces challenges in producing high-fidelity results due to the ill-posed nature of PCC. The intrinsic contextual information for texture details in partial point clouds is the key to solving the challenge. In this paper, we propose a high-fidelity PCC method that digs into both short and long-range contextual information from the partial point cloud in the fine stage. Specifically, after generating the coarse point cloud via a diffusion-based coarse generator, a mixed sampling module introduces short-range contextual information from partial point clouds into the fine stage. A surface freezing modules safeguards points from noise-free partial point clouds against disruption. As for the long-range contextual information, we design a similarity modeling module to derive similarity with rigid transformation invariance between points, conducting effective matching of geometric manifold features globally. In this way, the high-quality components present in the partial point cloud serve as valuable references for refining the coarse point cloud with high fidelity. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over SOTA competitors.

Removing motion artifacts is a straightforward solution and has been extensively studied. However, paired data are still heavily relied on in recent works and the perturbations in k-space (frequency domain) are not well considered, which limits their applications in the clinical field. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised purification method which leverages pixel-frequency information of noisy MRI images to guide a pre-trained diffusion model to recover clean MRI images. Specifically, considering that motion artifacts are mainly concentrated in high-frequency components in k-space, we utilize the low-frequency components as the guide to ensure correct tissue textures. Additionally, given that high-frequency and pixel information are helpful for recovering shape and detail textures, we design alternate complementary masks to simultaneously destroy the artifact structure and exploit useful information. Quantitative experiments are performed on datasets from different tissues and show that our method achieves superior performance on several metrics. Qualitative evaluations with radiologists also show that our method provides better clinical feedback.

| **[GDSG: Graph Diffusion-based Solution Generation for Optimization Problems in MEC Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08296v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization is crucial for MEC networks to function efficiently and reliably, most of which are NP-hard and lack efficient approximation algorithms. This leads to a paucity of optimal solution, constraining the effectiveness of conventional deep learning approaches. Most existing learning-based methods necessitate extensive optimal data and fail to exploit the potential benefits of suboptimal data that can be obtained with greater efficiency and effectiveness. Taking the multi-server multi-user computation offloading (MSCO) problem, which is widely observed in systems like Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, as a concrete scenario, we present a Graph Diffusion-based Solution Generation (GDSG) method. This approach is designed to work with suboptimal datasets while converging to the optimal solution large probably. We transform the optimization issue into distribution-learning and offer a clear explanation of learning from suboptimal training datasets. We build GDSG as a multi-task diffusion model utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to acquire the distribution of high-quality solutions. We use a simple and efficient heuristic approach to obtain a sufficient amount of training data composed entirely of suboptimal solutions. In our implementation, we enhance the backbone GNN and achieve improved generalization. GDSG also reaches nearly 100\% task orthogonality, ensuring no interference between the discrete and continuous generation tasks. We further reveal that this orthogonality arises from the diffusion-related training loss, rather than the neural network architecture itself. The experiments demonstrate that GDSG surpasses other benchmark methods on both the optimal and suboptimal training datasets. The MSCO datasets has open-sourced at http://ieee-dataport.org/13824, as well as the GDSG algorithm codes at https://github.com/qiyu3816/GDSG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Refining Diffusion Samplers: Enabling Parallelization via Parareal Iterations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08292v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In diffusion models, samples are generated through an iterative refinement process, requiring hundreds of sequential model evaluations. Several recent methods have introduced approximations (fewer discretization steps or distillation) to trade off speed at the cost of sample quality. In contrast, we introduce Self-Refining Diffusion Samplers (SRDS) that retain sample quality and can improve latency at the cost of additional parallel compute. We take inspiration from the Parareal algorithm, a popular numerical method for parallel-in-time integration of differential equations. In SRDS, a quick but rough estimate of a sample is first created and then iteratively refined in parallel through Parareal iterations. SRDS is not only guaranteed to accurately solve the ODE and converge to the serial solution but also benefits from parallelization across the diffusion trajectory, enabling batched inference and pipelining. As we demonstrate for pre-trained diffusion models, the early convergence of this refinement procedure drastically reduces the number of steps required to produce a sample, speeding up generation for instance by up to 1.7x on a 25-step StableDiffusion-v2 benchmark and up to 4.3x on longer trajectories.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Toward Near-Globally Optimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08278v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving global optimality in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problem. Since commonly employed local optimization techniques depend on carefully chosen initial guesses, this non-convexity often leads to suboptimal performance resulting from local optima. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion model-based approach for near-globally optimal NMPC consisting of an offline and an online phase. The offline phase employs a local optimizer to sample from the distribution of optimal NMPC control sequences along generated system trajectories through random initial guesses. Subsequently, the generated diverse data set is used to train a diffusion model to reflect the multi-modal distribution of optima. In the online phase, the trained model is leveraged to efficiently perform a variant of random shooting optimization to obtain near-globally optimal control sequences without relying on any initial guesses or online NMPC solving. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated in a numerical simulation indicating high performance benefits compared to direct neural network approximations of NMPC and significantly lower computation times than online solving NMPC using global optimizers.</p></details> |  |

Understanding this data evolution is important for model development and interpretability, yet challenging due to its high-dimensional, iterative nature. Prior works often focus on static or instance-level analyses, missing the iterative and holistic aspects of the generative path. While dimensionality reduction can visualize image evolution for few instances, it does preserve the iterative structure. To address these gaps, we introduce EvolvED, a method that presents a holistic view of the iterative generative process in diffusion models. EvolvED goes beyond instance exploration by leveraging predefined research questions to streamline generative space exploration. Tailored prompts aligned with these questions are used to extract intermediate images, preserving iterative context. Targeted feature extractors trace the evolution of key image attribute evolution, addressing the complexity of high-dimensional outputs. Central to EvolvED is a novel evolutionary embedding algorithm that encodes iterative steps while maintaining semantic relations. It enhances the visualization of data evolution by clustering semantically similar elements within each iteration with t-SNE, grouping elements by iteration, and aligning an instance's elements across iterations. We present rectilinear and radial layouts to represent iterations and support exploration.

However, can gradient perturbation protection mechanisms truly defend against all gradient leakage attacks? In this paper, we present the first attempt to break the shield of gradient perturbation protection in Federated Learning for the extraction of private information. We focus on common noise distributions, specifically Gaussian and Laplace, and apply our approach to DNN and CNN models. We introduce Mjolnir, a perturbation-resilient gradient leakage attack that is capable of removing perturbations from gradients without requiring additional access to the original model structure or external data. Specifically, we leverage the inherent diffusion properties of gradient perturbation protection to develop a novel diffusion-based gradient denoising model for Mjolnir. By constructing a surrogate client model that captures the structure of perturbed gradients, we obtain crucial gradient data for training the diffusion model. We further utilize the insight that monitoring disturbance levels during the reverse diffusion process can enhance gradient denoising capabilities, allowing Mjolnir to generate gradients that closely approximate the original, unperturbed versions through adaptive sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mjolnir effectively recovers the protected gradients and exposes the Federated Learning process to the threat of gradient leakage, achieving superior performance in gradient denoising and private data recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Unicorn: Unified Neural Image Compression with One Number Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08210v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalent lossy image compression schemes can be divided into: 1) explicit image compression (EIC), including traditional standards and neural end-to-end algorithms; 2) implicit image compression (IIC) based on implicit neural representations (INR). The former is encountering impasses of either leveling off bitrate reduction at a cost of tremendous complexity while the latter suffers from excessive smoothing quality as well as lengthy decoder models. In this paper, we propose an innovative paradigm, which we dub \textbf{Unicorn} (\textbf{U}nified \textbf{N}eural \textbf{I}mage \textbf{C}ompression with \textbf{O}ne \textbf{N}number \textbf{R}econstruction). By conceptualizing the images as index-image pairs and learning the inherent distribution of pairs in a subtle neural network model, Unicorn can reconstruct a visually pleasing image from a randomly generated noise with only one index number. The neural model serves as the unified decoder of images while the noises and indexes corresponds to explicit representations. As a proof of concept, we propose an effective and efficient prototype of Unicorn based on latent diffusion models with tailored model designs. Quantitive and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our prototype achieves significant bitrates reduction compared with EIC and IIC algorithms. More impressively, benefitting from the unified decoder, our compression ratio escalates as the quantity of images increases. We envision that more advanced model designs will endow Unicorn with greater potential in image compression. We will release our codes in \url{https://github.com/uniqzheng/Unicorn-Laduree}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hidden in the Noise: Two-Stage Robust Watermarking for Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04653v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques. In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Inpainting via Tractable Steering of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03349v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are the current state of the art for generating photorealistic images. Controlling the sampling process for constrained image generation tasks such as inpainting, however, remains challenging since exact conditioning on such constraints is intractable. While existing methods use various techniques to approximate the constrained posterior, this paper proposes to exploit the ability of Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) to exactly and efficiently compute the constrained posterior, and to leverage this signal to steer the denoising process of diffusion models. Specifically, this paper adopts a class of expressive TPMs termed Probabilistic Circuits (PCs). Building upon prior advances, we further scale up PCs and make them capable of guiding the image generation process of diffusion models. Empirical results suggest that our approach can consistently improve the overall quality and semantic coherence of inpainted images across three natural image datasets (i.e., CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and LSUN) with only $\sim\! 10 \%$ additional computational overhead brought by the TPM. Further, with the help of an image encoder and decoder, our method can readily accept semantic constraints on specific regions of the image, which opens up the potential for more controlled image generation tasks. In addition to proposing a new framework for constrained image generation, this paper highlights the benefit of more tractable models and motivates the development of expressive TPMs.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods optimize the latent embedding for each type of score function with longer diffusion steps, making the generation process time-consuming and limiting their flexibility and use. This work presents Ctrl-X, a simple framework for T2I diffusion controlling structure and appearance without additional training or guidance. Ctrl-X designs feed-forward structure control to enable the structure alignment with a structure image and semantic-aware appearance transfer to facilitate the appearance transfer from a user-input image. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments illustrate the superior performance of Ctrl-X on various condition inputs and model checkpoints. In particular, Ctrl-X supports novel structure and appearance control with arbitrary condition images of any modality, exhibits superior image quality and appearance transfer compared to existing works, and provides instant plug-and-play functionality to any T2I and text-to-video (T2V) diffusion model.

While it has achieved notable advancements in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, their application in speech generation remains under-explored. Mainstream Text-to-Speech systems primarily map outputs to Mel-Spectrograms in the spectral space, leading to high computational loads due to the sparsity of MelSpecs. To address these limitations, we propose LatentSpeech, a novel TTS generation approach utilizing latent diffusion models. By using latent embeddings as the intermediate representation, LatentSpeech reduces the target dimension to 5% of what is required for MelSpecs, simplifying the processing for the TTS encoder and vocoder and enabling efficient high-quality speech generation. This study marks the first integration of latent diffusion models in TTS, enhancing the accuracy and naturalness of generated speech. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LatentSpeech achieves a 25% improvement in Word Error Rate and a 24% improvement in Mel Cepstral Distortion compared to existing models, with further improvements rising to 49.5% and 26%, respectively, with additional training data. These findings highlight the potential of LatentSpeech to advance the state-of-the-art in TTS technology</p></details> |  |

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based oil spill segmentation offers robust monitoring under various conditions but faces challenges due to the limited labeled data and inherent speckle noise in SAR imagery. To address these issues, we propose (i) a diffusion-based Data Augmentation and Knowledge Distillation (DAKD) pipeline and (ii) a novel SAR oil spill segmentation network, called SAROSS-Net. In our DAKD pipeline, we present a diffusion-based SAR-JointNet that learns to generate realistic SAR images and their labels for segmentation, by effectively modeling joint distribution with balancing two modalities. The DAKD pipeline augments the training dataset and distills knowledge from SAR-JointNet by utilizing generated soft labels (pixel-wise probability maps) to supervise our SAROSS-Net. The SAROSS-Net is designed to selectively transfer high-frequency features from noisy SAR images, by employing novel Context-Aware Feature Transfer blocks along skip connections. We demonstrate our SAR-JointNet can generate realistic SAR images and well-aligned segmentation labels, providing the augmented data to train SAROSS-Net with enhanced generalizability. Our SAROSS-Net trained with the DAKD pipeline significantly outperforms existing SAR oil spill segmentation methods with large margins.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Diffusion Prior for Image Super-Resolution with Domain Shift SDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17778v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) models have attracted substantial interest due to their powerful image restoration capabilities. However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

AiM employs Mamba, a novel state-space model characterized by its exceptional performance for long-sequence modeling with linear time complexity, to supplant the commonly utilized Transformers in AR image generation models, aiming to achieve both superior generation quality and enhanced inference speed. Unlike existing methods that adapt Mamba to handle two-dimensional signals via multi-directional scan, AiM directly utilizes the next-token prediction paradigm for autoregressive image generation. This approach circumvents the need for extensive modifications to enable Mamba to learn 2D spatial representations. By implementing straightforward yet strategically targeted modifications for visual generative tasks, we preserve Mamba's core structure, fully exploiting its efficient long-sequence modeling capabilities and scalability. We provide AiM models in various scales, with parameter counts ranging from 148M to 1.3B. On the ImageNet1K 256*256 benchmark, our best AiM model achieves a FID of 2.21, surpassing all existing AR models of comparable parameter counts and demonstrating significant competitiveness against diffusion models, with 2 to 10 times faster inference speed.

| **[Map Optical Properties to Subwavelength Structures Directly via a Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05959v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subwavelength photonic structures and metamaterials provide revolutionary approaches for controlling light. The inverse design methods proposed for these subwavelength structures are vital to the development of new photonic devices. However, most of the existing inverse design methods cannot realize direct mapping from optical properties to photonic structures but instead rely on forward simulation methods to perform iterative optimization. In this work, we exploit the powerful generative abilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and propose a practical inverse design method based on latent diffusion models. Our method maps directly the optical properties to structures without the requirement of forward simulation and iterative optimization. Here, the given optical properties can work as "prompts" and guide the constructed model to correctly "draw" the required photonic structures. Experiments show that our direct mapping-based inverse design method can generate subwavelength photonic structures at high fidelity while following the given optical properties. This may change the method used for optical design and greatly accelerate the research on new photonic devices.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages attention features extracted from a single reference image to define the intended edits. These features are warped across multiple views by aligning them with scene geometry derived from Gaussian splatting depth estimates. Injecting these warped features into other viewpoints enables coherent propagation of edits, achieving high fidelity and spatial alignment in 3D space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating versatile edits of 3D scenes, significantly advancing the capabilities of scene manipulation compared to the existing methods.

| **[Non-Normal Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07935v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models generate samples by incrementally reversing a process that turns data into noise. We show that when the step size goes to zero, the reversed process is invariant to the distribution of these increments. This reveals a previously unconsidered parameter in the design of diffusion models: the distribution of the diffusion step $\Delta x_k := x_{k} - x_{k + 1}$. This parameter is implicitly set by default to be normally distributed in most diffusion models. By lifting this assumption, we generalize the framework for designing diffusion models and establish an expanded class of diffusion processes with greater flexibility in the choice of loss function used during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on density estimation and generative modeling tasks on standard image datasets, and show that different choices of the distribution of $\Delta x_k$ result in qualitatively different generated samples.</p></details> |  |

However, image generation is time-consuming and memory-intensive. To address this, stable-diffusion.cpp (Sdcpp) emerges as an efficient inference framework to accelerate the diffusion models. Although it is lightweight, the current implementation of ggml_conv_2d operator in Sdcpp is suboptimal, exhibiting both high inference latency and massive memory usage. To address this, in this work, we present an optimized version of Sdcpp leveraging the Winograd algorithm to accelerate 2D convolution operations, which is the primary bottleneck in the pipeline. By analyzing both dependent and independent computation graphs, we exploit the device's locality and parallelism to achieve substantial performance improvements. Our framework delivers correct end-to-end results across various stable diffusion models, including SDv1.4, v1.5, v2.1, SDXL, and SDXL-Turbo. Our evaluation results demonstrate a speedup up to 2.76x for individual convolutional layers and an inference speedup up to 4.79x for the overall image generation process, compared with the original Sdcpp on M1 pro.

| **[Score Change of Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07904v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive a general change of variables formula for score functions, showing that for a smooth, invertible transformation $\mathbf{y} = \phi(\mathbf{x})$, the transformed score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q(\mathbf{y})$ can be expressed directly in terms of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\mathbf{x})$. Using this result, we develop two applications: First, we establish a reverse-time It\^o lemma for score-based diffusion models, allowing the use of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ to reverse an SDE in the transformed space without directly learning $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q_t(\mathbf{y})$. This approach enables training diffusion models in one space but sampling in another, effectively decoupling the forward and reverse processes. Second, we introduce generalized sliced score matching, extending traditional sliced score matching from linear projections to arbitrary smooth transformations. This provides greater flexibility in high-dimensional density estimation. We demonstrate these theoretical advances through applications to diffusion on the probability simplex and empirically compare our generalized score matching approach against traditional sliced score matching methods.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

DDMs generate a path of probability distributions interpolating between a reference Gaussian distribution and a data distribution by incrementally injecting noise into the data. To numerically simulate the sampling process, a discretisation schedule from the reference back towards clean data must be chosen. An appropriate discretisation schedule is crucial to obtain high quality samples. However, beyond hand crafted heuristics, a general method for choosing this schedule remains elusive. This paper presents a novel algorithm for adaptively selecting an optimal discretisation schedule with respect to a cost that we derive. Our cost measures the work done by the simulation procedure to transport samples from one point in the diffusion path to the next. Our method does not require hyperparameter tuning and adapts to the dynamics and geometry of the diffusion path. Our algorithm only involves the evaluation of the estimated Stein score, making it scalable to existing pre-trained models at inference time and online during training. We find that our learned schedule recovers performant schedules previously only discovered through manual search and obtains competitive FID scores on image datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 accepted paper</p></details> |

Existing methods for finetuning diffusion models typically suffer from lack of diversity in generated samples, lack of prior preservation, and/or slow convergence in finetuning. Inspired by recent successes in generative flow networks (GFlowNets), a class of probabilistic models that sample with the unnormalized density of a reward function, we propose a novel GFlowNet method dubbed Nabla-GFlowNet (abbreviated as $\nabla$-GFlowNet), the first GFlowNet method that leverages the rich signal in reward gradients, together with an objective called $\nabla$-DB plus its variant residual $\nabla$-DB designed for prior-preserving diffusion alignment.

The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to a causal transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model supports fast streaming generation of high quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner.

However, without additional guidance, the large motion between frames makes this problem ill-posed. Event-based Video Frame Interpolation (EVFI) addresses this challenge by using sparse, high-temporal-resolution event measurements as motion guidance. This guidance allows EVFI methods to significantly outperform frame-only methods. However, to date, EVFI methods have relied on a limited set of paired event-frame training data, severely limiting their performance and generalization capabilities. In this work, we overcome the limited data challenge by adapting pre-trained video diffusion models trained on internet-scale datasets to EVFI. We experimentally validate our approach on real-world EVFI datasets, including a new one that we introduce.

Yet, a significant challenge remains: generating several video shots of the same characters, preserving their identity without hurting video quality, dynamics, and responsiveness to text prompts. We present Video Storyboarding, a training-free method to enable pretrained text-to-video models to generate multiple shots with consistent characters, by sharing features between them. Our key insight is that self-attention query features (Q) encode both motion and identity. This creates a hard-to-avoid trade-off between preserving character identity and making videos dynamic, when features are shared. To address this issue, we introduce a novel query injection strategy that balances identity preservation and natural motion retention. This approach improves upon naive consistency techniques applied to videos, which often struggle to maintain this delicate equilibrium. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in character consistency across scenes while maintaining high-quality motion and text alignment.

However, accurately describing desired visual attributes can be challenging, especially for non-experts in art and photography. An intuitive solution involves adopting favorable attributes from the source images. Current methods attempt to distill identity and style from source images. However, "style" is a broad concept that includes texture, color, and artistic elements, but does not cover other important attributes such as lighting and dynamics. Additionally, a simplified "style" adaptation prevents combining multiple attributes from different sources into one generated image. In this work, we formulate a more effective approach to decompose the aesthetics of a picture into specific visual attributes, allowing users to apply characteristics such as lighting, texture, and dynamics from different images. To achieve this goal, we constructed the first fine-grained visual attributes dataset (FiVA) to the best of our knowledge. This FiVA dataset features a well-organized taxonomy for visual attributes and includes around 1 M high-quality generated images with visual attribute annotations. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a fine-grained visual attribute adaptation framework (FiVA-Adapter), which decouples and adapts visual attributes from one or more source images into a generated one. This approach enhances user-friendly customization, allowing users to selectively apply desired attributes to create images that meet their unique preferences and specific content requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 (Datasets and Benchmarks Track); Project page: https://fiva-dataset.github.io/</p></details> |

However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, conventional negative prompting is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose a modification of conventional negative prompting. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content including ones proposed by red teams; and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (both image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |

We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based hair transfer framework, named \textit{Stable-Hair}, which robustly transfers a wide range of real-world hairstyles to user-provided faces for virtual hair try-on. To achieve this goal, our Stable-Hair framework is designed as a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we train a Bald Converter alongside stable diffusion to remove hair from the user-provided face images, resulting in bald images. In the second stage, we specifically designed a Hair Extractor and a Latent IdentityNet to transfer the target hairstyle with highly detailed and high-fidelity to the bald image. The Hair Extractor is trained to encode reference images with the desired hairstyles, while the Latent IdentityNet ensures consistency in identity and background. To minimize color deviations between source images and transfer results, we introduce a novel Latent ControlNet architecture, which functions as both the Bald Converter and Latent IdentityNet. After training on our curated triplet dataset, our method accurately transfers highly detailed and high-fidelity hairstyles to the source images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing hair transfer methods.

| **[DeCLIP: Decoding CLIP representations for deepfake localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08849v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models can create entirely new images, but they can also partially modify real images in ways that are undetectable to the human eye. In this paper, we address the challenge of automatically detecting such local manipulations. One of the most pressing problems in deepfake detection remains the ability of models to generalize to different classes of generators. In the case of fully manipulated images, representations extracted from large self-supervised models (such as CLIP) provide a promising direction towards more robust detectors. Here, we introduce DeCLIP, a first attempt to leverage such large pretrained features for detecting local manipulations. We show that, when combined with a reasonably large convolutional decoder, pretrained self-supervised representations are able to perform localization and improve generalization capabilities over existing methods. Unlike previous work, our approach is able to perform localization on the challenging case of latent diffusion models, where the entire image is affected by the fingerprint of the generator. Moreover, we observe that this type of data, which combines local semantic information with a global fingerprint, provides more stable generalization than other categories of generative methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025</p></details> |
| **[DiffSensei: Bridging Multi-Modal LLMs and Diffusion Models for Customized Manga Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07589v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Story visualization, the task of creating visual narratives from textual descriptions, has seen progress with text-to-image generation models. However, these models often lack effective control over character appearances and interactions, particularly in multi-character scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a new task: \textbf{customized manga generation} and introduce \textbf{DiffSensei}, an innovative framework specifically designed for generating manga with dynamic multi-character control. DiffSensei integrates a diffusion-based image generator with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that acts as a text-compatible identity adapter. Our approach employs masked cross-attention to seamlessly incorporate character features, enabling precise layout control without direct pixel transfer. Additionally, the MLLM-based adapter adjusts character features to align with panel-specific text cues, allowing flexible adjustments in character expressions, poses, and actions. We also introduce \textbf{MangaZero}, a large-scale dataset tailored to this task, containing 43,264 manga pages and 427,147 annotated panels, supporting the visualization of varied character interactions and movements across sequential frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSensei outperforms existing models, marking a significant advancement in manga generation by enabling text-adaptable character customization.

| **[Mobile Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07583v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models have achieved impressive realism and controllability but are limited by high computational demands, restricting their use on mobile devices. This paper introduces the first mobile-optimized video diffusion model. Starting from a spatio-temporal UNet from Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), we reduce memory and computational cost by reducing the frame resolution, incorporating multi-scale temporal representations, and introducing two novel pruning schema to reduce the number of channels and temporal blocks. Furthermore, we employ adversarial finetuning to reduce the denoising to a single step. Our model, coined as MobileVD, is 523x more efficient (1817.2 vs. 4.34 TFLOPs) with a slight quality drop (FVD 149 vs. 171), generating latents for a 14x512x256 px clip in 1.7 seconds on a Xiaomi-14 Pro.

While these models are capable of generating high-quality and realistic images, the complexity of sequential denoising has raised societal concerns regarding high computational demands and energy consumption. In response, various efforts have been made to improve inference efficiency. However, most of the existing efforts have taken a fixed approach with neural network simplification or text prompt optimization. Are the quality improvements from all denoising computations equally perceivable to humans? We observed that images from different text prompts may require different computational efforts given the desired content. The observation motivates us to present BudgetFusion, a novel model that suggests the most perceptually efficient number of diffusion steps before a diffusion model starts to generate an image. This is achieved by predicting multi-level perceptual metrics relative to diffusion steps. With the popular Stable Diffusion as an example, we conduct both numerical analyses and user studies. Our experiments show that BudgetFusion saves up to five seconds per prompt without compromising perceptual similarity. We hope this work can initiate efforts toward answering a core question: how much do humans perceptually gain from images created by a generative model, per watt of energy?</p></details> |  |

While improved network architecture and inference algorithms have shown to effectively boost sampling efficiency of diffusion models, the role of model size -- a critical determinant of sampling efficiency -- has not been thoroughly examined. Through empirical analysis of established text-to-image diffusion models, we conduct an in-depth investigation into how model size influences sampling efficiency across varying sampling steps. Our findings unveil a surprising trend: when operating under a given inference budget, smaller models frequently outperform their larger equivalents in generating high-quality results. Moreover, we extend our study to demonstrate the generalizability of the these findings by applying various diffusion samplers, exploring diverse downstream tasks, evaluating post-distilled models, as well as comparing performance relative to training compute. These findings open up new pathways for the development of LDM scaling strategies which can be employed to enhance generative capabilities within limited inference budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR.

Although existing methods ensure reconstruction fidelity through optimization, a drawback of these is the significant amount of time required for optimization. In this paper, we propose negative-prompt inversion, a method capable of achieving equivalent reconstruction solely through forward propagation without optimization, thereby enabling ultrafast editing processes. We experimentally demonstrate that the reconstruction fidelity of our method is comparable to that of existing methods, allowing for inversion at a resolution of 512 pixels and with 50 sampling steps within approximately 5 seconds, which is more than 30 times faster than null-text inversion. Reduction of the computation time by the proposed method further allows us to use a larger number of sampling steps in diffusion models to improve the reconstruction fidelity with a moderate increase in computation time.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

The prevalent approaches typically require training on extensive domain-specific images to achieve identity preservation, which lacks flexibility across different use cases. To address this issue, we exploit classifier guidance, a training-free technique that steers diffusion models using an existing classifier, for personalized image generation. Our study shows that based on a recent rectified flow framework, the major limitation of vanilla classifier guidance in requiring a special classifier can be resolved with a simple fixed-point solution, allowing flexible personalization with off-the-shelf image discriminators. Moreover, its solving procedure proves to be stable when anchored to a reference flow trajectory, with a convergence guarantee. The derived method is implemented on rectified flow with different off-the-shelf image discriminators, delivering advantageous personalization results for human faces, live subjects, and certain objects.

In this work, we propose using discrete-state models to connect them and explore their scalability in the vision domain. First, we conduct a step-by-step analysis in a unified design space across two types of models including timestep-independence, noise schedule, temperature, guidance strength, etc in a scalable manner. Second, we re-cast typical discriminative tasks, e.g., image segmentation, as an unmasking process from [MASK] tokens on a discrete-state model. This enables us to perform various sampling processes, including flexible conditional sampling by only training once to model the joint distribution. All aforementioned explorations lead to our framework named Discrete Interpolants, which enables us to achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to previous discrete-state based methods in various benchmarks, like ImageNet256, MS COCO, and video dataset FaceForensics. In summary, by leveraging [MASK] in discrete-state models, we can bridge Masked Generative and Non-autoregressive Diffusion models, as well as generative and discriminative tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report (WIP), Project Page(code, model, dataset): https://compvis.github.io/mask/</p></details> |

| **[Addressing Attribute Leakages in Diffusion-based Image Editing without Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04715v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become a cornerstone in image editing, offering flexibility with language prompts and source images. However, a key challenge is attribute leakage, where unintended modifications occur in non-target regions or within target regions due to attribute interference. Existing methods often suffer from leakage due to naive text embeddings and inadequate handling of End-of-Sequence (EOS) token embeddings. To address this, we propose ALE-Edit (Attribute-leakage-free editing), a novel framework to minimize attribute leakage with three components: (1) Object-Restricted Embeddings (ORE) to localize object-specific attributes in text embeddings, (2) Region-Guided Blending for Cross-Attention Masking (RGB-CAM) to align attention with target regions, and (3) Background Blending (BB) to preserve non-edited regions. Additionally, we introduce ALE-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating attribute leakage with new metrics for target-external and target-internal leakage. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces attribute leakage while maintaining high editing quality, providing an efficient and tuning-free solution for multi-object image editing.</p></details> |  |

As data size grows, reducing the iteration cost becomes an important goal. Inspired by the great success of the parallel simulation of the initial value problem in scientific computation, we propose parallel Picard methods for sampling tasks. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves better dependence on dimension $d$ than prior works in iteration complexity (i.e., reduced from $\widetilde{O}(\log^2 d)$ to $\widetilde{O}(\log d)$), which is even optimal for sampling under isoperimetry with specific iteration complexity. Our work highlights the potential advantages of simulation methods in scientific computation for dynamics-based sampling and diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.15986 by other authors</p></details> |

By leveraging nonverbal visual communication, through facial expressions, head and body movements, we aim to enhance engagement and capture the user's attention through a novel improvisational element, that goes beyond mirroring gestures. Our goal is to track and analyze facial expressions, and other nonverbal cues in real-time, and use this information to build models that can predict and understand human behavior. Operating in real-time and requiring minimal computational resources, our approach signifies a major leap forward in making AI interactions more natural and accessible. We offer three different complementary approaches, based on retrieval, statistical, and deep learning techniques. A key novelty of our work is the integration of an artistic component atop an efficient human-computer interaction system, using art as a medium to transmit emotions. Our approach is not art-specific and can be adapted to various paintings, animations, and avatars. In our experiments, we compare state-of-the-art diffusion models as mediums for emotion translation in 2D, and our 3D avatar, Maia, that we introduce in this work, with not just facial movements but also body motions for a more natural and engaging experience. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in translating AI-generated emotions into human-relatable expressions, through both human and automatic evaluation procedures, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance the naturalness and engagement of Human-AI interactions across various applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[HiFiVFS: High Fidelity Video Face Swapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18293v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face swapping aims to generate results that combine the identity from the source with attributes from the target. Existing methods primarily focus on image-based face swapping. When processing videos, each frame is handled independently, making it difficult to ensure temporal stability. From a model perspective, face swapping is gradually shifting from generative adversarial networks (GANs) to diffusion models (DMs), as DMs have been shown to possess stronger generative capabilities. Current diffusion-based approaches often employ inpainting techniques, which struggle to preserve fine-grained attributes like lighting and makeup. To address these challenges, we propose a high fidelity video face swapping (HiFiVFS) framework, which leverages the strong generative capability and temporal prior of Stable Video Diffusion (SVD). We build a fine-grained attribute module to extract identity-disentangled and fine-grained attribute features through identity desensitization and adversarial learning. Additionally, We introduce detailed identity injection to further enhance identity similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in video face swapping, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Progressive Influence Maximization in Dynamic Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07402v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence maximization (IM) problem involves identifying a set of key individuals in a social network who can maximize the spread of influence through their network connections. With the advent of geometric deep learning on graphs, great progress has been made towards better solutions for the IM problem. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic non-progressive IM problem, which considers the dynamic nature of real-world social networks and the special case where the influence diffusion is non-progressive, i.e., nodes can be activated multiple times. We first extend an existing diffusion model to capture the non-progressive influence propagation in dynamic social networks. We then propose the method, DNIMRL, which employs deep reinforcement learning and dynamic graph embedding to solve the dynamic non-progressive IM problem. In particular, we propose a novel algorithm that effectively leverages graph embedding to capture the temporal changes of dynamic networks and seamlessly integrates with deep reinforcement learning. The experiments, on different types of real-world social network datasets, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusion Embedding for Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07333v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) aims to synthesize high-quality person images corresponding to target poses while preserving the appearance of the source image. Recently, PGPIS methods that use diffusion models have achieved competitive performance. Most approaches involve extracting representations of the target pose and source image and learning their relationships in the generative model's training process. This approach makes it difficult to learn the semantic relationships between the input and target images and complicates the model structure needed to enhance generation results. To address these issues, we propose Fusion embedding for PGPIS using a Diffusion Model (FPDM). Inspired by the successful application of pre-trained CLIP models in text-to-image diffusion models, our method consists of two stages. The first stage involves training the fusion embedding of the source image and target pose to align with the target image's embedding. In the second stage, the generative model uses this fusion embedding as a condition to generate the target image. We applied the proposed method to the benchmark datasets DeepFashion and RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T, and conducted both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. An ablation study of the model structure showed that even a model using only the second stage achieved performance close to the other PGPIS SOTA models.

Data synthesis can address this by generating artificial datasets that mirror real-world data. In this paper, we propose AppGen, an autoregressive generative model designed to generate app usage behavior based on users' mobility trajectories, improving dataset accessibility and quality. Specifically, AppGen employs a probabilistic diffusion model to simulate the stochastic nature of app usage behavior. By utilizing an autoregressive structure, AppGen effectively captures the intricate sequential relationships between different app usage events. Additionally, AppGen leverages latent encoding to extract semantic features from spatio-temporal points, guiding behavior generation. These key designs ensure the generated behaviors are contextually relevant and faithfully represent users' environments and past interactions. Experiments with two real-world datasets show that AppGen outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 12% in critical metrics and accurately reflects real-world spatio-temporal patterns. We also test the generated datasets in applications, demonstrating their suitability for downstream tasks by maintaining algorithm accuracy and order.</p></details> |  |
| **[IF-MDM: Implicit Face Motion Diffusion Model for High-Fidelity Realtime Talking Head Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04000v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel approach for high-resolution talking head generation from a single image and audio input. Prior methods using explicit face models, like 3D morphable models (3DMM) and facial landmarks, often fall short in generating high-fidelity videos due to their lack of appearance-aware motion representation. While generative approaches such as video diffusion models achieve high video quality, their slow processing speeds limit practical application. Our proposed model, Implicit Face Motion Diffusion Model (IF-MDM), employs implicit motion to encode human faces into appearance-aware compressed facial latents, enhancing video generation. Although implicit motion lacks the spatial disentanglement of explicit models, which complicates alignment with subtle lip movements, we introduce motion statistics to help capture fine-grained motion information. Additionally, our model provides motion controllability to optimize the trade-off between motion intensity and visual quality during inference. IF-MDM supports real-time generation of 512x512 resolution videos at up to 45 frames per second (fps). Extensive evaluations demonstrate its superior performance over existing diffusion and explicit face models. The code will be released publicly, available alongside supplementary materials. The video results can be found on https://bit.ly/ifmdm_supplementary.</p></details> | Underreview |

We hypothesize that this is because there is no explicit supervision in terms of spatial tracking at the feature level. We propose Track4Gen, a spatially aware video generator that combines video diffusion loss with point tracking across frames, providing enhanced spatial supervision on the diffusion features. Track4Gen merges the video generation and point tracking tasks into a single network by making minimal changes to existing video generation architectures. Using Stable Video Diffusion as a backbone, Track4Gen demonstrates that it is possible to unify video generation and point tracking, which are typically handled as separate tasks. Our extensive evaluations show that Track4Gen effectively reduces appearance drift, resulting in temporally stable and visually coherent video generation.

Randomized methods like Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) provide state-of-the-art and essentially unimprovable theoretical guarantees for achieving such representations. These guarantees are worst-case and in particular, neither the analysis, nor the algorithm, takes into account any potential structural information of the data. The natural question is: must we randomize? Could we instead use an optimization-based approach, working directly with the data? A first answer is no: as we show, the distance-preserving objective of JL has a non-convex landscape over the space of projection matrices, with many bad stationary points. But this is not the final answer. We present a novel method motivated by diffusion models, that circumvents this fundamental challenge: rather than performing optimization directly over the space of projection matrices, we use optimization over the larger space of random solution samplers, gradually reducing the variance of the sampler. We show that by moving through this larger space, our objective converges to a deterministic (zero variance) solution, avoiding bad stationary points. This method can also be seen as an optimization-based derandomization approach and is an idea and method that we believe can be applied to many other problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mathematical analysis of singularities in the diffusion model under the submanifold assumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07882v4)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper concerns the mathematical analyses of the diffusion model in machine learning. The drift term of the backward sampling process is represented as a conditional expectation involving the data distribution and the forward diffusion. The training process aims to find such a drift function by minimizing the mean-squared residue related to the conditional expectation. Using small-time approximations of the Green's function of the forward diffusion, we show that the analytical mean drift function in DDPM and the score function in SGM asymptotically blow up in the final stages of the sampling process for singular data distributions such as those concentrated on lower-dimensional manifolds, and are therefore difficult to approximate by a network. To overcome this difficulty, we derive a new target function and associated loss, which remains bounded even for singular data distributions. We validate the theoretical findings with several numerical examples.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving semantic consistency and perceptual naturalness to meet human perception demands remains difficult, especially under conditions of heavy degradation and varied input complexities. To tackle this, we propose Hero-SR, a one-step diffusion-based SR framework explicitly designed with human perception priors. Hero-SR consists of two novel modules: the Dynamic Time-Step Module (DTSM), which adaptively selects optimal diffusion steps for flexibly meeting human perceptual standards, and the Open-World Multi-modality Supervision (OWMS), which integrates guidance from both image and text domains through CLIP to improve semantic consistency and perceptual naturalness. Through these modules, Hero-SR generates high-resolution images that not only preserve intricate details but also reflect human perceptual preferences. Extensive experiments validate that Hero-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance in Real-SR. The code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

They have demonstrated promising results on both density estimation and generative modeling tasks, but have received relatively little attention in recent years. In this work, we demonstrate that NFs are more powerful than previously believed. We present TarFlow: a simple and scalable architecture that enables highly performant NF models. TarFlow can be thought of as a Transformer-based variant of Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAFs): it consists of a stack of autoregressive Transformer blocks on image patches, alternating the autoregression direction between layers. TarFlow is straightforward to train end-to-end, and capable of directly modeling and generating pixels. We also propose three key techniques to improve sample quality: Gaussian noise augmentation during training, a post training denoising procedure, and an effective guidance method for both class-conditional and unconditional settings. Putting these together, TarFlow sets new state-of-the-art results on likelihood estimation for images, beating the previous best methods by a large margin, and generates samples with quality and diversity comparable to diffusion models, for the first time with a stand-alone NF model. We make our code available at https://github.com/apple/ml-tarflow.</p></details> |  |

Existing diffusion-based SR approaches typically utilize semantic information from degraded images and restoration prompts to activate prior for producing realistic high-resolution images. However, general-purpose pretrained diffusion models, not designed for restoration tasks, often have suboptimal prior, and manually defined prompts may fail to fully exploit the generated potential. To address these limitations, we introduce RAP-SR, a novel restoration prior enhancement approach in pretrained diffusion models for Real-SR. First, we develop the High-Fidelity Aesthetic Image Dataset (HFAID), curated through a Quality-Driven Aesthetic Image Selection Pipeline (QDAISP). Our dataset not only surpasses existing ones in fidelity but also excels in aesthetic quality. Second, we propose the Restoration Priors Enhancement Framework, which includes Restoration Priors Refinement (RPR) and Restoration-Oriented Prompt Optimization (ROPO) modules. RPR refines the restoration prior using the HFAID, while ROPO optimizes the unique restoration identifier, improving the quality of the resulting images. RAP-SR effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose models and the demands of Real-SR by enhancing restoration prior.

| **[FIRE: Robust Detection of Diffusion-Generated Images via Frequency-Guided Reconstruction Error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07140v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion models has significantly improved high-quality image generation, making generated content increasingly challenging to distinguish from real images and raising concerns about potential misuse. In this paper, we observe that diffusion models struggle to accurately reconstruct mid-band frequency information in real images, suggesting the limitation could serve as a cue for detecting diffusion model generated images. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel method called Frequency-guided Reconstruction Error (FIRE), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to investigate the influence of frequency decomposition on reconstruction error. FIRE assesses the variation in reconstruction error before and after the frequency decomposition, offering a robust method for identifying diffusion model generated images. Extensive experiments show that FIRE generalizes effectively to unseen diffusion models and maintains robustness against diverse perturbations.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

It involves using computational methods to mimic and convey human emotions through various modalities, with the goal of enabling more natural and effective human-computer interactions. Recent advancements in generative models, such as Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, Diffusion Models, Large Language Models, and Sequence-to-Sequence Models, have significantly contributed to the development of this field. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive reviews in this field. To address this problem, this paper aims to address this gap by providing a thorough and systematic overview of recent advancements in human emotion synthesis based on generative models. Specifically, this review will first present the review methodology, the emotion models involved, the mathematical principles of generative models, and the datasets used. Then, the review covers the application of different generative models to emotion synthesis based on a variety of modalities, including facial images, speech, and text. It also examines mainstream evaluation metrics. Additionally, the review presents some major findings and suggests future research directions, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of generative technology in the nuanced domain of emotion synthesis.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures |

We apply Diffusion Forcing to sequence generative modeling by training a causal next-token prediction model to generate one or several future tokens without fully diffusing past ones. Our approach is shown to combine the strengths of next-token prediction models, such as variable-length generation, with the strengths of full-sequence diffusion models, such as the ability to guide sampling to desirable trajectories. Our method offers a range of additional capabilities, such as (1) rolling-out sequences of continuous tokens, such as video, with lengths past the training horizon, where baselines diverge and (2) new sampling and guiding schemes that uniquely profit from Diffusion Forcing's variable-horizon and causal architecture, and which lead to marked performance gains in decision-making and planning tasks. In addition to its empirical success, our method is proven to optimize a variational lower bound on the likelihoods of all subsequences of tokens drawn from the true joint distribution.

However, creating high-quality, diverse synthetic 3D content often requires expert intervention, making it costly and complex. Recently, efforts to automate this process with learning techniques, particularly diffusion models, have shown significant improvements in tasks like furniture rearrangement. However, applying diffusion models to floor-conditioned indoor scene synthesis remains under-explored. This task is especially challenging as it requires arranging objects in continuous space while selecting from discrete object categories, posing unique difficulties for conventional diffusion methods. To bridge this gap, we present MiDiffusion, a novel mixed discrete-continuous diffusion model designed to synthesize plausible 3D indoor scenes given a floor plan and pre-arranged objects. We represent a scene layout by a 2D floor plan and a set of objects, each defined by category, location, size, and orientation. Our approach uniquely applies structured corruption across mixed discrete semantic and continuous geometric domains, resulting in a better-conditioned problem for denoising. Evaluated on the 3D-FRONT dataset, MiDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion models in floor-conditioned 3D scene synthesis. Additionally, it effectively handles partial object constraints via a corruption-and-masking strategy without task-specific training, demonstrating advantages in scene completion and furniture arrangement tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures.

However, this often inadvertently leads to the generation of harmful or inappropriate content and raises copyright concerns. Driven by these concerns, machine unlearning has become crucial to effectively purge undesirable knowledge from models. While existing literature has studied various unlearning techniques, these often suffer from either poor unlearning quality or degradation in text-image alignment after unlearning, due to the competitive nature of these objectives. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that seeks an optimal model update at each unlearning iteration, ensuring monotonic improvement on both objectives. We further derive the characterization of such an update. In addition, we design procedures to strategically diversify the unlearning and remaining datasets to boost performance improvement. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively removes target classes from recent diffusion-based generative models and concepts from stable diffusion models while maintaining close alignment with the models' original trained states, thus outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Rather than merely mode-seeking, our method achieves sampling by "pulling back" the dynamics of the reverse-time process--from the image space to the diffrep parameter space--and updating the parameters according to this pulled-back process. We identify an implicit constraint on the samples induced by the diffrep and demonstrate that addressing this constraint significantly improves the consistency and detail of the generated objects. Our method yields diffreps with substantially improved quality and diversity for images, panoramas, and 3D NeRFs compared to existing techniques. Our approach is a general-purpose method for sampling diffreps, expanding the scope of problems that diffusion models can tackle.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Edge-SD-SR: Low Latency and Parameter Efficient On-device Super-Resolution with Stable Diffusion via Bidirectional Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06978v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been immense progress recently in the visual quality of Stable Diffusion-based Super Resolution (SD-SR). However, deploying large diffusion models on computationally restricted devices such as mobile phones remains impractical due to the large model size and high latency. This is compounded for SR as it often operates at high res (e.g. 4Kx3K). In this work, we introduce Edge-SD-SR, the first parameter efficient and low latency diffusion model for image super-resolution. Edge-SD-SR consists of ~169M parameters, including UNet, encoder and decoder, and has a complexity of only ~142 GFLOPs. To maintain a high visual quality on such low compute budget, we introduce a number of training strategies: (i) A novel conditioning mechanism on the low resolution input, coined bidirectional conditioning, which tailors the SD model for the SR task. (ii) Joint training of the UNet and encoder, while decoupling the encodings of the HR and LR images and using a dedicated schedule. (iii) Finetuning the decoder using the UNet's output to directly tailor the decoder to the latents obtained at inference time. Edge-SD-SR runs efficiently on device, e.g. it can upscale a 128x128 patch to 512x512 in 38 msec while running on a Samsung S24 DSP, and of a 512x512 to 2048x2048 (requiring 25 model evaluations) in just ~1.1 sec. Furthermore, we show that Edge-SD-SR matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art SR approaches on the most established SR benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To address the typically slow iterative sampling process of diffusion models, we apply consistency distillation and reduce the sampling process to a single step, achieving performance comparable to that of diffusion models, and with two or more steps, even surpassing them. Trained on the Slakh2100 dataset for four instruments (bass, drums, guitar, and piano), our model shows significant improvements across objective metrics compared to baseline methods.

Incorporating prior information from potential velocity distributions, well-log information, and our geological knowledge and expectations can significantly improve FWI convergence to a realistic model. While diffusion-regularized FWI has shown improved performance compared to conventional FWI by incorporating the velocity distribution prior, it can benefit even more by incorporating well-log information and other geological knowledge priors. To leverage this fact, we propose a geological class and well-information prior-assisted FWI using conditional diffusion models. This method seamlessly integrates multi-modal information into FWI, simultaneously achieving data fitting and universal geologic and geophysics prior matching, which is often not achieved with traditional regularization methods. Specifically, we propose to combine conditional diffusion models with FWI, where we integrate well-log data and geological class conditions into these conditional diffusion models using classifier-free guidance for multi-modal prior matching beyond the original velocity distribution prior. Numerical experiments on the OpenFWI datasets and field marine data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional FWI and the unconditional diffusion-regularized FWI.</p></details> |  |

Previous work demonstrates that INRs improve rapid MRI through inherent regularization imposed by neural network architectures. Typically parameterized by fully-connected neural networks, INRs support continuous image representations by taking a physical coordinate location as input and outputting the intensity at that coordinate. Previous work has applied unlearned regularization priors during INR training and have been limited to 2D or low-resolution 3D acquisitions. Meanwhile, diffusion based generative models have received recent attention as they learn powerful image priors decoupled from the measurement model. This work proposes INFusion, a technique that regularizes the optimization of INRs from under-sampled MR measurements with pre-trained diffusion models for improved image reconstruction. In addition, we propose a hybrid 3D approach with our diffusion regularization that enables INR application on large-scale 3D MR datasets. 2D experiments demonstrate improved INR training with our proposed diffusion regularization, and 3D experiments demonstrate feasibility of INR training with diffusion regularization on 3D matrix sizes of 256 by 256 by 80.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, asilomar 2024 submission</p></details> |

However, they often fail to produce realistic geometric details, resulting in overly smooth surfaces or geometric details inaccurately baked in albedo maps. To address this, we introduce a new method that incorporates touch as an additional modality to improve the geometric details of generated 3D assets. We design a lightweight 3D texture field to synthesize visual and tactile textures, guided by 2D diffusion model priors on both visual and tactile domains. We condition the visual texture generation on high-resolution tactile normals and guide the patch-based tactile texture refinement with a customized TextureDreambooth. We further present a multi-part generation pipeline that enables us to synthesize different textures across various regions. To our knowledge, we are the first to leverage high-resolution tactile sensing to enhance geometric details for 3D generation tasks. We evaluate our method in both text-to-3D and image-to-3D settings. Our experiments demonstrate that our method provides customized and realistic fine geometric textures while maintaining accurate alignment between two modalities of vision and touch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Diverse Score Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06780v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score distillation of 2D diffusion models has proven to be a powerful mechanism to guide 3D optimization, for example enabling text-based 3D generation or single-view reconstruction. A common limitation of existing score distillation formulations, however, is that the outputs of the (mode-seeking) optimization are limited in diversity despite the underlying diffusion model being capable of generating diverse samples. In this work, inspired by the sampling process in denoising diffusion, we propose a score formulation that guides the optimization to follow generation paths defined by random initial seeds, thus ensuring diversity. We then present an approximation to adopt this formulation for scenarios where the optimization may not precisely follow the generation paths (e.g. a 3D representation whose renderings evolve in a co-dependent manner). We showcase the applications of our `Diverse Score Distillation' (DSD) formulation across tasks such as 2D optimization, text-based 3D inference, and single-view reconstruction. We also empirically validate DSD against prior score distillation formulations and show that it significantly improves sample diversity while preserving fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://billyxyb.github.io/Diverse-Score-Distillation/</p></details> |
| **[Visual Lexicon: Rich Image Features in Language Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06774v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Visual Lexicon, a novel visual language that encodes rich image information into the text space of vocabulary tokens while retaining intricate visual details that are often challenging to convey in natural language. Unlike traditional methods that prioritize either high-level semantics (e.g., CLIP) or pixel-level reconstruction (e.g., VAE), ViLex simultaneously captures rich semantic content and fine visual details, enabling high-quality image generation and comprehensive visual scene understanding. Through a self-supervised learning pipeline, ViLex generates tokens optimized for reconstructing input images using a frozen text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, preserving the detailed information necessary for high-fidelity semantic-level reconstruction. As an image embedding in the language space, ViLex tokens leverage the compositionality of natural languages, allowing them to be used independently as "text tokens" or combined with natural language tokens to prompt pretrained T2I models with both visual and textual inputs, mirroring how we interact with vision-language models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that ViLex achieves higher fidelity in image reconstruction compared to text embeddings--even with a single ViLex token. Moreover, ViLex successfully performs various DreamBooth tasks in a zero-shot, unsupervised manner without fine-tuning T2I models. Additionally, ViLex serves as a powerful vision encoder, consistently improving vision-language model performance across 15 benchmarks relative to a strong SigLIP baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report. 16 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Existing methods often struggle with slow processing times and suboptimal restoration, especially under severe degradation, failing to accurately reconstruct finer-level identity details. To address these issues, we introduce InstantRestore, a novel framework that leverages a single-step image diffusion model and an attention-sharing mechanism for fast and personalized face restoration. Additionally, InstantRestore incorporates a novel landmark attention loss, aligning key facial landmarks to refine the attention maps, enhancing identity preservation. At inference time, given a degraded input and a small (~4) set of reference images, InstantRestore performs a single forward pass through the network to achieve near real-time performance. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full diffusion processes or per-identity model tuning, InstantRestore offers a scalable solution suitable for large-scale applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstantRestore outperforms existing methods in quality and speed, making it an appealing choice for identity-preserving face restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/InstantRestore/</p></details> |

Malicious adversarial attacks can evade these developing AIGC detection. However, most existing adversarial attacks focus only on GAN-generated facial images detection, struggle to be effective on multi-class natural images and diffusion-based detectors, and exhibit poor invisibility. To fill this gap, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the vulnerability of AIGC detectors and discover the feature that detectors vary in vulnerability to different post-processing. Then, considering the uncertainty of detectors in real-world scenarios, and based on the discovery, we propose a Realistic-like Robust Black-box Adversarial attack (R$^2$BA) with post-processing fusion optimization. Unlike typical perturbations, R$^2$BA uses real-world post-processing, i.e., Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, Gaussian noise and light spot to generate adversarial examples. Specifically, we use a stochastic particle swarm algorithm with inertia decay to optimize post-processing fusion intensity and explore the detector's decision boundary. Guided by the detector's fake probability, R$^2$BA enhances/weakens the detector-vulnerable/detector-robust post-processing intensity to strike a balance between adversariality and invisibility. Extensive experiments on popular/commercial AIGC detectors and datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BA exhibits impressive anti-detection performance, excellent invisibility, and strong robustness in GAN-based and diffusion-based cases. Compared to state-of-the-art white-box and black-box attacks, R$^2$BA shows significant improvements of 15% and 21% in anti-detection performance under the original and robust scenario respectively, offering valuable insights for the security of AIGC detection in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance is upper-bounded by constrained 3D priors due to the lack of scalable learning paradigms. In this work, we present See3D, a visual-conditional multi-view diffusion model trained on large-scale Internet videos for open-world 3D creation. The model aims to Get 3D knowledge by solely Seeing the visual contents from the vast and rapidly growing video data -- You See it, You Got it. To achieve this, we first scale up the training data using a proposed data curation pipeline that automatically filters out multi-view inconsistencies and insufficient observations from source videos. This results in a high-quality, richly diverse, large-scale dataset of multi-view images, termed WebVi3D, containing 320M frames from 16M video clips. Nevertheless, learning generic 3D priors from videos without explicit 3D geometry or camera pose annotations is nontrivial, and annotating poses for web-scale videos is prohibitively expensive. To eliminate the need for pose conditions, we introduce an innovative visual-condition - a purely 2D-inductive visual signal generated by adding time-dependent noise to the masked video data. Finally, we introduce a novel visual-conditional 3D generation framework by integrating See3D into a warping-based pipeline for high-fidelity 3D generation. Our numerical and visual comparisons on single and sparse reconstruction benchmarks show that See3D, trained on cost-effective and scalable video data, achieves notable zero-shot and open-world generation capabilities, markedly outperforming models trained on costly and constrained 3D datasets.

Due to its ill-posed nature, recent works leverage powerful prior from 2D diffusion models pretrained on large datasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalization capability, they cannot guarantee the generated multi-view images are 3D consistent. In this paper, we propose Gen-3Diffusion: Realistic Image-to-3D Generation via 2D & 3D Diffusion Synergy. We leverage a pre-trained 2D diffusion model and a 3D diffusion model via our elegantly designed process that synchronizes two diffusion models at both training and sampling time. The synergy between the 2D and 3D diffusion models brings two major advantages: 1) 2D helps 3D in generalization: the pretrained 2D model has strong generalization ability to unseen images, providing strong shape priors for the 3D diffusion model; 2) 3D helps 2D in multi-view consistency: the 3D diffusion model enhances the 3D consistency of 2D multi-view sampling process, resulting in more accurate multi-view generation. We validate our idea through extensive experiments in image-based objects and clothed avatar generation tasks. Results show that our method generates realistic 3D objects and avatars with high-fidelity geometry and texture. Extensive ablations also validate our design choices and demonstrate the strong generalization ability to diverse clothing and compositional shapes.

| **[Efficiency Meets Fidelity: A Novel Quantization Framework for Stable Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06661v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation of Stable Diffusion models has achieved notable success due to its remarkable generation ability. However, the repetitive denoising process is computationally intensive during inference, which renders Diffusion models less suitable for real-world applications that require low latency and scalability. Recent studies have employed post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods to compress Diffusion models. Nevertheless, prior research has often neglected to examine the consistency between results generated by quantized models and those from floating-point models. This consistency is crucial in fields such as content creation, design, and edge deployment, as it can significantly enhance both efficiency and system stability for practitioners. To ensure that quantized models generate high-quality and consistent images, we propose an efficient quantization framework for Stable Diffusion models. Our approach features a Serial-to-Parallel calibration pipeline that addresses the consistency of both the calibration and inference processes, as well as ensuring training stability. Based on this pipeline, we further introduce a mix-precision quantization strategy, multi-timestep activation quantization, and time information precalculation techniques to ensure high-fidelity generation in comparison to floating-point models. Through extensive experiments with Stable Diffusion v1-4, v2-1, and XL 1.0, we have demonstrated that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art techniques when tested on prompts from the COCO validation dataset and the Stable-Diffusion-Prompts dataset. Under W4A8 quantization settings, our approach enhances both distribution similarity and visual similarity by 45%-60%.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce a new method for instructional video generation. Our diffusion-based method incorporates two distinct innovations. First, we propose an automatic method to generate the expected region of motion, guided by both the visual context and the action text.

However, corresponding evaluation methods struggle to keep pace. Automatic approaches have proven challenging to align with human preferences, and the mixed comparison of text- and image-driven methods often leads to unfair evaluations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework to better align and evaluate multi-view diffusion models with human preferences. To begin with, we first collect and filter a standardized image prompt set from DALL$\cdot$E and Objaverse, which we then use to generate multi-view assets with several multi-view diffusion models. Through a systematic ranking pipeline on these assets, we obtain a human annotation dataset with 16k expert pairwise comparisons and train a reward model, coined MVReward, to effectively encode human preferences. With MVReward, image-driven 3D methods can be evaluated against each other in a more fair and transparent manner. Building on this, we further propose Multi-View Preference Learning (MVP), a plug-and-play multi-view diffusion tuning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVReward can serve as a reliable metric and MVP consistently enhances the alignment of multi-view diffusion models with human preferences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Augmentation for Seizure Prediction with Generative Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08256v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation (DA) can significantly strengthen the electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure prediction methods. However, existing DA approaches are just the linear transformations of original data and cannot explore the feature space to increase diversity effectively. Therefore, we propose a novel diffusion-based DA method called DiffEEG. DiffEEG can fully explore data distribution and generate samples with high diversity, offering extra information to classifiers. It involves two processes: the diffusion process and the denoised process. In the diffusion process, the model incrementally adds noise with different scales to EEG input and converts it into random noise. In this way, the representation of data can be learned. In the denoised process, the model utilizes learned knowledge to sample synthetic data from random noise input by gradually removing noise. The randomness of input noise and the precise representation enable the synthetic samples to possess diversity while ensuring the consistency of feature space. We compared DiffEEG with original, down-sampling, sliding windows and recombination methods, and integrated them into five representative classifiers. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. With the contribution of DiffEEG, the Multi-scale CNN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average sensitivity, FPR, AUC of 95.4%, 0.051/h, 0.932 on the CHB-MIT database and 93.6%, 0.121/h, 0.822 on the Kaggle database.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

For this reason, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation into network architectures, training strategies, and inference processs. Based on the profound analysis, we tailor each component for efficient high-quality human motion generation. Despite the promising performance, the tailored model still suffers from foot skating which is an ubiquitous issue in diffusion-based solutions. To eliminate footskate, we identify foot-ground contact and correct foot motions along the denoising process. By organically combining these well-designed components together, we present StableMoFusion, a robust and efficient framework for human motion generation. Extensive experimental results show that our StableMoFusion performs favorably against current state-of-the-art methods.

The unique capabilities of UAVs give rise to increasingly critical and complex tasks in uncertain and potentially harsh environments. The substantial amount of data generated from these applications necessitates processing and analysis through deep neural networks (DNNs). However, UAVs encounter challenges due to their limited computing resources when managing DNN models. This paper presents a joint approach that combines multiple-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and generative diffusion models (GDM) for assigning DNN tasks to a UAV swarm, aimed at reducing latency from task capture to result output. To address these challenges, we first consider the task size of the target area to be inspected and the shortest flying path as optimization constraints, employing a greedy algorithm to resolve the subproblem with a focus on minimizing the UAV's flying path and the overall system cost. In the second stage, we introduce a novel DNN task assignment algorithm, termed GDM-MADDPG, which utilizes the reverse denoising process of GDM to replace the actor network in multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). This approach generates specific DNN task assignment actions based on agents' observations in a dynamic environment. Simulation results indicate that our algorithm performs favorably compared to benchmarks in terms of path planning, Age of Information (AoI), energy consumption, and task load balancing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Sample Complexity Bounds for Diffusion Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13745v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become the most popular approach to deep generative modeling of images, largely due to their empirical performance and reliability. From a theoretical standpoint, a number of recent works~\cite{chen2022,chen2022improved,benton2023linear} have studied the iteration complexity of sampling, assuming access to an accurate diffusion model. In this work, we focus on understanding the \emph{sample complexity} of training such a model; how many samples are needed to learn an accurate diffusion model using a sufficiently expressive neural network? Prior work~\cite{BMR20} showed bounds polynomial in the dimension, desired Total Variation error, and Wasserstein error. We show an \emph{exponential improvement} in the dependence on Wasserstein error and depth, along with improved dependencies on other relevant parameters.</p></details> | Bugfix |
| **[Guiding a Diffusion Model with a Bad Version of Itself](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02507v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Generators characterize the infinitesimal evolution of a Markov process, which we leverage for generative modeling in a similar vein to flow matching: we construct conditional generators which generate single data points, then learn to approximate the marginal generator which generates the full data distribution. We show that generator matching unifies various generative modeling methods, including diffusion models, flow matching and discrete diffusion models. Furthermore, it provides the foundation to expand the design space to new and unexplored Markov processes such as jump processes. Finally, generator matching enables the construction of superpositions of Markov generative processes and enables the construction of multimodal models in a rigorous manner. We empirically validate our method on protein and image structure generation, showing that superposition with a jump process improves image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[See Further When Clear: Curriculum Consistency Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06295v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant advances have been made in the sampling efficiency of diffusion models and flow matching models, driven by Consistency Distillation (CD), which trains a student model to mimic the output of a teacher model at a later timestep. However, we found that the learning complexity of the student model varies significantly across different timesteps, leading to suboptimal performance in CD.To address this issue, we propose the Curriculum Consistency Model (CCM), which stabilizes and balances the learning complexity across timesteps. Specifically, we regard the distillation process at each timestep as a curriculum and introduce a metric based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) to quantify the learning complexity of this curriculum, then ensure that the curriculum maintains consistent learning complexity across different timesteps by having the teacher model iterate more steps when the noise intensity is low. Our method achieves competitive single-step sampling Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores of 1.64 on CIFAR-10 and 2.18 on ImageNet 64x64.Moreover, we have extended our method to large-scale text-to-image models and confirmed that it generalizes well to both diffusion models (Stable Diffusion XL) and flow matching models (Stable Diffusion 3). The generated samples demonstrate improved image-text alignment and semantic structure, since CCM enlarges the distillation step at large timesteps and reduces the accumulated error.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose two methods to enhance VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities using simulated data. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained VLM using question-answer (QA) pairs generated from simulations relevant to physical reasoning tasks. Second, we introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), specialized VLMs fine-tuned to create scene descriptions enriched with physical properties and processes. During physical reasoning tasks, these PCBs can be leveraged as context to assist a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve its performance. We evaluate both of our approaches using multiple benchmarks, including a new stability detection QA dataset called Falling Tower, which includes both simulated and real-world scenes, and CLEVRER. We demonstrate that a small QA fine-tuned VLM can significantly outperform larger state-of-the-art foundational models. We also show that integrating PCBs boosts the performance of foundational LLMs on physical reasoning tasks. Using the real-world scenes from the Falling Tower dataset, we also validate the robustness of both approaches in Sim2Real transfer. Our results highlight the utility that simulated data can have in the creation of learning systems capable of advanced physical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, few studies have developed benchmarks specifically tailored for detailed captions to measure their accuracy and comprehensiveness. In this paper, we introduce a detailed caption benchmark, termed as CompreCap, to evaluate the visual context from a directed scene graph view. Concretely, we first manually segment the image into semantically meaningful regions (i.e., semantic segmentation mask) according to common-object vocabulary, while also distinguishing attributes of objects within all those regions. Then directional relation labels of these objects are annotated to compose a directed scene graph that can well encode rich compositional information of the image. Based on our directed scene graph, we develop a pipeline to assess the generated detailed captions from LVLMs on multiple levels, including the object-level coverage, the accuracy of attribute descriptions, the score of key relationships, etc. Experimental results on the CompreCap dataset confirm that our evaluation method aligns closely with human evaluation scores across LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures.

However, their performance on satellite imagery is limited due to the underrepresentation of such data in their training sets, which predominantly consist of ground-level images. Existing prompting techniques for satellite imagery are often restricted to generic phrases like a satellite image of ..., limiting their effectiveness for zero-shot land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping. To address these challenges, we introduce SenCLIP, which transfers CLIPs representation to Sentinel-2 imagery by leveraging a large dataset of Sentinel-2 images paired with geotagged ground-level photos from across Europe. We evaluate SenCLIP alongside other SOTA remote sensing VLMs on zero-shot LULC mapping tasks using the EuroSAT and BigEarthNet datasets with both aerial and ground-level prompting styles. Our approach, which aligns ground-level representations with satellite imagery, demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy across both prompt styles, opening new possibilities for applying free-form textual descriptions in zero-shot LULC mapping.</p></details> | Accepted at WACV'25 |
| **[Lan-grasp: Using Large Language Models for Semantic Object Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05239v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Lan-grasp, a novel approach towards more appropriate semantic grasping. We use foundation models to provide the robot with a deeper understanding of the objects, the right place to grasp an object, or even the parts to avoid. This allows our robot to grasp and utilize objects in a more meaningful and safe manner. We leverage the combination of a Large Language Model, a Vision Language Model, and a traditional grasp planner to generate grasps demonstrating a deeper semantic understanding of the objects. We first prompt the Large Language Model about which object part is appropriate for grasping. Next, the Vision Language Model identifies the corresponding part in the object image. Finally, we generate grasp proposals in the region proposed by the Vision Language Model. Building on foundation models provides us with a zero-shot grasp method that can handle a wide range of objects without the need for further training or fine-tuning. We evaluated our method in real-world experiments on a custom object data set. We present the results of a survey that asks the participants to choose an object part appropriate for grasping. The results show that the grasps generated by our method are consistently ranked higher by the participants than those generated by a conventional grasping planner and a recent semantic grasping approach. In addition, we propose a Visual Chain-of-Thought feedback loop to assess grasp feasibility in complex scenarios. This mechanism enables dynamic reasoning and generates alternative grasp strategies when needed, ensuring safer and more effective grasping outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Building on this trend, we introduce a new vision-language model, POINTS1.5, designed to excel in various real-world applications. POINTS1.5 is an enhancement of POINTS1.0 and incorporates several key innovations: i) We replace the original CLIP vision encoder, which had a fixed image resolution, with a NaViT-style vision encoder that supports native dynamic high resolution. This allows POINTS1.5 to process images of any resolution without needing to split them into tiles. ii) We add bilingual support to POINTS1.5, significantly enhancing its capability in Chinese. Due to the scarcity of open-source Chinese datasets for vision-language models, we collect numerous images from the Internet and annotate them using a combination of manual and automatic methods. iii) We propose a set of rigorous filtering methods for visual instruction tuning datasets. We comprehensively evaluate all these filtering methods, and choose the most effective ones to obtain the final visual instruction tuning set. Thanks to these innovations, POINTS1.5 significantly outperforms POINTS1.0 and demonstrates strong performance across a range of real-world applications. Notably, POINTS1.5-7B is trained on fewer than 4 billion tokens and ranks first on the OpenCompass leaderboard among models with fewer than 10 billion parameters</p></details> |  |
| **[LOMA: Language-assisted Semantic Occupancy Network via Triplane Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08388v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction has become a popular research task due to its versatility and affordability. Nowadays, conventional methods usually project the image-based vision features to 3D space and learn the geometric information through the attention mechanism, enabling the 3D semantic occupancy prediction. However, these works usually face two main challenges: 1) Limited geometric information. Due to the lack of geometric information in the image itself, it is challenging to directly predict 3D space information, especially in large-scale outdoor scenes. 2) Local restricted interaction. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, they often use modified local attention to fuse features, resulting in a restricted fusion. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a language-assisted 3D semantic occupancy prediction network, named LOMA. In the proposed vision-language framework, we first introduce a VL-aware Scene Generator (VSG) module to generate the 3D language feature of the scene. By leveraging the vision-language model, this module provides implicit geometric knowledge and explicit semantic information from the language. Furthermore, we present a Tri-plane Fusion Mamba (TFM) block to efficiently fuse the 3D language feature and 3D vision feature. The proposed module not only fuses the two features with global modeling but also avoids too much computation costs. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 datasets show that our algorithm achieves new state-of-the-art performances in both geometric and semantic completion tasks. Our code will be open soon.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[HyViLM: Enhancing Fine-Grained Recognition with a Hybrid Encoder for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08378v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been growing interest in the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to process high-resolution images. A common approach currently involves dynamically cropping the original high-resolution image into smaller sub-images, which are then fed into a vision encoder that was pre-trained on lower-resolution images. However, this cropping approach often truncates objects and connected areas in the original image, causing semantic breaks. To address this limitation, we introduce HyViLM, designed to process images of any resolution while retaining the overall context during encoding. Specifically, we: (i) Design a new visual encoder called Hybrid Encoder that not only encodes individual sub-images but also interacts with detailed global visual features, significantly improving the model's ability to encode high-resolution images. (ii) Propose an optimal feature fusion strategy for the dynamic cropping approach, effectively leveraging information from different layers of the vision encoder. Compared with the state-of-the-art MLLMs under the same setting, our HyViLM outperforms existing MLLMs in nine out of ten tasks. Specifically, HyViLM achieves a 9.6% improvement in performance on the TextVQA task and a 6.9% enhancement on the DocVQA task.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Reprogramming Visual-Language Model for General Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02664v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of deepfake faces poses huge potential negative impacts on our daily lives. Despite substantial advancements in deepfake detection over these years, the generalizability of existing methods against forgeries from unseen datasets or created by emerging generative models remains constrained. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot advantages of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose a novel approach that repurposes a well-trained VLM for general deepfake detection. Motivated by the model reprogramming paradigm that manipulates the model prediction via data perturbations, our method can reprogram a pretrained VLM model (e.g., CLIP) solely based on manipulating its input without tuning the inner parameters. Furthermore, we insert a pseudo-word guided by facial identity into the text prompt. Extensive experiments on several popular benchmarks demonstrate that (1) the cross-dataset and cross-manipulation performances of deepfake detection can be significantly and consistently improved (e.g., over 88% AUC in cross-dataset setting from FF++ to WildDeepfake) using a pre-trained CLIP model with our proposed reprogramming method; (2) our superior performances are at less cost of trainable parameters, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Position-aware Guided Point Cloud Completion with CLIP Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08271v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud completion aims to recover partial geometric and topological shapes caused by equipment defects or limited viewpoints. Current methods either solely rely on the 3D coordinates of the point cloud to complete it or incorporate additional images with well-calibrated intrinsic parameters to guide the geometric estimation of the missing parts. Although these methods have achieved excellent performance by directly predicting the location of complete points, the extracted features lack fine-grained information regarding the location of the missing area. To address this issue, we propose a rapid and efficient method to expand an unimodal framework into a multimodal framework. This approach incorporates a position-aware module designed to enhance the spatial information of the missing parts through a weighted map learning mechanism. In addition, we establish a Point-Text-Image triplet corpus PCI-TI and MVP-TI based on the existing unimodal point cloud completion dataset and use the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP to provide richer detail information for 3D shapes, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI25 |
| **[AdvDreamer Unveils: Are Vision-Language Models Truly Ready for Real-World 3D Variations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03002v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have exhibited remarkable generalization capabilities, yet their robustness in dynamic real-world scenarios remains largely unexplored. To systematically evaluate VLMs' robustness to real-world 3D variations, we propose AdvDreamer, the first framework that generates physically reproducible adversarial 3D transformation (Adv-3DT) samples from single-view images. AdvDreamer integrates advanced generative techniques with two key innovations and aims to characterize the worst-case distributions of 3D variations from natural images. To ensure adversarial effectiveness and method generality, we introduce an Inverse Semantic Probability Objective that executes adversarial optimization on fundamental vision-text alignment spaces, which can be generalizable across different VLM architectures and downstream tasks. To mitigate the distribution discrepancy between generated and real-world samples while maintaining physical reproducibility, we design a Naturalness Reward Model that provides regularization feedback during adversarial optimization, preventing convergence towards hallucinated and unnatural elements. Leveraging AdvDreamer, we establish MM3DTBench, the first VQA dataset for benchmarking VLMs' 3D variations robustness. Extensive evaluations on representative VLMs with diverse architectures highlight that 3D variations in the real world may pose severe threats to model performance across various tasks.</p></details> | 11pages, 8 figures |
| **[TextRefiner: Internal Visual Feature as Efficient Refiner for Vision-Language Models Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08176v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the efficiency of prompt learning in transferring vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, existing methods mainly learn the prompts in a coarse-grained manner where the learned prompt vectors are shared across all categories. Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern class-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance for classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference costs. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to refine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal knowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module to encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the image branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with the original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and enrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any external expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66 % to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise features for text prompts. Equipped with TextRefiner, PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance and is efficient in inference.

This paper introduces Progressive multi-granular Vision-Language alignments (PromViL), a novel framework to enhance LVLMs' ability in performing grounded compositional visual reasoning tasks. Our approach constructs a hierarchical structure of multi-modal alignments, ranging from simple to complex concepts. By progressively aligning textual descriptions with corresponding visual regions, our model learns to leverage contextual information from lower levels to inform higher-level reasoning. To facilitate this learning process, we introduce a data generation process that creates a novel dataset derived from Visual Genome, providing a wide range of nested compositional vision-language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our PromViL framework significantly outperforms baselines on various visual grounding and compositional question answering tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing Syntax: Uncovering Syntactic Learning Limitations in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08111v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs), serve as foundation models for multi-modal applications such as image captioning and text-to-image generation. Recent studies have highlighted limitations in VLM text encoders, particularly in areas like compositionality and semantic understanding, though the underlying reasons for these limitations remain unclear. In this work, we aim to address this gap by analyzing the syntactic information, one of the fundamental linguistic properties, encoded by the text encoders of VLMs. We perform a thorough analysis comparing VLMs with different objective functions, parameter size and training data size, and with uni-modal language models (ULMs) in their ability to encode syntactic knowledge. Our findings suggest that ULM text encoders acquire syntactic information more effectively than those in VLMs. The syntactic information learned by VLM text encoders is shaped primarily by the pre-training objective, which plays a more crucial role than other factors such as model architecture, model size, or the volume of pre-training data. Models exhibit different layer-wise trends where CLIP performance dropped across layers while for other models, middle layers are rich in encoding syntactic knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Barking Up The Syntactic Tree: Enhancing VLM Training with Syntactic Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08110v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieved strong performance on a variety of tasks (e.g., image-text retrieval, visual question answering). However, most VLMs rely on coarse-grained image-caption pairs for alignment, relying on data volume to resolve ambiguities and ground linguistic concepts in images. The richer semantic and syntactic structure within text is largely overlooked. To address this, we propose HIerarchically STructured Learning (HIST) that enhances VLM training without any additional supervision, by hierarchically decomposing captions into the constituent Subject, Noun Phrases, and Composite Phrases. Entailment between these constituent components allows us to formulate additional regularization constraints on the VLM attention maps. Specifically, we introduce two novel loss functions: (1) Subject Loss, which aligns image content with the subject of corresponding phrase, acting as an entailment of standard contrastive/matching losses at the Phrase level; (2) Addition Loss, to balance attention across multiple objects. HIST is general, and can be applied to any VLM for which attention between vision and language can be computed; we illustrate its efficacy on BLIP and ALBEF. HIST outperforms baseline VLMs, achieving up to +9.8% improvement in visual grounding, +6.3% in multi-object referring segmentation, +1.1% in image-text retrieval, and +0.2% in visual question answering, underscoring the value of structuring learning in VLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Among such attacks, Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are especially powerful, as a single optimized perturbation can mislead the model across various input images. In this work, we introduce a novel UAP specifically designed for VLMs: the Doubly-Universal Adversarial Perturbation (Doubly-UAP), capable of universally deceiving VLMs across both image and text inputs. To successfully disrupt the vision encoder's fundamental process, we analyze the core components of the attention mechanism. After identifying value vectors in the middle-to-late layers as the most vulnerable, we optimize Doubly-UAP in a label-free manner with a frozen model. Despite being developed as a black-box to the LLM, Doubly-UAP achieves high attack success rates on VLMs, consistently outperforming baseline methods across vision-language tasks. Extensive ablation studies and analyses further demonstrate the robustness of Doubly-UAP and provide insights into how it influences internal attention mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Vision-language models (VLMs) marked a large step for the generalization capabilities and have been already applied to various tasks. Very recently, first approaches utilized VLMs for domain generalized segmentation and object detection and obtained strong generalization. However, all these approaches rely on complex modules, feature augmentation frameworks or additional models. Surprisingly and in contrast to that, we found that simple fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models yields competitive or even stronger generalization results while being extremely simple to apply. Moreover, we found that vision-language pre-training consistently provides better generalization than the previous standard of vision-only pre-training. This challenges the standard of using ImageNet-based transfer learning for domain generalization. Fully fine-tuning a vision-language pre-trained model is capable of reaching the domain generalization SOTA when training on the synthetic GTA5 dataset. Moreover, we confirm this observation for object detection on a novel synthetic-to-real benchmark. We further obtain superior generalization capabilities by reaching 77.9% mIoU on the popular Cityscapes-to-ACDC benchmark. We also found improved in-domain generalization, leading to an improved SOTA of 86.4% mIoU on the Cityscapes test set marking the first place on the leaderboard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024; Project Page: https://vltseg.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[DexDiff: Towards Extrinsic Dexterity Manipulation of Ungraspable Objects in Unrestricted Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05493v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grasping large and flat objects (e.g. a book or a pan) is often regarded as an ungraspable task, which poses significant challenges due to the unreachable grasping poses. Previous works leverage Extrinsic Dexterity like walls or table edges to grasp such objects. However, they are limited to task-specific policies and lack task planning to find pre-grasp conditions. This makes it difficult to adapt to various environments and extrinsic dexterity constraints. Therefore, we present DexDiff, a robust robotic manipulation method for long-horizon planning with extrinsic dexterity. Specifically, we utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to perceive the environmental state and generate high-level task plans, followed by a goal-conditioned action diffusion (GCAD) model to predict the sequence of low-level actions. This model learns the low-level policy from offline data with the cumulative reward guided by high-level planning as the goal condition, which allows for improved prediction of robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only effectively performs ungraspable tasks but also generalizes to previously unseen objects. It outperforms baselines by a 47% higher success rate in simulation and facilitates efficient deployment and manipulation in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[AmCLR: Unified Augmented Learning for Cross-Modal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07979v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has emerged as a pivotal framework for representation learning, underpinning advances in both unimodal and bimodal applications like SimCLR and CLIP. To address fundamental limitations like large batch size dependency and bimodality, methods such as SogCLR leverage stochastic optimization for the global contrastive objective. Inspired by SogCLR's efficiency and adaptability, we introduce AmCLR and xAmCLR objective functions tailored for bimodal vision-language models to further enhance the robustness of contrastive learning. AmCLR integrates diverse augmentations, including text paraphrasing and image transformations, to reinforce the alignment of contrastive representations, keeping batch size limited to a few hundred samples unlike CLIP which needs batch size of 32,768 to produce reasonable results. xAmCLR further extends this paradigm by incorporating intra-modal alignments between original and augmented modalities for richer feature learning. These advancements yield a more resilient and generalizable contrastive learning process, aimed at overcoming bottlenecks in scaling and augmentative diversity. Since we have built our framework on the existing SogCLR, we are able to demonstrate improved representation quality with fewer computational resources, establishing a foundation for scalable and robust multi-modal learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Just Shift It: Test-Time Prototype Shifting for Zero-Shot Generalization with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12952v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have propelled the field of computer vision, particularly in the zero-shot learning setting. Despite their promise, the effectiveness of these models often diminishes due to domain shifts in test environments. To address this, we introduce the Test-Time Prototype Shifting (TPS) framework, a pioneering approach designed to adapt VLMs to test datasets using unlabeled test inputs. Our method is based on the notion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By pre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text encoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for subsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current advancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift vectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively bridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect of our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands when compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations across 15 image classification datasets involving natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset generalization, as well as in context-dependent visual reasoning, demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing resource requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[RADIO Amplified: Improved Baselines for Agglomerative Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07679v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agglomerative models have recently emerged as a powerful approach to training vision foundation models, leveraging multi-teacher distillation from existing models such as CLIP, DINO, and SAM. This strategy enables the efficient creation of robust models, combining the strengths of individual teachers while significantly reducing computational and resource demands. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze state-of-the-art agglomerative models, identifying critical challenges including resolution mode shifts, teacher imbalance, idiosyncratic teacher artifacts, and an excessive number of output tokens. To address these issues, we propose several novel solutions: multi-resolution training, mosaic augmentation, and improved balancing of teacher loss functions. Specifically, in the context of Vision Language Models, we introduce a token compression technique to maintain high-resolution information within a fixed token count. We release our top-performing models, available in multiple scales (-B, -L, -H, and -g), alongside inference code and pretrained weights.</p></details> |  |

In the study of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), when implementing ICL, researchers usually adopts the naive strategies like fixed demonstrations across different samples, or selecting demonstrations directly via a visual-language embedding model. These methods does not guarantee the configured demonstrations fit the need of the LVLMs. To address this issue, we now propose a novel framework, \underline{d}emonstration \underline{r}etriever for large m\underline{u}lti-modal \underline{m}odel (DRUM), which fine-tunes the visual-language embedding model to better meet the LVLM's needs. First, we discuss the retrieval strategies for a visual-language task, assuming an embedding model is given. And we propose to concate the image and text embeddings to enhance the retrieval performance. Second, we propose to re-rank the demonstrations retrieved by the embedding model via the LVLM's feedbacks, and calculate a list-wise ranking loss for training the embedding model. Third, we propose an iterative demonstration mining strategy to improve the training of the embedding model. Through extensive experiments on 3 types of visual-language tasks, 7 benchmark datasets, our DRUM framework is proven to be effective in boosting the LVLM's in-context learning performance via retrieving more proper demonstrations.</p></details> |  |

But evaluating VLMs for an application requirement using a standardized framework in practical settings is still challenging. This paper aims to solve that using an end-to-end framework. We present VQA360 - a novel dataset derived from established VQA benchmarks, annotated with task types, application domains, and knowledge types, for a comprehensive evaluation. We also introduce GoEval, a multimodal evaluation metric developed using GPT-4o, achieving a correlation factor of 56.71% with human judgments. Our experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that no single model excels universally, thus, making a right choice a key design decision. Proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini generally outperform others, but open-source models like InternVL-2-8B and CogVLM-2-Llama-3-19B also demonstrate competitive strengths, while providing additional advantages. Our framework can also be extended to other tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages + references + 6 pages of Appendix</p></details> |
| **[Hallucination Elimination and Semantic Enhancement Framework for Vision-Language Models in Traffic Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07518v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation tasks. However, these models occasionally generate hallucinatory texts, resulting in descriptions that seem reasonable but do not correspond to the image. This phenomenon can lead to wrong driving decisions of the autonomous driving system. To address this challenge, this paper proposes HCOENet, a plug-and-play chain-of-thought correction method designed to eliminate object hallucinations and generate enhanced descriptions for critical objects overlooked in the initial response. Specifically, HCOENet employs a cross-checking mechanism to filter entities and directly extracts critical objects from the given image, enriching the descriptive text. Experimental results on the POPE benchmark demonstrate that HCOENet improves the F1-score of the Mini-InternVL-4B and mPLUG-Owl3 models by 12.58% and 4.28%, respectively. Additionally, qualitative results using images collected in open campus scene further highlight the practical applicability of the proposed method. Compared with the GPT-4o model, HCOENet achieves comparable descriptive performance while significantly reducing costs. Finally, two novel semantic understanding datasets, CODA_desc and nuScenes_desc, are created for traffic scenarios to support future research. The codes and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/fjq-tongji/HCOENet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Vision-Language Model Pre-training with Image-text Pair Pruning Based on Word Frequency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10879v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Word-Frequency-based Image-Text Pair Pruning (WFPP), a novel data pruning method that improves the efficiency of VLMs. Unlike MetaCLIP, our method does not need metadata for pruning, but selects text-image pairs to prune based on the content of the text. Specifically, WFPP prunes text-image pairs containing high-frequency words across the entire training dataset. The effect of WFPP is to reduce the dominance of frequent words. The result a better balanced word-frequency distribution in the dataset, which is known to improve the training of word embedding models. After pre-training on the pruned subset, we fine-tuned the model on the entire dataset for one additional epoch to achieve better performance. Our experiments demonstrate that applying WFPP when training a CLIP model improves performance on a wide range of downstream tasks. WFPP also provides the advantage of speeding up pre-training by using fewer samples. Additionally, we analyze the training data before and after pruning to visualize how WFPP changes the balance of word frequencies. We hope our work encourages researchers to consider the distribution of words in the training data when pre-training VLMs, not limited to CLIP.</p></details> |  |

Notably, the MLLMs are constrained by their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing long videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens, their strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a novel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification capacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special token, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video, which summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated KV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing strategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small (easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation, which integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the scarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further improved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based on the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's effectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior long-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of comparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively preserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x compression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling high-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.</p></details> |  |

However, the current works are normally optimized by golden action trajectories or ideal task-oriented solutions toward a definitive goal. This paradigm considers limited user-oriented factors, which could be the reason for their performance reduction in a wide range of personal assistant applications. To address this, we propose Chain-of-User-Thought (COUT), a novel embodied reasoning paradigm that takes a chain of thought from basic action thinking to explicit and implicit personalized preference thought to incorporate personalized factors into autonomous agent learning. To target COUT, we introduce SmartAgent, an agent framework perceiving cyber environments and reasoning personalized requirements as 1) interacting with GUI to access an item pool, 2) generating users' explicit requirements implied by previous actions, and 3) recommending items to fulfill users' implicit requirements. To demonstrate SmartAgent's capabilities, we also create a brand-new dataset SmartSpot that offers a full-stage personalized action-involved environment. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to formulate the COUT process, serving as a preliminary attempt towards embodied personalized agent learning. Our extensive experiments on SmartSpot illuminate SmartAgent's functionality among a series of embodied and personalized sub-tasks. We will release code and data upon paper notification at \url{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SmartAgent}.</p></details> |  |

Distilling high level knowledge about all these quality bearing attributes is crucial for developing objective Image Quality Assessment (IQA).While existing solutions have modeled some of these aspects, a comprehensive solution that involves all these important quality related attributes has not yet been developed. In this paper, we present a new blind IQA (BIQA) model termed Self-supervision and Vision-Language supervision Image QUality Evaluator (SLIQUE) that features a joint vision-language and visual contrastive representation learning framework for acquiring high level knowledge about the images semantic contents, distortion characteristics and appearance properties for IQA. For training SLIQUE, we have developed a systematic approach to constructing a first of its kind large image database annotated with all three categories of quality relevant texts. The Text Annotated Distortion, Appearance and Content (TADAC) database has over 1.6 million images annotated with textual descriptions of their semantic contents, distortion characteristics and appearance properties. The method for constructing TADAC and the database itself will be particularly useful for exploiting vision-language modeling for advanced IQA applications. Extensive experimental results show that SLIQUE has superior performances over state of the art, demonstrating the soundness of its design principle and the effectiveness of its implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, \c{opyright} 2024 IEEE.

Process of Elimination using Multi-Modal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07148v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Multiple Choice Reasoning via. Process of Elimination using Multi-Modal models, herein referred to as Multi-Modal Process of Elimination (MM-PoE). This novel methodology is engineered to augment the efficacy of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in multiple-choice visual reasoning tasks. Diverging from conventional approaches that evaluate each option independently, MM-PoE employs a dual-step scoring paradigm that initially identifies and excludes implausible choices, subsequently concentrating on the most probable remaining options. This method emulates human test-taking strategies, where individuals typically eliminate clearly incorrect answers prior to selecting the optimal response. Our empirical evaluations, conducted across three benchmark datasets, reveal that MM-PoE significantly improves both zero-shot and few-shot performance of contemporary state-of-the-art VLMs. Critically, this approach not only broadens the application of the elimination process to multi-modal contexts but also allows few-shot experiments, thereby addressing two principal limitations concerning usage of PoE only in zero-shot settings and only with a language-only framework. As a result, MM-PoE not only refines the reasoning capabilities of VLMs but also broadens their applicability to complex visual question-answering scenarios. All code and documentation supporting our work are available at https://pypi.org/project/mm-poe/, enabling researchers and practitioners to easily integrate and further develop these techniques.</p></details> |  |

While performing well in multi-modal reasoning and multi-turn conversations, the existing models lack pixel-level understanding and struggle with multi-image inputs. In this work, we propose RSUniVLM, a unified, end-to-end RS VLM designed for comprehensive vision understanding across multiple granularity, including image-level, region-level, and pixel-level tasks. RSUniVLM also performs effectively in multi-image analysis, with instances of change detection and change captioning. To enhance the model's ability to capture visual information at different levels without increasing model size, we design a novel architecture called Granularity-oriented Mixture of Experts to constraint the model to about 1 billion parameters. We also construct a large-scale RS instruction-following dataset based on a variety of existing datasets in both RS and general domain, encompassing various tasks such as object localization, visual question answering, and semantic segmentation. Substantial experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed RSUniVLM up to state-of-the-art across various RS tasks.

| **[Maya: An Instruction Finetuned Multilingual Multimodal Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07112v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has led to impressive results on academic benchmarks, primarily in widely spoken languages. However, significant gaps remain in the ability of current VLMs to handle low-resource languages and varied cultural contexts, largely due to a lack of high-quality, diverse, and safety-vetted data. Consequently, these models often struggle to understand low-resource languages and cultural nuances in a manner free from toxicity. To address these limitations, we introduce Maya, an open-source Multimodal Multilingual model. Our contributions are threefold: 1) a multilingual image-text pretraining dataset in eight languages, based on the LLaVA pretraining dataset; 2) a thorough analysis of toxicity within the LLaVA dataset, followed by the creation of a novel toxicity-free version across eight languages; and 3) a multilingual image-text model supporting these languages, enhancing cultural and linguistic comprehension in vision-language tasks.

These capabilities allow models to understand and respond to previously unseen data without task-specific training. However, adapting CLIP to integrate specialized knowledge from various domains while retaining its zero-shot capabilities remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a novel prompt ensemble learning approach called Group-wise Prompt Ensemble (GPE). This method aims to enhance CLIP's zero-shot capabilities by incorporating new domain knowledge while improving its adaptability and robustness against data distribution shifts. Our approach hinges on three main strategies: prompt grouping with masked attention to optimize CLIP's adaptability while safeguarding its zero-shot capabilities; the incorporation of auxiliary prompts for the seamless integration of new domain insights without disrupting the original model's representation; and an ensemble learning strategy that effectively merges original and new knowledge. Through rigorous experimentation, including more challenging cross-dataset transfer evaluations, our GPE method redefines the benchmarks for the adaptability and efficiency of vision-language models, surpassing existing models across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025</p></details> |

Towards that goal, it is important to understand the 3D reasoning capabilities of current models as well as identify the gaps between these models and humans. Therefore, we construct a new 3D visual understanding benchmark named UniQA-3D. UniQA-3D covers fundamental 3D vision tasks in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specialized models, and human subjects on it. Our results show that VLMs generally perform poorly, while the specialized models are accurate but not robust, failing under geometric perturbations. In contrast, human vision continues to be the most reliable 3D visual system. We further demonstrate that neural networks align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms compared to classical computer vision methods, and Transformer-based networks such as ViT align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms than CNNs. We hope our study will benefit the future development of foundation models for 3D vision.

To address this, recent approaches apply contrastive decoding to calibrate the model's response via contrasting output distributions with original and visually distorted samples, demonstrating promising hallucination mitigation in a training-free manner. However, the potential of changing information in visual inputs is not well-explored, so a deeper investigation into the behaviors of visual contrastive decoding is of great interest. In this paper, we first explore various methods for contrastive decoding to change visual contents, including image downsampling and editing. Downsampling images reduces the detailed textual information while editing yields new contents in images, providing new aspects as visual contrastive samples. To further study benefits by using different contrastive samples, we analyze probability-level metrics, including entropy and distribution distance. Interestingly, the effect of these samples in mitigating hallucinations varies a lot across LVLMs and benchmarks. Based on our analysis, we propose a simple yet effective method to combine contrastive samples, offering a practical solution for applying contrastive decoding across various scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed fusion method among different benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Unlike traditional methods that prioritize either high-level semantics (e.g., CLIP) or pixel-level reconstruction (e.g., VAE), ViLex simultaneously captures rich semantic content and fine visual details, enabling high-quality image generation and comprehensive visual scene understanding. Through a self-supervised learning pipeline, ViLex generates tokens optimized for reconstructing input images using a frozen text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, preserving the detailed information necessary for high-fidelity semantic-level reconstruction. As an image embedding in the language space, ViLex tokens leverage the compositionality of natural languages, allowing them to be used independently as "text tokens" or combined with natural language tokens to prompt pretrained T2I models with both visual and textual inputs, mirroring how we interact with vision-language models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that ViLex achieves higher fidelity in image reconstruction compared to text embeddings--even with a single ViLex token. Moreover, ViLex successfully performs various DreamBooth tasks in a zero-shot, unsupervised manner without fine-tuning T2I models. Additionally, ViLex serves as a powerful vision encoder, consistently improving vision-language model performance across 15 benchmarks relative to a strong SigLIP baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report. 16 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in enabling this shift. Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leverage the large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries and are accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many more types of tasks. Our work presents a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs across a spectrum of engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas: Conceptual Design, System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing and Inspection, and Engineering Education Tasks. Specifically in this paper, we assess the capabilities of two VLMs, GPT-4V and LLaVA 1.6 34B, in design tasks such as sketch similarity analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization, manufacturability assessment, and engineering textbook problems. Through this structured evaluation, we not only explore VLMs' proficiency in handling complex design challenges but also identify their limitations in complex engineering design applications. Our research establishes a foundation for future assessments of vision language models. It also contributes a set of benchmark testing datasets, with more than 1000 queries, for ongoing advancements and applications in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, existing studies typically focus on the reasoning based on a single image and heavily depend on text prompting, limiting their ability to learn comprehensive understanding from multiple images. To address this, we propose an effective yet efficient approach that reframes the CLIP model into a learning-to-rank task and introduces a lightweight adapter to augment CLIP for text-guided image ranking. Specifically, our approach incorporates learnable prompts to adapt to new instructions for ranking purposes and an auxiliary branch with ranking-aware attention, leveraging text-conditioned visual differences for additional supervision in image ranking. Our ranking-aware adapter consistently outperforms fine-tuned CLIPs on various tasks and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art models designed for specific tasks like facial age estimation and image quality assessment. Overall, our approach primarily focuses on ranking images with a single instruction, which provides a natural and generalized way of learning from visual differences across images, bypassing the need for extensive text prompts tailored to individual tasks.

To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended Benchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation datasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to generate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding to specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets, ONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by the original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most importantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting and aggregating sample-level tests. The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two challenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the aggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing models evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we explore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores. Our aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering ground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking with less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm provides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores. We also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing evaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We introduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language models, unifying evaluations across these domains. Overall, we present a technique for open-ended evaluation, which can aggregate over incomplete, heterogeneous sample-level measurements to continually grow a benchmark alongside the rapidly developing foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Narrow Gate: Localized Image-Text Communication in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06646v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal training have significantly improved the integration of image understanding and generation within a unified model. This study investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understanding tasks, specifically focusing on how visual information is processed and transferred to the textual domain. We compare VLMs that generate both images and text with those that output only text, highlighting key differences in information flow. We find that in models with multimodal outputs, image and text embeddings are more separated within the residual stream. Additionally, models vary in how information is exchanged from visual to textual tokens. VLMs that only output text exhibit a distributed communication pattern, where information is exchanged through multiple image tokens. In contrast, models trained for image and text generation rely on a single token that acts as a narrow gate for the visual information. We demonstrate that ablating this single token significantly deteriorates performance on image understanding tasks. Furthermore, modifying this token enables effective steering of the image semantics, showing that targeted, local interventions can reliably control the model's global behavior.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by 31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zhoues.github.io/Code-as-Monitor/</p></details> |

New materials, like perovskites-based memristors are recently attractive due to their cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and flexibility. Yet, challenges in material diversity and immature fabrications require extensive experimentation for device development. Moreover, significant non-idealities in these memristors often impede them for computing. Here, we propose a synergistic methodology to concurrently optimize perovskite memristor fabrication and develop robust analog DNNs that effectively address the inherent non-idealities of these memristors. Employing Bayesian optimization (BO) with a focus on usability, we efficiently identify optimal materials and fabrication conditions for perovskite memristors. Meanwhile, we developed "BayesMulti", a DNN training strategy utilizing BO-guided noise injection to improve the resistance of analog DNNs to memristor imperfections. Our approach theoretically ensures that within a certain range of parameter perturbations due to memristor non-idealities, the prediction outcomes remain consistent. Our integrated approach enables use of analog computing in much deeper and wider networks, which significantly outperforms existing methods in diverse tasks like image classification, autonomous driving, species identification, and large vision-language models, achieving up to 100-fold improvements. We further validate our methodology on a 10$\times$10 optimized perovskite memristor crossbar, demonstrating high accuracy in a classification task and low energy consumption.

Our method is a key component for language-assisted teleoperation and human-robot cooperation, where human operators can instruct the robots where to place their support contacts before whole-body reaching or manipulation using natural language. Words2Contact transforms the verbal instructions of a human operator into contact placement predictions; it also deals with iterative corrections, until the human is satisfied with the contact location identified in the robot's field of view. We benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs for size and performance in contact prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the iterative correction process, showing that users, even naive, quickly learn how to instruct the system to obtain accurate locations. Finally, we validate Words2Contact in real-world experiments with the Talos humanoid robot, instructed by human operators to place support contacts on different locations and surfaces to avoid falling when reaching for distant objects.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Dropout Decoding, a novel inference-time approach that quantifies the uncertainty of visual tokens and selectively masks uncertain tokens to improve decoding. Our method measures the uncertainty of each visual token by projecting it onto the text space and decomposing it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Specifically, we focus on epistemic uncertainty, which captures perception-related errors more effectively. Inspired by dropout regularization, we introduce uncertainty-guided token dropout, which applies the dropout principle to input visual tokens instead of model parameters, and during inference rather than training. By aggregating predictions from an ensemble of masked decoding contexts, Dropout Decoding robustly mitigates errors arising from visual token misinterpretations. Evaluations on benchmarks including CHAIR, THRONE, and MMBench demonstrate that Dropout Decoding significantly reduces object hallucinations (OH) and enhances both reliability and quality of LVLM outputs across diverse visual contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is released at https://github.com/kigb/DropoutDecoding</p></details> |

To enhance inference efficiency, most existing approaches depend on parameter-dependent or token-dependent strategies to reduce computational demands. However, these methods typically require complex training processes and struggle to consistently select the most relevant tokens. In this paper, we systematically analyze the above challenges and provide a series of valuable insights for inference acceleration. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, the Pruning All-Rounder (PAR). Different from previous works, PAR develops a meta-router to adaptively organize pruning flows across both tokens and layers. With a self-supervised learning manner, our method achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency. Notably, PAR is highly flexible, offering multiple pruning versions to address a range of pruning scenarios. The code for this work will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Vision-Language Model with Fine-grained Semantics for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16278v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive research, open-vocabulary segmentation methods still struggle to generalize across diverse domains. To reduce the computational cost of adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) while preserving their pre-trained knowledge, most methods freeze the VLMs for mask classification and train only the mask generator. However, our comprehensive analysis reveals a surprising insight: open-vocabulary segmentation is primarily bottlenecked by mask classification, not mask generation. This discovery prompts us to rethink the existing paradigm and explore an alternative approach. Instead of freezing the VLM, we propose to freeze the pre-trained mask generator and focus on optimizing the mask classifier. Building on the observation that VLMs pre-trained on global-pooled image-text features often fail to capture fine-grained semantics necessary for effective mask classification, we propose a novel Fine-grained Semantic Adaptation (FISA) method to address this limitation. FISA enhances the extracted visual features with fine-grained semantic awareness by explicitly integrating this crucial semantic information early in the visual encoding process. As our method strategically optimizes only a small portion of the VLM's parameters, it enjoys the efficiency of adapting to new data distributions while largely preserving the valuable VLM pre-trained knowledge. Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of our approach. Notably, FISA achieves new state-of-the-art results across multiple representative benchmarks, improving performance by up to +1.0 PQ and +3.0 mIoU and reduces training costs by nearly 5x compared to previous best methods. Our code and data will be made public.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

While general VLMs, such as GPT-4V, demonstrate strong performance across various tasks, their proficiency in GUI grounding remains suboptimal. Recent studies have focused on fine-tuning these models specifically for one-shot GUI grounding, yielding significant improvements over baseline performance. We introduce a visual prompting framework that employs an iterative narrowing mechanism to further improve the performance of both general and fine-tuned models in GUI grounding. For evaluation, we tested our method on a comprehensive benchmark comprising various UI platforms and provided the code to reproduce our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/ant-8/GUI-Grounding-via-Iterative-Narrowing</p></details> |

Existing methods often rely on additional reference data, isolated components for distribution or domain predictions, leading to high training costs, increased inference complexity, and limited improvement potential for pre-trained models. To address these challenges, we first comprehensively analyze the effects of parameter update locations and ranks on downstream adaptation and knowledge retention. Based on these insights, we propose Dynamic Rank-Selective Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a universal and efficient CL approach that adaptively assigns ranks to LoRA modules based on their relevance to the current data. Unlike prior methods, our approach continually enhances the pre-trained VLM by retaining both the pre-trained knowledge and the knowledge acquired during CL. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit domain or distribution prediction and additional reference data, enabling seamless integration of new tasks while preserving pre-trained capabilities. It also maintains the original architecture and deployment pipeline of the pre-trained model without incurring any additional inference overhead. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in continually absorbing knowledge of downstream tasks while retaining pre-trained knowledge.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, annotating such images poses significant challenges due to the need for specialized domain expertise. We present NADA (no annotations for detection in art), a pipeline that leverages diffusion models' art-related knowledge for object detection in paintings without the need for full bounding box supervision. Our method, which supports both weakly-supervised and zero-shot scenarios and does not require any fine-tuning of its pretrained components, consists of a class proposer based on large vision-language models and a class-conditioned detector based on Stable Diffusion. NADA is evaluated on two artwork datasets, ArtDL 2.0 and IconArt, outperforming prior work in weakly-supervised detection, while being the first work for zero-shot object detection in art.

While some previous methods have explored directly pruning or merging tokens in the inference stage to accelerate models, our method excels in both performance and throughput by two key designs. First, while most previous methods only try to save the computations of Large Language Models (LLMs), our method accelerates the forward pass of both image encoders and LLMs in LVLMs, which both occupy a significant part of time during inference. Second, our method recycles the beneficial information from the pruned tokens into existing tokens, which avoids directly dropping context tokens like previous methods to cause performance loss. iLLaVA can nearly 2$\times$ the throughput, and reduce the memory costs by half with only a 0.2\% - 0.5\% performance drop across models of different scales including 7B, 13B and 34B. On tasks across different domains including single-image, multi-images and videos, iLLaVA demonstrates strong generalizability with consistently promising efficiency. We finally offer abundant visualizations to show the merging processes of iLLaVA in each step, which show insights into the distribution of computing resources in LVLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hulianyuyy/iLLaVA.</p></details> |  |

It helps demystify the decision-making processes of large vision-language models (LVLMs) through the use of language models. While existing methods for creating a Vision Question-Answering with Natural Language Explanation (VQA-NLE) datasets can provide explanations, they heavily rely on human annotations that are time-consuming and costly. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages LVLMs to efficiently generate high-quality synthetic VQA-NLE datasets. By evaluating our synthetic data, we showcase how advanced prompting techniques can lead to the production of high-quality VQA-NLE data. Our findings indicate that this proposed method achieves up to 20x faster than human annotation, with only a minimal decrease in qualitative metrics, achieving robust quality that is nearly equivalent to human-annotated data. Furthermore, we show that incorporating visual prompts significantly enhances the relevance of text generation. Our study paves the way for a more efficient and robust automated generation of multi-modal NLE data, offering a promising solution to the problem.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[DenseVLM: A Retrieval and Decoupled Alignment Framework for Open-Vocabulary Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06244v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot recognition capability, but still underperform in dense prediction tasks. Self-distillation recently is emerging as a promising approach for fine-tuning VLMs to better adapt to local regions without requiring extensive annotations. However, previous state-of-the-art approaches often suffer from significant `foreground bias', where models tend to wrongly identify background regions as foreground objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. By leveraging the pre-trained VLM to retrieve categories for unlabeled regions, DenseVLM effectively decouples the interference between foreground and background region features, ensuring that each region is accurately aligned with its corresponding category. We show that DenseVLM can be seamlessly integrated into open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation tasks, leading to notable performance improvements. Furthermore, it exhibits promising zero-shot scalability when training on more extensive and diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

Color illusion, where a person's visual system perceives color differently from actual color, is well-studied in human vision. However, it remains underexplored whether vision-language models (VLMs), trained on large-scale human data, exhibit similar perceptual biases when confronted with such color illusions. We propose an automated framework for generating color illusion images, resulting in RCID (Realistic Color Illusion Dataset), a dataset of 19,000 realistic illusion images. Our experiments show that all studied VLMs exhibit perceptual biases similar human vision. Finally, we train a model to distinguish both human perception and actual pixel differences.</p></details> |  |

However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available in https://github.com/aiming-lab/MMedPO.</p></details> |  |

However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks. In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding. Our contributions include: (1) A carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components. (2) A parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters. (3) Significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

For this, VLMs deterministically map images and text descriptions to a joint latent space in which their similarity is assessed using the cosine similarity. However, a deterministic mapping of inputs fails to capture uncertainties over concepts arising from domain shifts when used in downstream tasks. In this work, we propose post-hoc uncertainty estimation in VLMs that does not require additional training. Our method leverages a Bayesian posterior approximation over the last layers in VLMs and analytically quantifies uncertainties over cosine similarities. We demonstrate its effectiveness for uncertainty quantification and support set selection in active learning. Compared to baselines, we obtain improved and well-calibrated predictive uncertainties, interpretable uncertainty estimates, and sample-efficient active learning. Our results show promise for safety-critical applications of large-scale models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aaltoml.github.io/BayesVLM/</p></details> |

The advent of powerful tools such as large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of these robots in environmental perception and decision-making. However, the introduction of these intelligent agents has led to security threats such as jailbreak attacks and adversarial attacks. In this research, we take a further step by proposing a backdoor attack specifically targeting robotic manipulation and, for the first time, implementing backdoor attack in the physical world. By embedding a backdoor visual language model into the visual perception module within the robotic system, we successfully mislead the robotic arm's operation in the physical world, given the presence of common items as triggers.

Although recently pretrained vision-language models demonstrate strong zero-shot performance across various visual tasks, they focus on learning class semantics, which makes their direct application to ZSAD challenging. To address this scenario, we propose GlocalCLIP, which uniquely separates global and local prompts and jointly optimizes them. This approach enables the object-agnostic glocal semantic prompt to effectively capture general normal and anomalous patterns without dependency on specific objects in the image. We refine the text prompts for more precise adjustments by utilizing deep-text prompt tuning in the text encoder. In the vision encoder, we apply V-V attention layers to capture detailed local image features. Finally, we introduce glocal contrastive learning to improve the complementary learning of global and local prompts, effectively detecting anomalous patterns across various domains. The generalization performance of GlocalCLIP in ZSAD was demonstrated on 15 real-world datasets from both the industrial and medical domains, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Recent continual learning approaches often leverage the vision-language model CLIP for its high-dimensional feature space and cross-modality feature matching. Traditional CLIP-based classification methods identify the most similar text label for a test image by comparing their embeddings. However, these methods are sensitive to the quality of text phrases and less effective for classes lacking meaningful text labels. In this work, we rethink CLIP-based continual learning and introduce the concept of Label Vector Pool (LVP). LVP replaces text labels with training images as similarity references, eliminating the need for ideal text descriptions. We present three variations of LVP and evaluate their performance on class and domain incremental learning tasks. Leveraging CLIP's high dimensional feature space, LVP learning algorithms are task-order invariant. The new knowledge does not modify the old knowledge, hence, there is minimum forgetting. Different tasks can be learned independently and in parallel with low computational and memory demands. Experimental results show that proposed LVP-based methods outperform the current state-of-the-art baseline by a significant margin of 40.7%.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to CVPR2025</p></details> |

Most benchmarks focus on typical visual scenarios, making it difficult to discern whether model performance stems from keen perception and reasoning skills, or reliance on pure statistical recall. We argue that by focusing on atypical events in videos, clearer insights can be gained on the core capabilities of VLMs. Explaining and understanding such out-of-distribution events requires models to extend beyond basic pattern recognition and regurgitation of their prior knowledge. To this end, we introduce BlackSwanSuite, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to reason about unexpected events through abductive and defeasible tasks. Our tasks artificially limit the amount of visual information provided to models while questioning them about hidden unexpected events, or provide new visual information that could change an existing hypothesis about the event. We curate a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising over 3,800 MCQ, 4,900 generative and 6,700 yes/no tasks, spanning 1,655 videos. After extensively evaluating various state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source VLMs such as LLaVA-Video, we find significant performance gaps of up to 32% from humans on these tasks.

However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications.

Previous studies have highlighted VLMs' vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, where carefully crafted inputs can lead the model to produce content that violates ethical and legal standards. However, existing methods struggle against state-of-the-art VLMs like GPT-4o, due to the over-exposure of harmful content and lack of stealthy malicious guidance. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework: Multi-Modal Linkage (MML) Attack. Drawing inspiration from cryptography, MML utilizes an encryption-decryption process across text and image modalities to mitigate over-exposure of malicious information. To align the model's output with malicious intent covertly, MML employs a technique called "evil alignment", framing the attack within a video game production scenario. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MML's effectiveness. Specifically, MML jailbreaks GPT-4o with attack success rates of 97.80% on SafeBench, 98.81% on MM-SafeBench and 99.07% on HADES-Dataset.

Recent modeling work has attempted to understand the gap between models' and humans' data efficiency by constructing models trained on less data, especially multimodal naturalistic data. However, such models are often evaluated on adult-level benchmarks, with limited breadth in language abilities tested, and without direct comparison to behavioral data. We introduce DevBench, a multimodal benchmark comprising seven language evaluation tasks spanning the domains of lexical, syntactic, and semantic ability, with behavioral data from both children and adults. We evaluate a set of vision-language models on these tasks, comparing models and humans not only on accuracy but on their response patterns. Across tasks, models exhibit variation in their closeness to human response patterns, and models that perform better on a task also more closely resemble human behavioral responses. We also examine the developmental trajectory of OpenCLIP over training, finding that greater training results in closer approximations to adult response patterns. DevBench thus provides a benchmark for comparing models to human language development. These comparisons highlight ways in which model and human language learning processes diverge, providing insight into entry points for improving language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024 (Oral)</p></details> |

The literature addresses this problem by learning a linear classifier of the frozen visual features, optimizing word embeddings, or learning external feature adapters. This paper introduces an alternative way for CLIP adaptation without adding 'external' parameters to optimize. We find that simply fine-tuning the last projection matrix of the vision encoder leads to performance better than all baselines. Furthermore, we show that regularizing training with the distance between the fine-tuned and pretrained matrices adds reliability for adapting CLIP. This simple approach, coined ProLIP, yields state-of-the-art performance on 11 few-shot classification benchmarks, few-shot domain generalization, cross-dataset transfer, base-to-new class generalization, and test-time adaptation.

Participants compete to optimize language model training on a fixed language data budget of 100 million words or less. This year, we released improved text corpora, as well as a vision-and-language corpus to facilitate research into cognitively plausible vision language models. Submissions were compared on evaluation tasks targeting grammatical ability, (visual) question answering, pragmatic abilities, and grounding, among other abilities. Participants could submit to a 10M-word text-only track, a 100M-word text-only track, and/or a 100M-word and image multimodal track. From 31 submissions employing diverse methods, a hybrid causal-masked language model architecture outperformed other approaches. No submissions outperformed the baselines in the multimodal track. In follow-up analyses, we found a strong relationship between training FLOPs and average performance across tasks, and that the best-performing submissions proposed changes to the training data, training objective, and model architecture. This year's BabyLM Challenge shows that there is still significant room for innovation in this setting, in particular for image-text modeling, but community-driven research can yield actionable insights about effective strategies for small-scale language modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18857v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) embed aligned image-text pairs into a joint space but often rely on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between images and texts. This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an "uncertainty token" without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

| **[$S^3$: Synonymous Semantic Space for Improving Zero-Shot Generalization of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04925v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many studies have been conducted to enhance the zero-shot generalization ability of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) by addressing the semantic misalignment between image and text embeddings in downstream tasks. Although many efforts have been made, existing methods barely consider the fact that a class of images can be described by notably different textual concepts due to well-known lexical variation in natural language processing, which heavily affects the zero-shot generalization of CLIP. Therefore, this paper proposes a \textbf{S}ynonymous \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{S}pace ($S^3$) for each image class, rather than relying on a single textual concept, achieving more stable semantic alignment and improving the zero-shot generalization of CLIP. Specifically, our $S^3$ method first generates several synonymous concepts based on the label of each class by using large language models, and constructs a continuous yet compact synonymous semantic space based on the Vietoris-Rips complex of the generated synonymous concepts. Furthermore, we explore the effect of several point-to-space metrics on our $S^3$, while presenting a point-to-local-center metric to compute similarity between image embeddings and the synonymous semantic space of each class, accomplishing effective zero-shot predictions. Extensive experiments are conducted across 17 benchmarks, including fine-grained zero-shot classification, natural distribution zero-shot classification, and open-vocabulary segmentation, and the results show that our $S^3$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing vision-language models, which primarily rely on backbone architectures or CLIP-based embedding learning, demonstrate inherent limitations in fine-grained spatial localization and operational capabilities. This paper introduces SJTU: Spatial Judgments in Multimodal Models - Towards Unified Segmentation through Coordinate Detection, a framework that leverages spatial coordinate understanding to bridge vision-language interaction and precise segmentation, enabling accurate target identification through natural language instructions. The framework presents an approach for integrating segmentation techniques with vision-language models through spatial inference in multimodal space. By utilizing normalized coordinate detection for bounding boxes and transforming them into actionable segmentation outputs, we establish a connection between spatial and language representations in multimodal architectures. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across benchmark datasets, achieving IoU scores of 0.5958 on COCO 2017 and 0.6758 on Pascal VOC. Testing on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with 512x512 resolution images yields an average inference time of 7 seconds per image, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in both accuracy and practical deployability.

Recently, LLM providers have evolved these models into large vision-language models (LVLM), which shows prominent multi-modal understanding capabilities. Then, how can we leverage this multi-modal power for layout generation? To answer this, we propose Visual-Aware Self-Correction LAyout GeneRation (VASCAR) for LVLM-based content-aware layout generation. In our method, LVLMs iteratively refine their outputs with reference to rendered layout images, which are visualized as colored bounding boxes on poster backgrounds. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method combined with the Gemini. Without any additional training, VASCAR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) layout generation quality outperforming both existing layout-specific generative models and other LLM-based methods.</p></details> |  |

This is primarily due to the fact that they do not scale to utilizing a large number of frames. In order to address this limitation, we propose Espresso, a novel method that extracts and compresses spatial and temporal information separately. Through extensive evaluations, we show that spatial and temporal compression in Espresso each have a positive impact on the long-form video understanding capabilities; when combined, their positive impact increases. Furthermore, we show that Espresso's performance scales well with more training data, and that Espresso is far more effective than the existing projectors for VLMs in long-form video understanding. Moreover, we devise a more difficult evaluation setting for EgoSchema called "needle-in-a-haystack" that multiplies the lengths of the input videos. Espresso achieves SOTA performance on this task, outperforming the SOTA VLMs that have been trained on much more training data.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Scaling Inference-Time Search with Vision Value Model for Improved Visual Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03704v2)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), there lacks effective approaches to enhance response quality by scaling inference-time computation. This capability is known to be a core step towards the self-improving models in recent large language model studies. In this paper, we present Vision Value Model (VisVM) that can guide VLM inference-time search to generate responses with better visual comprehension. Specifically, VisVM not only evaluates the generated sentence quality in the current search step, but also anticipates the quality of subsequent sentences that may result from the current step, thus providing a long-term value. In this way, VisVM steers VLMs away from generating sentences prone to hallucinations or insufficient detail, thereby producing higher quality responses. Experimental results demonstrate that VisVM-guided search significantly enhances VLMs' ability to generate descriptive captions with richer visual details and fewer hallucinations, compared with greedy decoding and search methods with other visual reward signals. Furthermore, we find that self-training the model with the VisVM-guided captions improve VLM's performance across a wide range of multimodal benchmarks, indicating the potential for developing self-improving VLMs. Our value model and code are available at https://github.com/si0wang/VisVM.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluations of LVLMs primarily focus on multi-faceted capabilities in natural circumstances, lacking automated and quantifiable assessment for self-driving, let alone the severe road corner cases. In this work, we propose CODA-LM, the very first benchmark for the automatic evaluation of LVLMs for self-driving corner cases. We adopt a hierarchical data structure and prompt powerful LVLMs to analyze complex driving scenes and generate high-quality pre-annotations for the human annotators, while for LVLM evaluation, we show that using the text-only large language models (LLMs) as judges reveals even better alignment with human preferences than the LVLM judges. Moreover, with our CODA-LM, we build CODA-VLM, a new driving LVLM surpassing all open-sourced counterparts on CODA-LM. Our CODA-VLM performs comparably with GPT-4V, even surpassing GPT-4V by +21.42% on the regional perception task. We hope CODA-LM can become the catalyst to promote interpretable self-driving empowered by LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by WACV 2025.

| **[Cross-Self KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04652v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>KV cache pruning has emerged as a promising technique for reducing memory and computation costs in long-context auto-regressive generation. Existing methods for vision-language models (VLMs) typically rely on self-attention scores from large language models (LLMs) to identify and prune irrelevant tokens. However, these approaches overlook the inherent distributional discrepancies between modalities, often leading to inaccurate token importance estimation and the over-pruning of critical visual tokens. To address this, we propose decomposing attention scores into intra-modality attention (within the same modality) and inter-modality attention (across modalities), enabling more precise KV cache pruning by independently managing these distinct attention types. Additionally, we introduce an n-softmax function to counteract distribution shifts caused by pruning, preserving the original smoothness of attention scores and ensuring stable performance. Our final training-free method, \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{S}elf \textbf{P}runing (CSP), achieves competitive performance compared to models with full KV caches while significantly outperforming previous pruning methods. Extensive evaluations on MileBench, a benchmark encompassing 29 multimodal datasets, demonstrate CSP's effectiveness, achieving up to a 41\% performance improvement on challenging tasks like conversational embodied dialogue while reducing the KV cache budget by 13.6\%.

However, we observe that the visual tokens generated by popular vision encoders, such as CLIP and SigLIP, contain significant redundancy. To address this, we introduce VisionZip, a simple yet effective method that selects a set of informative tokens for input to the language model, reducing visual token redundancy and improving efficiency while maintaining model performance. The proposed VisionZip can be widely applied to image and video understanding tasks and is well-suited for multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios, where previous methods tend to underperform. Experimental results show that VisionZip outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by at least 5% performance gains across nearly all settings. Moreover, our method significantly enhances model inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 8x and enabling the LLaVA-Next 13B model to infer faster than the LLaVA-Next 7B model while achieving better results. Furthermore, we analyze the causes of this redundancy and encourage the community to focus on extracting better visual features rather than merely increasing token length.

This is achieved by selecting the object category whose textual representation bears the highest similarity with the query image. While successful in some domains, this method struggles with identifying fine-grained entities as well as generalizing to unseen concepts that are not captured by the training distribution. Recent works attempt to mitigate these challenges by integrating category descriptions at test time, albeit yielding modest improvements. We attribute these limited gains to a fundamental misalignment between image and description representations, which is rooted in the pretraining structure of CLIP. In this paper, we propose GRAIN, a new pretraining strategy aimed at aligning representations at both fine and coarse levels simultaneously. Our approach learns to jointly ground textual descriptions in image regions along with aligning overarching captions with global image representations. To drive this pre-training, we leverage frozen Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to derive large-scale synthetic annotations. We demonstrate the enhanced zero-shot performance of our model compared to current state-of-the art methods across 11 diverse image classification datasets. Additionally, we introduce Products-2023, a newly curated, manually labeled dataset featuring novel concepts, and showcase our model's ability to recognize these concepts by benchmarking on it. Significant improvements achieved by our model on other downstream tasks like retrieval further highlight the superior quality of representations learned by our approach.

Unlike the widely used CLIP-style vision transformer trained by contrastive learning, Florence-2 can capture different levels and aspects of visual features, which are more versatile to be adapted to diverse downstream tasks. We propose a novel feature-fusion architecture and an innovative training recipe that effectively integrates Florence-2's visual features into pretrained LLMs, such as Phi 3.5 and LLama 3. In particular, we propose "depth-breath fusion (DBFusion)" to fuse the visual features extracted from different depths and under multiple prompts. Our model training is composed of end-to-end pretraining of the whole model followed by finetuning of the projection layer and the LLM, on a carefully designed recipe of diverse open-source datasets that include high-quality image captions and instruction-tuning pairs. Our quantitative analysis and visualization of Florence-VL's visual features show its advantages over popular vision encoders on vision-language alignment, where the enriched depth and breath play important roles. Florence-VL achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art MLLMs across various multi-modal and vision-centric benchmarks covering general VQA, perception, hallucination, OCR, Chart, knowledge-intensive understanding, etc. To facilitate future research, our models and the complete training recipe are open-sourced. https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL</p></details> |  |

Traditional 3DVG approaches rely on annotated 3D datasets and predefined object categories, limiting scalability and adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SeeGround, a zero-shot 3DVG framework leveraging 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on large-scale 2D data. We propose to represent 3D scenes as a hybrid of query-aligned rendered images and spatially enriched text descriptions, bridging the gap between 3D data and 2D-VLMs input formats. We propose two modules: the Perspective Adaptation Module, which dynamically selects viewpoints for query-relevant image rendering, and the Fusion Alignment Module, which integrates 2D images with 3D spatial descriptions to enhance object localization. Extensive experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing zero-shot methods by large margins. Notably, we exceed weakly supervised methods and rival some fully supervised ones, outperforming previous SOTA by 7.7% on ScanRefer and 7.1% on Nr3D, showcasing its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 19 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables; Project Page at https://seeground.github.io/</p></details> |

Recently, the research community has begun exploring unified models for visual generation and understanding. However, existing vision tokenizers (e.g., VQGAN) only consider low-level information, which makes it difficult to align with texture semantic features. This results in high training complexity and necessitates a large amount of training data to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, their performance is still far from dedicated understanding models. This paper proposes Semantic Discrete Encoding (SDE), which effectively aligns the information of visual tokens and language tokens by adding semantic constraints to the visual tokenizer. This greatly reduces training difficulty and improves the performance of the unified model. The proposed model significantly surpasses the previous state-of-the-art in various vision-language benchmarks and achieves better performance than dedicated understanding models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask-Adapter: The Devil is in the Masks for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04533v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods adopt mask generators to predict segmentation masks and leverage pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, to classify these masks via mask pooling. Although these approaches show promising results, it is counterintuitive that accurate masks often fail to yield accurate classification results through pooling CLIP image embeddings within the mask regions. In this paper, we reveal the performance limitations of mask pooling and introduce Mask-Adapter, a simple yet effective method to address these challenges in open-vocabulary segmentation. Compared to directly using proposal masks, our proposed Mask-Adapter extracts semantic activation maps from proposal masks, providing richer contextual information and ensuring alignment between masks and CLIP. Additionally, we propose a mask consistency loss that encourages proposal masks with similar IoUs to obtain similar CLIP embeddings to enhance models' robustness to varying predicted masks. Mask-Adapter integrates seamlessly into open-vocabulary segmentation methods based on mask pooling in a plug-and-play manner, delivering more accurate classification results. Extensive experiments across several zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate significant performance gains for the proposed Mask-Adapter on several well-established methods. Notably, Mask-Adapter also extends effectively to SAM and achieves impressive results on several open-vocabulary segmentation datasets.

Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) could enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However, LLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize poorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem properly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a novel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user demonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By incorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only task specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to balance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally. ELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to improve feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results demonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and achieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting its robustness in LfD.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have explored vision-language models (VLMs) as a promising alternative, using multi-view rendering and textual prompting to identify object parts. However, naively applying VLMs in this context introduces several drawbacks, such as the need for meticulous prompt engineering, and fails to leverage the 3D geometric structure of objects. To address these limitations, we propose COPS, a COmprehensive model for Parts Segmentation that blends the semantics extracted from visual concepts and 3D geometry to effectively identify object parts. COPS renders a point cloud from multiple viewpoints, extracts 2D features, projects them back to 3D, and uses a novel geometric-aware feature aggregation procedure to ensure spatial and semantic consistency. Finally, it clusters points into parts and labels them. We demonstrate that COPS is efficient, scalable, and achieves zero-shot state-of-the-art performance across five datasets, covering synthetic and real-world data, texture-less and coloured objects, as well as rigid and non-rigid shapes.

The strongest open-weight models rely heavily on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs to achieve good performance, effectively distilling these closed VLMs into open ones.

To enhance user experience in practical applications, recent studies investigate VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, existing studies mainly focus on single-concept personalization, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits the real-world applicability of personalized VLMs. In this paper, we propose the first multi-concept personalization method named MC-LLaVA along with a high-quality multi-concept personalization dataset. Specifically, MC-LLaVA uses a joint training strategy incorporating multiple concepts in a single training step, allowing VLMs to perform accurately in multi-concept personalization. To reduce the cost of joint training, MC-LLaVA leverages visual token information for concept token initialization, yielding improved concept representation and accelerating joint training. To advance multi-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality dataset. We carefully collect images from various movies that contain multiple characters and manually generate the multi-concept question-answer samples. Our dataset features diverse movie types and question-answer types. We conduct comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate that MC-LLaVA can achieve impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user-specific assistants.

| **[A Stitch in Time Saves Nine: Small VLM is a Precise Guidance for Accelerating Large VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03324v2)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success across various multi-modal tasks, yet large VLMs encounter significant efficiency challenges due to processing numerous visual tokens. A promising approach to accelerating large VLM inference is using partial information, such as attention maps from specific layers, to assess token importance and prune less essential tokens. However, our study reveals three key insights: (i) Partial attention information is insufficient for accurately identifying critical visual tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low token retention ratios; (ii) Global attention information, such as the attention map aggregated across all layers, more effectively preserves essential tokens and maintains comparable performance under aggressive pruning. However, the attention maps from all layers requires a full inference pass, which increases computational load and is therefore impractical in existing methods; and (iii) The global attention map aggregated from a small VLM closely resembles that of a large VLM, suggesting an efficient alternative. Based on these findings, we introduce a \textbf{training-free} method, \underline{\textbf{S}}mall VLM \underline{\textbf{G}}uidance for accelerating \underline{\textbf{L}}arge VLMs (\textbf{SGL}). Specifically, we employ the attention map aggregated from a small VLM to guide visual token pruning in a large VLM. Additionally, an early exiting mechanism is developed to fully use the small VLM's predictions, dynamically invoking the larger VLM only when necessary, yielding a superior trade-off between accuracy and computation. Extensive evaluations across 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of SGL, achieving up to 91\% pruning ratio for visual tokens while retaining competitive performance.</p></details> |  |

However, despite advances in multimodal modeling, there remains a significant lack of specialized datasets that rigorously evaluate a model's capacity to discern subtle color variations and spatial context -- critical elements for situational comprehension and reliable deployment across real-world applications. Toward that goal, we curate MegaCOIN, a high-quality, human-labeled dataset based on \emph{real} images with various contextual attributes. MegaCOIN consists of two parts: MegaCOIN-Instruct, which serves as a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset for VLMs; and MegaCOIN-Bench, an annotated test set that can be used as a stand-alone QA dataset. MegaCOIN~provides three annotated features for 220,000 real images: foreground color, background color, and description of an object's physical environment, constituting 660k human annotations. In addition, MegaCOIN can be applied to benchmark domain generalization (DG) algorithms. We explore benchmarking DG methods in the linear probing setup for VLM and show some new insights. Last but not least, we show that VLMs, including GPT-4o, have subpar color recognition capabilities, and fine-tuning with MegaCOIN can result in improved performance on visual evaluation tasks. In certain cases, MegaCOIN fine-tuned small-scale opensource models such as LLaVA and Bunny can outperform closed-source GPT-4o. We hope the utilities of MegaCOIN can shed light on the directions VLMs can improve and provide a more complex platform for domain generalization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 13 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

These models often deliver suboptimal performance when relying solely on a single image-text contrastive learning objective, spotlighting the need for more effective training mechanisms that guarantee robust cross-modal feature alignment. In this work, we propose CLIP-PING: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training with Proximus Intrinsic Neighbors Guidance, a simple and efficient training paradigm designed to boost the performance of lightweight vision-language models with minimal computational overhead and lower data demands. CLIP-PING bootstraps unimodal features extracted from arbitrary pre-trained encoders to obtain intrinsic guidance of proximus neighbor samples, i.e., nearest-neighbor (NN) and cross nearest-neighbor (XNN). We find that extra contrastive supervision from these neighbors substantially boosts cross-modal alignment, enabling lightweight models to learn more generic features with rich semantic diversity. Extensive experiments reveal that CLIP-PING notably surpasses its peers in zero-shot generalization and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Specifically, a 5.5% gain on zero-shot ImageNet1K with 10.7% (I2T) and 5.7% (T2I) on Flickr30K, compared to the original CLIP when using ViT-XS image encoder trained on 3 million (image, text) pairs. Moreover, CLIP-PING showcases strong transferability under the linear evaluation protocol across several downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 20 tables</p></details> |
| **[LL-ICM: Image Compression for Low-level Machine Vision via Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03841v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Compression for Machines (ICM) aims to compress images for machine vision tasks rather than human viewing. Current works predominantly concentrate on high-level tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the quality of original images is usually not guaranteed in the real world, leading to even worse perceptual quality or downstream task performance after compression. Low-level (LL) machine vision models, like image restoration models, can help improve such quality, and thereby their compression requirements should also be considered. In this paper, we propose a pioneered ICM framework for LL machine vision tasks, namely LL-ICM. By jointly optimizing compression and LL tasks, the proposed LL-ICM not only enriches its encoding ability in generalizing to versatile LL tasks but also optimizes the processing ability of down-stream LL task models, achieving mutual adaptation for image codecs and LL task models. Furthermore, we integrate large-scale vision-language models into the LL-ICM framework to generate more universal and distortion-robust feature embeddings for LL vision tasks. Therefore, one LL-ICM codec can generalize to multiple tasks. We establish a solid benchmark to evaluate LL-ICM, which includes extensive objective experiments by using both full and no-reference image quality assessments. Experimental results show that LL-ICM can achieve 22.65% BD-rate reductions over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[If CLIP Could Talk: Understanding Vision-Language Model Representations Through Their Preferred Concept Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16442v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works often assume that Vision-Language Model (VLM) representations are based on visual attributes like shape. However, it is unclear to what extent VLMs prioritize this information to represent concepts. We propose Extract and Explore (EX2), a novel approach to characterize textual features that are important for VLMs. EX2 uses reinforcement learning to align a large language model with VLM preferences and generates descriptions that incorporate features that are important for the VLM. Then, we inspect the descriptions to identify features that contribute to VLM representations. Using EX2, we find that spurious descriptions have a major role in VLM representations despite providing no helpful information, e.g., Click to enlarge photo of CONCEPT. More importantly, among informative descriptions, VLMs rely significantly on non-visual attributes like habitat (e.g., North America) to represent visual concepts. Also, our analysis reveals that different VLMs prioritize different attributes in their representations. Overall, we show that VLMs do not simply match images to scene descriptions and that non-visual or even spurious descriptions significantly influence their representations.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

However, creating these articulated objects requires extensive human effort and expertise, limiting their broader applications. To overcome this challenge, we present Articulate-Anything, a system that automates the articulation of diverse, complex objects from many input modalities, including text, images, and videos. Articulate-Anything leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate code that can be compiled into an interactable digital twin for use in standard 3D simulators. Our system exploits existing 3D asset datasets via a mesh retrieval mechanism, along with an actor-critic system that iteratively proposes, evaluates, and refines solutions for articulating the objects, self-correcting errors to achieve a robust outcome. Qualitative evaluations demonstrate Articulate-Anything's capability to articulate complex and even ambiguous object affordances by leveraging rich grounded inputs. In extensive quantitative experiments on the standard PartNet-Mobility dataset, Articulate-Anything substantially outperforms prior work, increasing the success rate from 8.7-11.6% to 75% and setting a new bar for state-of-the-art performance. We further showcase the utility of our system by generating 3D assets from in-the-wild video inputs, which are then used to train robotic policies for fine-grained manipulation tasks in simulation that go beyond basic pick and place. These policies are then transferred to a real robotic system.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLAIR: VLM with Fine-grained Language-informed Image Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03561v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP has shown impressive results in aligning images and texts at scale. However, its ability to capture detailed visual features remains limited because CLIP matches images and texts at a global level. To address this issue, we propose FLAIR, Fine-grained Language-informed Image Representations, an approach that utilizes long and detailed image descriptions to learn localized image embeddings. By sampling diverse sub-captions that describe fine-grained details about an image, we train our vision-language model to produce not only global embeddings but also text-specific image representations. Our model introduces text-conditioned attention pooling on top of local image tokens to produce fine-grained image representations that excel at retrieving detailed image content. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on both, existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks, as well as, our newly introduced fine-grained retrieval task which evaluates vision-language models' ability to retrieve partial image content. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FLAIR trained on 30M image-text pairs in capturing fine-grained visual information, including zero-shot semantic segmentation, outperforming models trained on billions of pairs.

| **[Best-of-N Jailbreaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03556v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking, a simple black-box algorithm that jailbreaks frontier AI systems across modalities. BoN Jailbreaking works by repeatedly sampling variations of a prompt with a combination of augmentations - such as random shuffling or capitalization for textual prompts - until a harmful response is elicited. We find that BoN Jailbreaking achieves high attack success rates (ASRs) on closed-source language models, such as 89% on GPT-4o and 78% on Claude 3.5 Sonnet when sampling 10,000 augmented prompts. Further, it is similarly effective at circumventing state-of-the-art open-source defenses like circuit breakers. BoN also seamlessly extends to other modalities: it jailbreaks vision language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and audio language models (ALMs) like Gemini 1.5 Pro, using modality-specific augmentations. BoN reliably improves when we sample more augmented prompts. Across all modalities, ASR, as a function of the number of samples (N), empirically follows power-law-like behavior for many orders of magnitude. BoN Jailbreaking can also be composed with other black-box algorithms for even more effective attacks - combining BoN with an optimized prefix attack achieves up to a 35% increase in ASR. Overall, our work indicates that, despite their capability, language models are sensitive to seemingly innocuous changes to inputs, which attackers can exploit across modalities.</p></details> |  |

We combine the SigLIP-So400m vision encoder that was also used by PaliGemma with the whole range of Gemma 2 models, from the 2B one all the way up to the 27B model. We train these models at three resolutions (224px, 448px, and 896px) in multiple stages to equip them with broad knowledge for transfer via fine-tuning. The resulting family of base models covering different model sizes and resolutions allows us to investigate factors impacting transfer performance (such as learning rate) and to analyze the interplay between the type of task, model size, and resolution. We further increase the number and breadth of transfer tasks beyond the scope of PaliGemma including different OCR-related tasks such as table structure recognition, molecular structure recognition, music score recognition, as well as long fine-grained captioning and radiography report generation, on which PaliGemma 2 obtains state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

We show that a strong vision-language model provides sufficient descriptive power without additional training. The query image is mapped to the text input space using textual inversion. Unlike common practice that invert in the continuous space of text tokens, we use the discrete word space via a nearest-neighbor search in a text vocabulary. With this inversion, the image is softly mapped across the vocabulary and is made more robust using retrieval-based augmentation. Database images are retrieved by a weighted ensemble of text queries combining mapped words with the domain text. Our method outperforms prior art by a large margin on standard and newly introduced benchmarks. Code: https://github.com/NikosEfth/freedom</p></details> | WACV 2025 |

In this paper, we are the first to quantify and evaluate the uncertainty of T2I models with respect to the prompt. Alongside adapting existing approaches designed to measure uncertainty in the image space, we also introduce Prompt-based UNCertainty Estimation for T2I models (PUNC), a novel method leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to better address uncertainties arising from the semantics of the prompt and generated images. PUNC utilizes a LVLM to caption a generated image, and then compares the caption with the original prompt in the more semantically meaningful text space. PUNC also enables the disentanglement of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties via precision and recall, which image-space approaches are unable to do. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PUNC outperforms state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation techniques across various settings. Uncertainty quantification in text-to-image generation models can be used on various applications including bias detection, copyright protection, and OOD detection. We also introduce a comprehensive dataset of text prompts and generation pairs to foster further research in uncertainty quantification for generative models. Our findings illustrate that PUNC not only achieves competitive performance but also enables novel applications in evaluating and improving the trustworthiness of text-to-image models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages and 22 figures</p></details> |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 22.07% in satisfying traversability constraints and 30.53% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Prompt with Distribution-Based Feature Replay for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01598v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new classes based on very limited training data without forgetting the old ones encountered. Existing studies solely relied on pure visual networks, while in this paper we solved FSCIL by leveraging the Vision-Language model (e.g., CLIP) and propose a simple yet effective framework, named Learning Prompt with Distribution-based Feature Replay (LP-DiF). We observe that simply using CLIP for zero-shot evaluation can substantially outperform the most influential methods. Then, prompt tuning technique is involved to further improve its adaptation ability, allowing the model to continually capture specific knowledge from each session. To prevent the learnable prompt from forgetting old knowledge in the new session, we propose a pseudo-feature replay approach. Specifically, we preserve the old knowledge of each class by maintaining a feature-level Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix, which is estimated by the image features of training images and synthesized features generated from a VAE. When progressing to a new session, pseudo-features are sampled from old-class distributions combined with training images of the current session to optimize the prompt, thus enabling the model to learn new knowledge while retaining old knowledge. Experiments on three prevalent benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100, mini-ImageNet, CUB-200, and two more challenging benchmarks, i.e., SUN-397 and CUB-200$^*$ proposed in this paper showcase the superiority of LP-DiF, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in FSCIL.

| **[Progressive Vision-Language Prompt for Multi-Organ Multi-Class Cell Semantic Segmentation with Single Branch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02978v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological cell semantic segmentation is a fundamental technology in computational pathology, essential for applications like cancer diagnosis and effective treatment. Given that multiple cell types exist across various organs, with subtle differences in cell size and shape, multi-organ, multi-class cell segmentation is particularly challenging. Most existing methods employ multi-branch frameworks to enhance feature extraction, but often result in complex architectures. Moreover, reliance on visual information limits performance in multi-class analysis due to intricate textural details. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-OrgaN multi-Class cell semantic segmentation method with a single brancH (MONCH) that leverages vision-language input. Specifically, we design a hierarchical feature extraction mechanism to provide coarse-to-fine-grained features for segmenting cells of various shapes, including high-frequency, convolutional, and topological features. Inspired by the synergy of textual and multi-grained visual features, we introduce a progressive prompt decoder to harmonize multimodal information, integrating features from fine to coarse granularity for better context capture. Extensive experiments on the PanNuke dataset, which has significant class imbalance and subtle cell size and shape variations, demonstrate that MONCH outperforms state-of-the-art cell segmentation methods and vision-language models. Codes and implementations will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Vision-Text Representation Optimizing for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00744v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g. CLIP, have been increasingly used to address the challenging Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) task, benefiting from their well-aligned vision-text embedding space. Typical solutions involve either freezing CLIP during training to unilaterally maintain its zero-shot capability, or fine-tuning CLIP vision encoder to achieve perceptual sensitivity to local regions. However, few of them incorporate vision-text collaborative optimization. Based on this, we propose the Content-Dependent Transfer to adaptively enhance each text embedding by interacting with the input image, which presents a parameter-efficient way to optimize the text representation. Besides, we additionally introduce a Representation Compensation strategy, reviewing the original CLIP-V representation as compensation to maintain the zero-shot capability of CLIP. In this way, the vision and text representation of CLIP are optimized collaboratively, enhancing the alignment of the vision-text feature space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to establish the collaborative vision-text optimizing mechanism within the OVS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior performance on popular OVS benchmarks. In open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches by +0.5, +2.3, +3.4, +0.4 and +1.1 mIoU, respectively on A-847, A-150, PC-459, PC-59 and PAS-20. Furthermore, in a panoptic setting on ADE20K, we achieve the performance of 27.1 PQ, 73.5 SQ, and 32.9 RQ.

However, a major challenge in their real-world application is hallucination, where LVLMs generate non-existent visual elements, eroding user trust. The underlying mechanism driving this multimodal hallucination is poorly understood. Minimal research has illuminated whether contexts such as sky, tree, or grass field involve the LVLM in hallucinating a frisbee. We hypothesize that hidden factors, such as objects, contexts, and semantic foreground-background structures, induce hallucination. This study proposes a novel causal approach: a hallucination probing system to identify these hidden factors. By analyzing the causality between images, text prompts, and network saliency, we systematically explore interventions to block these factors. Our experimental findings show that a straightforward technique based on our analysis can significantly reduce hallucinations. Additionally, our analyses indicate the potential to edit network internals to minimize hallucinated outputs.</p></details> | Accepted by WACV2025 |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts, and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advances in Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction and Quantitative Analysis for Biomedical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02843v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) represents an innovative biomedical imaging modality that harnesses the advantages of optical resolution and acoustic penetration depth while ensuring enhanced safety. Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging Systems: The Bayesian Cramér-Rao Bound Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09557v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution imaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and blood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v3)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GPU-Based Parallel Computing Methods for Medical Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10928v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement in GPU technology, establishing it as a formidable high-performance parallel computing technology with superior floating-point computational capabilities compared to traditional CPUs. This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Fast Prompt Alignment for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08639v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly, yet aligning complex textual prompts with generated visuals remains challenging, especially with intricate object relationships and fine-grained details. This paper introduces Fast Prompt Alignment (FPA), a prompt optimization framework that leverages a one-pass approach, enhancing text-to-image alignment efficiency without the iterative overhead typical of current methods like OPT2I. FPA uses large language models (LLMs) for single-iteration prompt paraphrasing, followed by fine-tuning or in-context learning with optimized prompts to enable real-time inference, reducing computational demands while preserving alignment fidelity. Extensive evaluations on the COCO Captions and PartiPrompts datasets demonstrate that FPA achieves competitive text-image alignment scores at a fraction of the processing time, as validated through both automated metrics (TIFA, VQA) and human evaluation. A human study with expert annotators further reveals a strong correlation between human alignment judgments and automated scores, underscoring the robustness of FPA's improvements. The proposed method showcases a scalable, efficient alternative to iterative prompt optimization, enabling broader applicability in real-time, high-demand settings. The codebase is provided to facilitate further research: https://github.com/tiktok/fast_prompt_alignment</p></details> | <details><summary>TikTo...</summary><p>TikTok Technical Report</p></details> |

Training Humans in Requirement-Driven LLM Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08775v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs for complex tasks (e.g., building a trip advisor chatbot) needs humans to clearly articulate customized requirements (e.g., "start the response with a tl;dr"). However, existing prompt engineering instructions often lack focused training on requirement articulation and instead tend to emphasize increasingly automatable strategies (e.g., tricks like adding role-plays and "think step-by-step"). To address the gap, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a randomized controlled experiment with 30 novices, ROPE significantly outperforms conventional prompt engineering training (20% vs. 1% gains), a gap that automatic prompt optimization cannot close. Furthermore, we demonstrate a direct correlation between the quality of input requirements and LLM outputs. Our work paves the way to empower more end-users to build complex LLM applications.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[BudgetFusion: Perceptually-Guided Adaptive Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05780v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown unprecedented success in the task of text-to-image generation. While these models are capable of generating high-quality and realistic images, the complexity of sequential denoising has raised societal concerns regarding high computational demands and energy consumption. In response, various efforts have been made to improve inference efficiency. However, most of the existing efforts have taken a fixed approach with neural network simplification or text prompt optimization. Are the quality improvements from all denoising computations equally perceivable to humans? We observed that images from different text prompts may require different computational efforts given the desired content. The observation motivates us to present BudgetFusion, a novel model that suggests the most perceptually efficient number of diffusion steps before a diffusion model starts to generate an image. This is achieved by predicting multi-level perceptual metrics relative to diffusion steps. With the popular Stable Diffusion as an example, we conduct both numerical analyses and user studies. Our experiments show that BudgetFusion saves up to five seconds per prompt without compromising perceptual similarity. We hope this work can initiate efforts toward answering a core question: how much do humans perceptually gain from images created by a generative model, per watt of energy?</p></details> |  |
| **[RAP-SR: RestorAtion Prior Enhancement in Diffusion Models for Realistic Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07149v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from their powerful generative capabilities, pretrained diffusion models have garnered significant attention for real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR). Existing diffusion-based SR approaches typically utilize semantic information from degraded images and restoration prompts to activate prior for producing realistic high-resolution images. However, general-purpose pretrained diffusion models, not designed for restoration tasks, often have suboptimal prior, and manually defined prompts may fail to fully exploit the generated potential. To address these limitations, we introduce RAP-SR, a novel restoration prior enhancement approach in pretrained diffusion models for Real-SR. First, we develop the High-Fidelity Aesthetic Image Dataset (HFAID), curated through a Quality-Driven Aesthetic Image Selection Pipeline (QDAISP). Our dataset not only surpasses existing ones in fidelity but also excels in aesthetic quality. Second, we propose the Restoration Priors Enhancement Framework, which includes Restoration Priors Refinement (RPR) and Restoration-Oriented Prompt Optimization (ROPO) modules. RPR refines the restoration prior using the HFAID, while ROPO optimizes the unique restoration identifier, improving the quality of the resulting images. RAP-SR effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose models and the demands of Real-SR by enhancing restoration prior. Leveraging the plug-and-play nature of RAP-SR, our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing diffusion-based SR methods, boosting their performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate its broad applicability and state-of-the-art results. Codes and datasets will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

Specifically, we focus on the issue of integrating expert feedback in the form of labeled example passages into LLM-based pipelines, and compare the two strategies of (1) a dynamic selection of few-shot examples and (2) the automatic optimization of the prompt by the LLM itself. Our findings on a public dataset of 769 climate-related passages from real-world business reports indicate that automatic prompt optimization is the superior approach, while combining both methods provides only limited benefit. Qualitative results indicate that optimized prompts do indeed capture many intricacies of the targeted emission goal extraction task.</p></details> |  |
| **[FIPO: Free-form Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization with Preference Dataset and Modular Fine-tuning Schema](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11811v4)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When the quality of naive prompts is carefully optimized by human experts, the task performance of large language models (LLMs) can be significantly improved. However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

| **[Improving LLM Group Fairness on Tabular Data via In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04642v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective on tabular prediction tasks in the low-data regime, leveraging their internal knowledge and ability to learn from instructions and examples. However, LLMs can fail to generate predictions that satisfy group fairness, that is, produce equitable outcomes across groups. Critically, conventional debiasing approaches for natural language tasks do not directly translate to mitigating group unfairness in tabular settings. In this work, we systematically investigate four empirical approaches to improve group fairness of LLM predictions on tabular datasets, including fair prompt optimization, soft prompt tuning, strategic selection of few-shot examples, and self-refining predictions via chain-of-thought reasoning. Through experiments on four tabular datasets using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, we show the effectiveness of these methods in enhancing demographic parity while maintaining high overall performance. Our analysis provides actionable insights for practitioners in selecting the most suitable approach based on their specific requirements and constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary Pre-Prompt Optimization for Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04291v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have highlighted that large language models (LLMs), when given a small set of task-specific examples, demonstrate remarkable proficiency, a capability that extends to complex reasoning tasks. In particular, the combination of few-shot learning with the chain-of-thought (CoT) approach has been pivotal in steering models towards more logically consistent conclusions. This paper explores the optimization of example selection for designing effective CoT pre-prompts and shows that the choice of the optimization algorithm, typically in favor of comparison-based methods such as evolutionary computation, significantly enhances efficacy and feasibility. Specifically, thanks to a limited exploitative and overfitted optimization, Evolutionary Pre-Prompt Optimization (EPPO) brings an improvement over the naive few-shot approach exceeding 10 absolute points in exact match scores on benchmark datasets such as GSM8k and MathQA. These gains are consistent across various contexts and are further amplified when integrated with self-consistency (SC)</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Prompt Optimizer for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10882v5)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have shown great performance in generating images based on textual prompts. However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wu-zongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network-aided Efficient Large Language Model Services With Denoising-inspired Prompt Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03621v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, leading to their increasing adoption in diverse services delivered through wireless networks. There is a growing trend toward longer prompts to better leverage LLMs' capabilities and address difficult tasks. However, longer prompts not only increase data transmission costs across wireless transmission but also require more computing resources and processing time, impacting the overall system efficiency and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at edge devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Furthermore, inspired by denoising diffusion models, we design a denoising-inspired prompt compression approach that iteratively compresses prompts by gradually removing non-critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services, reducing the total service response time. With our DRL-based JPPO, the framework maintains fidelity comparable to the no-compression baseline while still achieving a 17% service time reduction through adaptive compression. When prioritizing compression, our framework achieves up to 16x compression ratio while maintaining acceptable fidelity (within 30% reduction). Compared to no compression, baseline single-round compression with a 16x compression ratio reduces the system total response time by approximately 42.3%, while the denoising-inspired method achieves a 46.5% service time-saving.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.18010</p></details> |
| **[Revolve: Optimizing AI Systems by Tracking Response Evolution in Textual Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03092v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of LLM-based systems to perform complex tasks through natural language processing and tool interaction. However, optimizing these LLM-based systems for specific tasks remains challenging, often requiring manual interventions like prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Existing automatic optimization methods, such as textual feedback-based techniques (e.g., TextGrad), tend to focus on immediate feedback, analogous to using immediate derivatives in traditional numerical gradient descent. However, relying solely on such feedback can be limited when the adjustments made in response to this feedback are either too small or fluctuate irregularly, potentially slowing down or even stalling the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, more adaptive methods are needed, especially in situations where the system's response is evolving slowly or unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce REVOLVE, an optimization method that tracks how "R"esponses "EVOLVE" across iterations in LLM systems. By focusing on the evolution of responses over time, REVOLVE enables more stable and effective optimization by making thoughtful, progressive adjustments at each step. Experimental results demonstrate that REVOLVE outperforms competitive baselines, achieving a 7.8% improvement in prompt optimization, a 20.72% gain in solution refinement, and a 29.17% increase in code optimization. Additionally, REVOLVE converges in fewer iterations, resulting in significant computational savings. These advantages highlight its adaptability and efficiency, positioning REVOLVE as a valuable tool for optimizing LLM-based systems and accelerating the development of next-generation AI technologies.

| **[Keeping Experts in the Loop: Expert-Guided Optimization for Clinical Data Classification using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02173v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of effectively leveraging their potential in healthcare has taken center stage. A critical barrier to using LLMs for extracting insights from unstructured clinical notes lies in the prompt engineering process. Despite its pivotal role in determining task performance, a clear framework for prompt optimization remains absent. Current methods to address this gap take either a manual prompt refinement approach, where domain experts collaborate with prompt engineers to create an optimal prompt, which is time-intensive and difficult to scale, or through employing automatic prompt optimizing approaches, where the value of the input of domain experts is not fully realized. To address this, we propose StructEase, a novel framework that bridges the gap between automation and the input of human expertise in prompt engineering. A core innovation of the framework is SamplEase, an iterative sampling algorithm that identifies high-value cases where expert feedback drives significant performance improvements. This approach minimizes expert intervention, to effectively enhance classification outcomes. This targeted approach reduces labeling redundancy, mitigates human error, and enhances classification outcomes. We evaluated the performance of StructEase using a dataset of de-identified clinical narratives from the US National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrating significant gains in classification performance compared to current methods. Our findings underscore the value of expert integration in LLM workflows, achieving notable improvements in F1 score while maintaining minimal expert effort. By combining transparency, flexibility, and scalability, StructEase sets the foundation for a framework to integrate expert input into LLM workflows in healthcare and beyond.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/thunderous77/GLaPE.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

Memorization: Tracing Language Models' Capabilities Back to Pretraining Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14985v4)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks or predominantly rely on memorizing vast amounts of pretraining data. To explore this issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional memorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output probabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture task-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language model, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related $n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using the Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate four distinct tasks: machine translation, factual question answering, world knowledge understanding, and math reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with the strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while model performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual question answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine translation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more novel outputs. This study demonstrates that memorization plays a larger role in simpler, knowledge-intensive tasks, while generalization is the key for harder, reasoning-based tasks, providing a scalable method for analyzing large pretraining corpora in greater depth. We also show the practical implications of our analysis through a novel prompt optimization algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated 10-page version</p></details> |

Optimizing the initial noisy latent offers a more efficient alternative to modifying model architectures or prompt engineering for improving semantic alignment. A latest approach, InitNo, refines the initial noisy latent by leveraging attention maps; however, these maps capture only limited information, and the effectiveness of InitNo is highly dependent on the initial starting point, as it tends to converge on a local optimum near this point. To this end, this paper proposes leveraging the language comprehension capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to guide the optimization of the initial noisy latent, and introduces the Noise Diffusion process, which updates the noisy latent to generate semantically faithful images while preserving distribution consistency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the condition under which the update improves semantic faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our framework, consistently enhancing semantic alignment across various diffusion models.

| **[Minority-Focused Text-to-Image Generation via Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07838v2)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the generation of minority samples using pretrained text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models. Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

Within diffusion frameworks, guidance techniques have proven effective in enhancing output quality during inference; however, applying these methods to video diffusion models introduces additional complexity of handling computations across entire sequences. To address this, we propose a novel framework called MotionPrompt that guides the video generation process via optical flow. Specifically, we train a discriminator to distinguish optical flow between random pairs of frames from real videos and generated ones. Given that prompts can influence the entire video, we optimize learnable token embeddings during reverse sampling steps by using gradients from a trained discriminator applied to random frame pairs. This approach allows our method to generate visually coherent video sequences that closely reflect natural motion dynamics, without compromising the fidelity of the generated content. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various models.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://motionprompt.github.io/</p></details> |

By refining and extending user-provided prompts, TIPO bridges the gap between simple inputs and the detailed prompts required for high-quality image generation. Unlike previous approaches that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO adjusts user input prompts with the distribution of a trained prompt dataset, eliminating the need for complex runtime cost via lightweight model. This pre-sampling approach enables efficient and scalable prompt optimization, grounded in the model's training distribution. Experimental results demonstrate TIPO's effectiveness in improving aesthetic scores, reducing image corruption, and better aligning generated images with dataset distributions. These findings highlight the critical role of prompt engineering in T2I systems and open avenues for broader applications of automatic prompt refinement.</p></details> | 26 pages, 19 figures |

However, they often require a larger number of neural function evaluations (NFEs), limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we tackle this problem with Schrodinger Bridges (SBs), which are stochastic differential equations (SDEs) between distributions with minimal transport cost. We analyze the probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) formulation of SBs, and observe that we can decompose its vector field into a linear combination of source predictor, target predictor, and noise predictor. Inspired by this observation, we propose Latent Schrodinger Bridges (LSBs) that approximate the SB ODE via pre-trained Stable Diffusion, and develop appropriate prompt optimization and change of variables formula to match the training and inference between distributions. We demonstrate that our algorithm successfully conduct competitive I2I translation in unsupervised setting with only a fraction of computation cost required by previous DM-based I2I methods.</p></details> |  |

This highlights the need for automated instruction optimization; however, this optimization is particularly challenging when dealing with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients remain inaccessible. We propose ACING, a task-specific prompt optimization approach framed as a stateless continuous-action Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, known as the continuum bandit setting. ACING leverages an actor-critic-based method to optimize prompts, learning from non-differentiable reward signals. We validate ACING by optimizing prompts for ChatGPT on 30 instruction-based tasks. ACING consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving a median score improvement of 10 percentage points. Furthermore, ACING not only recovers but also surpasses human-crafted expert instructions, achieving up to a 39 percentage point improvement against human benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Recent works discovered that the performance of LLMs is heavily dependent on the input prompt. However, prompt engineering is usually done manually in a trial-and-error fashion, which can be labor-intensive and challenging in order to find the optimal prompts. To address these problems and unleash the utmost potential of LLMs, we propose a novel LLMs-agnostic framework for prompt optimization, namely GRL-Prompt, which aims to automatically construct optimal prompts via reinforcement learning (RL) in an end-to-end manner. To provide structured action/state representation for optimizing prompts, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) that better encodes the correlation between the user query and candidate in-context examples. Furthermore, a policy network is formulated to generate the optimal action by selecting a set of in-context examples in a rewardable order to construct the prompt. Additionally, the embedding-based reward shaping is utilized to stabilize the RL training process. The experimental results show that GRL-Prompt outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average increase of 0.10 in ROUGE-1, 0.07 in ROUGE-2, 0.07 in ROUGE-L, and 0.05 in BLEU.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11273v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image priors with 3D representation methods, e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to feed-forward generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. An obstacle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end feed-forward approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the spatial feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts. The code is available in the project page.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Evolutionary Algorithms for Recommender Systems: Benchmarks and Algorithm Comparisons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10697v1)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolutionary computing community, the remarkable language-handling capabilities and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the functionality of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), enabling them to tackle optimization problems involving structured language or program code. Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations.

| **[Generating Energy-efficient code with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10599v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing electricity demands of personal computers, communication networks, and data centers contribute to higher atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn lead to global warming and climate change. Therefore the energy consumption of code must be minimized. Code can be generated by large language models. We look at the influence of prompt modification on the energy consumption of the code generated. We use three different Python code problems of varying difficulty levels. Prompt modification is done by adding the sentence ``Give me an energy-optimized solution for this problem'' or by using two Python coding best practices. The large language models used are CodeLlama-70b, CodeLlama-70b-Instruct, CodeLlama-70b-Python, DeepSeek-Coder-33b-base, and DeepSeek-Coder-33b-instruct. We find a decrease in energy consumption for a specific combination of prompt optimization, LLM, and Python code problem. However, no single optimization prompt consistently decreases energy consumption for the same LLM across the different Python code problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Prompt Formatting Have Any Impact on LLM Performance?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10541v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt optimization is crucial for model performance. Although previous research has explored aspects like rephrasing prompt contexts, using various prompting techniques (like in-context learning and chain-of-thought), and ordering few-shot examples, our understanding of LLM sensitivity to prompt templates remains limited. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of different prompt templates on LLM performance. We formatted the same contexts into various human-readable templates, including plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML, and evaluated their impact across tasks like natural language reasoning, code generation, and translation using OpenAI's GPT models. Experiments show that GPT-3.5-turbo's performance varies by up to 40\% in a code translation task depending on the prompt template, while larger models like GPT-4 are more robust to these variations. Our analysis highlights the need to reconsider the use of fixed prompt templates, as different formats can significantly affect model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Self-alignment seeks to reduce these expenses by enabling models to align themselves. To further lower costs and achieve alignment without any expensive tuning or annotations, we introduce a new tuning-free approach for self-alignment, Dynamic Rewarding with Prompt Optimization (DRPO). Our approach leverages a search-based optimization framework that allows LLMs to iteratively self-improve and craft the optimal alignment instructions, all without additional training or human intervention. The core of DRPO is a dynamic rewarding mechanism, which identifies and rectifies model-specific alignment weaknesses, allowing LLMs to adapt efficiently to diverse alignment challenges. Empirical evaluations on eight recent LLMs, both open- and closed-sourced, demonstrate that DRPO significantly enhances alignment performance, with base models outperforming their SFT/RLHF-tuned counterparts. Moreover, the prompts automatically optimized by DRPO surpass those curated by human experts, further validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings highlight the great potential of current LLMs to achieve adaptive self-alignment through inference-time optimization, complementing tuning-based alignment methods.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Main |
| **[Likelihood as a Performance Gauge for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07773v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work finds that retrieval-augmented generation with large language models is prone to be influenced by the order of retrieved documents in the context. However, the lack of in-depth analysis limits the use of this phenomenon for prompt engineering in practice. In this study, we posit that likelihoods serve as an effective gauge for language model performance. Through experiments on two question-answering datasets with a variety of state-of-the-art language models, we reveal correlations between answer accuracy and the likelihood of the question at both the corpus level and the instance level. In addition, we find that question likelihood can also indicate the position of the task-relevant information in the context. Based on these findings, we propose two methods that use question likelihood as a gauge for selecting and constructing prompts that lead to better performance. We demonstrate their effectiveness with experiments. In addition, our likelihood-based methods are efficient, as they only need to compute the likelihood of the input, requiring much fewer language model passes than heuristic prompt engineering methods that require generating responses. Our analysis deepens our understanding of how input prompts affect model performance and provides a promising direction for efficient prompt optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at NAACL 2025.

Recent works utilize feedbacks generated from erroneous cases to guide the prompt optimization. During inference, they may further retrieve several semantically-related exemplars and concatenate them to the optimized prompts to improve the performance. However, those works only utilize the feedback at the current step, ignoring historical and unseleccted feedbacks which are potentially beneficial. Moreover, the selection of exemplars only considers the general semantic relationship and may not be optimal in terms of task performance and matching with the optimized prompt. In this work, we propose an Exemplar-Guided Reflection with Memory mechanism (ERM) to realize more efficient and accurate prompt optimization. Specifically, we design an exemplar-guided reflection mechanism where the feedback generation is additionally guided by the generated exemplars. We further build two kinds of memory to fully utilize the historical feedback information and support more effective exemplar retrieval. Empirical evaluations show our method surpasses previous state-of-the-arts with less optimization steps, i.e., improving F1 score by 10.1 on LIAR dataset, and reducing half of the optimization steps on ProTeGi.</p></details> |  |
| **[SequentialBreak: Large Language Models Can be Fooled by Embedding Jailbreak Prompts into Sequential Prompt Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06426v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the integration of the Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications increases, so does their susceptibility to misuse, raising significant security concerns. Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to assess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks mainly rely on scenario camouflage, prompt obfuscation, prompt optimization, and prompt iterative optimization to conceal malicious prompts. In particular, sequential prompt chains in a single query can lead LLMs to focus on certain prompts while ignoring others, facilitating context manipulation. This paper introduces SequentialBreak, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits this vulnerability. We discuss several scenarios, not limited to examples like Question Bank, Dialog Completion, and Game Environment, where the harmful prompt is embedded within benign ones that can fool LLMs into generating harmful responses. The distinct narrative structures of these scenarios show that SequentialBreak is flexible enough to adapt to various prompt formats beyond those discussed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SequentialBreak uses only a single query to achieve a substantial gain of attack success rate over existing baselines against both open-source and closed-source models. Through our research, we highlight the urgent need for more robust and resilient safeguards to enhance LLM security and prevent potential misuse.

| **[Robust Prompt Optimization for Defending Language Models Against Jailbreaking Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17263v5)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in AI alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries can modify prompts to induce unwanted behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient and General Prompt Optimization via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v3)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar optimization, EO). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO receiving more research attention recently. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and EO techniques both isolation and combination on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars, consistently improves performance on top of IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with EO strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe a synergy between EO and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing the individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar optimization both as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remain a crucial aspect of APO and deserve greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Expan...</summary><p>Expanded version of the NeurIPS 2024 paper</p></details> |

Recently, Vision-Language~(VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers. Experimental results show that our proposed ChatTracker achieves a performance comparable to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedDTPT: Federated Discrete and Transferable Prompt Tuning for Black-Box Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00985v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP). By fine-tuning LLMs with data from specific scenarios, these foundation models can better adapt to various downstream tasks. However, the fine-tuning process poses privacy leakage risks, particularly in centralized data processing scenarios. To address user privacy concerns, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to mitigate the risks associated with centralized data collection from multiple sources. Nevertheless, the privacy of LLMs themselves is equally critical, as potential malicious attacks challenge their security, an issue that has received limited attention in current research. Consequently, establishing a trusted multi-party model fine-tuning environment is essential. Additionally, the local deployment of large LLMs incurs significant storage costs and high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose for the first time a federated discrete and transferable prompt tuning, namely FedDTPT, for black-box large language models. In the client optimization phase, we adopt a token-level discrete prompt optimization method that leverages a feedback loop based on prediction accuracy to drive gradient-free prompt optimization through the MLM API. For server optimization, we employ an attention mechanism based on semantic similarity to filter all local prompt tokens, along with an embedding distance elbow detection and DBSCAN clustering strategy to enhance the filtering process. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves higher accuracy, reduced communication overhead, and robustness to non-iid data in a black-box setting. Moreover, the optimized prompts are transferable.</p></details> |  |

Building on ProTeGi, MAPO uses positive natural language "gradients" and a momentum-based extension to refine prompts effectively. By tracking gradient history, MAPO avoids local minima and oscillations. It also utilizes beam search and an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for balanced candidate expansion and selection. Benchmark testing shows that MAPO achieves faster convergence time with fewer API calls and higher F1 scores than ProTeGi, proving it as a robust and scalable solution for automated prompt engineering in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace is the Next AutoDiff: Generative Optimization with Rich Feedback, Execution Traces, and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16218v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. AutoDiff frameworks, like PyTorch, enable efficient end-to-end optimization of differentiable systems. However, general computational workflows can be non-differentiable and involve rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). We investigate end-to-end generative optimization -- using generative models such as LLMs within the optimizer for automatic updating of general computational workflows. We discover that workflow execution traces are akin to back-propagated gradients in AutoDiff and can provide key information to interpret feedback for efficient optimization. Formally, we frame a new mathematical setup, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO). In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. We provide a Python library, Trace, that efficiently converts a workflow optimization problem into an OPTO instance using PyTorch-like syntax. Using Trace, we develop a general LLM-based generative optimizer called OptoPrime. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We envision Trace as an open research platform for devising novel generative optimizers and developing the next generation of interactive learning agents.

| **[Fight Back Against Jailbreaking via Prompt Adversarial Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06255v4)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to jailbreaking attacks. Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly focusing on model fine-tuning or heuristical defense designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through prompt optimization remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both grey-box and black-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0%, while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task and incurring only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security.

Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest.

While current methods adopt the paradigm of training a dedicated network end-to-end using labeled image data, they are limited in terms of generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we first present a simple yet well-crafted framework named {\name}, which combines the perception capability of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a modular framework, providing a strong baseline for social relation recognition. Specifically, we instruct VFMs to translate image content into a textual social story, and then utilize LLMs for text-based reasoning. {\name} introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers, as LLMs can generate language-based explanations for the decisions. The manual prompt design process for LLMs at the reasoning phase is tedious and an automated prompt optimization method is desired. As we essentially convert a visual classification task into a generative task of LLMs, automatic prompt optimization encounters a unique long prompt optimization issue. To address this issue, we further propose the Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a greedy search by utilizing gradient information at the segment level. Experimental results show that GSPO significantly improves performance, and our method also generalizes to different image styles.

However, its performance often degrades clearly along the tuning process when the prompts are continuously updated with the test data flow, and the degradation becomes more severe when the domain of test samples changes continuously. We propose HisTPT, a Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning technique that memorizes the useful knowledge of the learnt test samples and enables robust test-time prompt tuning with the memorized knowledge. HisTPT introduces three types of knowledge banks, namely, local knowledge bank, hard-sample knowledge bank, and global knowledge bank, each of which works with different mechanisms for effective knowledge memorization and test-time prompt optimization. In addition, HisTPT features an adaptive knowledge retrieval mechanism that regularizes the prediction of each test sample by adaptively retrieving the memorized knowledge. Extensive experiments show that HisTPT achieves superior prompt tuning performance consistently while handling different visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection) and test samples from continuously changing domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Camera Ready</p></details> |

Past research has focused on optimizing prompts specific to a task. However, much less attention has been given to optimizing the general instructions included in a prompt, known as a system prompt. To address this gap, we propose SPRIG, an edit-based genetic algorithm that iteratively constructs prompts from prespecified components to maximize the model's performance in general scenarios. We evaluate the performance of system prompts on a collection of 47 different types of tasks to ensure generalizability. Our study finds that a single optimized system prompt performs on par with task prompts optimized for each individual task. Moreover, combining system and task-level optimizations leads to further improvement, which showcases their complementary nature. Experiments also reveal that the optimized system prompts generalize effectively across model families, parameter sizes, and languages. This study provides insights into the role of system-level instructions in maximizing LLM potential.</p></details> |  |

However, the recent advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters makes the naive application of traditional FL methods to LLMs impractical due to high computational and communication costs. Furthermore, end users of LLMs often lack access to full architectures and weights of the models, making it impossible for participants to fine-tune these models directly. This paper introduces a novel FL scheme for LLMs, named LanFL, which is purely prompt-based and treats the underlying LLMs as black boxes. We have developed a differentially private synthetic sample generation mechanism to facilitate knowledge sharing among participants, along with a prompt optimization scheme that enables learning from synthetic samples. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LanFL successfully facilitates learning among participants while preserving the privacy of local datasets across various tasks.</p></details> |  |

We utilize recent public collections of user-LLM interactions to construct a natural benchmark called PUPA, which contains personally identifiable information (PII). To study potential approaches, we devise PAPILLON, a multi-stage LLM pipeline that uses prompt optimization to address a simpler version of our task. Our best pipeline maintains high response quality for 85.5% of user queries while restricting privacy leakage to only 7.5%. We still leave a large margin to the generation quality of proprietary LLMs for future work. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/siyan-sylvia-li/PAPILLON.</p></details> |  |

These agent-based systems represent an emerging shift in personal computing. We contribute to the security foundations of agent-based systems and surface a new class of automatically computed obfuscated adversarial prompt attacks that violate the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to an LLM agent. We show how prompt optimization techniques can find such prompts automatically given the weights of a model. We demonstrate that such attacks transfer to production-level agents. For example, we show an information exfiltration attack on Mistral's LeChat agent that analyzes a user's conversation, picks out personally identifiable information, and formats it into a valid markdown command that results in leaking that data to the attacker's server. This attack shows a nearly 80% success rate in an end-to-end evaluation. We conduct a range of experiments to characterize the efficacy of these attacks and find that they reliably work on emerging agent-based systems like Mistral's LeChat, ChatGLM, and Meta's Llama.

Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for thae creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Main Track</p></details> |

However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize the volume of the Pareto reward surface perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce "Survival of the Safest" (SoS), an innovative multi-objective prompt optimization framework that enhances both performance and security in LLMs simultaneously. SoS utilizes an interleaved multi-objective evolution strategy, integrating semantic, feedback, and crossover mutations to effectively traverse the prompt landscape. Differing from the computationally demanding Pareto front methods, SoS provides a scalable solution that expedites optimization in complex, high-dimensional discrete search spaces while keeping computational demands low. Our approach accommodates flexible weighting of objectives and generates a pool of optimized candidates, empowering users to select prompts that optimally meet their specific performance and security needs. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets affirm SoS's efficacy in delivering high performance and notably enhancing safety and security compared to single-objective methods. This advancement marks a significant stride towards the deployment of LLM systems that are both high-performing and secure across varied industrial applications</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |

Unlike black-box predictive models, ABMs excel at explaining the micro-macro linkages that drive such emergent behaviors. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of LLM agents capable of simulating urban activities with unprecedented realism. However, the extreme high computational cost of LLMs presents significant challenges for scaling up the simulations of LLM agents. To address this problem, we propose OpenCity, a scalable simulation platform optimized for both system and prompt efficiencies. Specifically, we propose a LLM request scheduler to reduce communication overhead by parallelizing requests through IO multiplexing. Besides, we deisgn a "group-and-distill" prompt optimization strategy minimizes redundancy by clustering agents with similar static attributes. Through experiments on six global cities, OpenCity achieves a 600-fold acceleration in simulation time per agent, a 70% reduction in LLM requests, and a 50% reduction in token usage. These improvements enable the simulation of 10,000 agents' daily activities in 1 hour on commodity hardware. Besides, the substantial speedup of OpenCity allows us to establish a urban simulation benchmark for LLM agents for the first time, comparing simulated urban activities with real-world data in 6 major cities around the globe. We believe our OpenCity platform provides a critical infrastructure to harness the power of LLMs for interdisciplinary studies in urban space, fostering the collective efforts of broader research communities.

In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning.

In this paper, we introduce StraGo (Strategic-Guided Optimization), a novel approach designed to mitigate prompt drifting by leveraging insights from both successful and failed cases to identify critical factors for achieving optimization objectives. StraGo employs a how-to-do methodology, integrating in-context learning to formulate specific, actionable strategies that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for prompt optimization.

While contemporary frontier LLMs are capable enough to power reasonably good Language agents, the closed-API model makes it hard to improve in cases they perform sub-optimally. To address this, recent works have explored ways to improve their performance using techniques like self-reflection and prompt optimization. Unfortunately, techniques like self-reflection can be used only in an online setup, while contemporary prompt optimization techniques are designed and tested to work on simple tasks. To this end, we introduce MetaReflection, a novel offline reinforcement learning technique that enhances the performance of Language Agents by augmenting a semantic memory based on experiential learnings from past trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of MetaReflection by evaluating across multiple domains, including complex logical reasoning, biomedical semantic similarity, open world question answering, and vulnerability threat detection, in Infrastructure-as-Code, spanning different agent designs. MetaReflection boosts Language agents' performance by 4% to 16.82% over the raw GPT-4 baseline and performs on par with existing state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques while requiring fewer LLM calls.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release our experimental code at: https://aka.ms/metareflection-code</p></details> |

However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4\% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA.</p></details> |  |

Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

These compound systems often lack intermediate labels or gradient flow to optimize each module, making their end-to-end optimization challenging. Here we seek strategies to optimize both the module-level LM weights and the associated prompt templates of such systems to maximize a downstream task metric. We propose for the first time combining the weight and prompt optimization strategies to optimize a modular LM pipeline by alternating between the two to get the same LM to teach itself. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification using mistral-7b, llama-2-7b, and llama-3-8b, these BetterTogether strategies optimizing the weights and prompts of a pipeline together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 60% and 6%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks.

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel algorithm for optimizing LM programs. MIPRO outperforms baseline optimizers on five of seven diverse multi-stage LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 13% accuracy.

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST) that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

Through a feedback-driven critique and synthesis process, PromptWizard achieves an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, iteratively refining both prompt instructions and in-context examples to generate human-readable, task-specific prompts. This guided approach systematically improves prompt quality, resulting in superior performance across 45 tasks.

In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights.

We propose the Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP) framework to address these gaps, enhancing both prompt optimization and adaptation. LCP employs contrastive learning to generate effective prompts by analyzing patterns in good and bad prompt examples. Our evaluation on the Big-Bench Hard dataset shows that LCP has a win rate of over 76% over existing methods in prompt optimization and demonstrates strong adaptability across different model versions, families, and languages.

However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study is a step in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functional code generation, supporting their integration into real-world software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, CCS 2024</p></details> |

Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Automating recovery remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods often rely on human intervention to manually address failures or require exhaustive enumeration of failure cases and the design of specific recovery policies for each scenario, both of which are labor-intensive. Foundational Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which demonstrate remarkable common-sense generalization and reasoning capabilities, have broader, potentially unbounded ODDs. However, limitations in spatial reasoning continue to be a common challenge for many VLMs when applied to robot control and motion-level error recovery. In this paper, we investigate how optimizing visual and text prompts can enhance the spatial reasoning of VLMs, enabling them to function effectively as black-box controllers for both motion-level position correction and task-level recovery from unknown failures. Specifically, the optimizations include identifying key visual elements in visual prompts, highlighting these elements in text prompts for querying, and decomposing the reasoning process for failure detection and control generation. In experiments, prompt optimizations significantly outperform pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models in correcting motion-level position errors and improve accuracy by 65.78% compared to VLMs with unoptimized prompts. Additionally, for task-level failures, optimized prompts enhanced the success rate by 5.8%, 5.8%, and 7.5% in VLMs' abilities to detect failures, analyze issues, and generate recovery plans, respectively, across a wide range of unknown errors in Lego assembly.</p></details> |  |

Fine-grained TSR in the wild is difficult due to the complex road conditions, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR when data is lacking. Our strategy achieves effective fine-grained TSR by stimulating the multiple-thinking capability of large multimodal models (LMM). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for the LMM. The context descriptions with center coordinate prompt optimization help the LMM to locate the target traffic sign in the original road images containing multiple traffic signs and filter irrelevant answers through the proposed prior traffic sign hypothesis. The characteristic description is based on few-shot in-context learning of template traffic signs, which decreases the cross-domain difference and enhances the fine-grained recognition capability of the LMM. The differential descriptions of similar traffic signs optimize the multimodal thinking capability of the LMM. The proposed method is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art TSR results on all five datasets.</p></details> |  |

Effective evaluation necessitates a high degree of human-like diversity within these simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that conversations generated by GPT-4o mini, when used as simulated human participants, systematically differ from those between actual humans across multiple linguistic features. These features include topic variation, lexical attributes, and both the average behavior and diversity (variance) of the language used. To address these discrepancies, we propose an approach that automatically generates prompts for user simulations by incorporating features derived from real human interactions, such as age, gender, emotional tone, and the topics discussed. We assess our approach using differential language analysis combined with deep linguistic inquiry. Our method of prompt optimization, tailored to target specific linguistic features, shows significant improvements. Specifically, it enhances the human-likeness of LLM chatbot conversations, increasing their linguistic diversity. On average, we observe a 54 percent reduction in the error of average features between human and LLM-generated conversations. This method of constructing chatbot sets with human-like diversity holds great potential for enhancing the evaluation process of user-facing bots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Safety Response Boundary of Large Language Models via Unsafe Decoding Path Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10668v3)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are implicit troublemakers. While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |

Existing multimodal fake news detection (MFND) methods can be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are overly dependent on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in QA is often undermined by the vagueness of user questions. To address this issue, we introduce single-round instance-level prompt optimization, referred to as question rewriter. By enhancing the intelligibility of human questions for black-box LLMs, our question rewriter improves the quality of generated answers. The rewriter is optimized using direct preference optimization based on feedback collected from automatic criteria for evaluating generated answers; therefore, its training does not require costly human annotations. The experiments across multiple black-box LLMs and long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. This paper provides a practical framework for training question rewriters and sets a precedent for future explorations in prompt optimization within LFQA tasks.

However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs. In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization (QPO), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM. We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions. Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts. Experiments on various LLM scales and diverse NLP and math tasks demonstrate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of our method in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose FUSE (Flexible Unification of Semantic Embeddings), an inexpensive approach to approximating an adapter layer that maps from one model's textual embedding space to another, even across different tokenizers. We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space. We show the efficacy of our approach via multi-objective optimization over vision-language and causal language models for image captioning and sentiment-based image captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a Conference Paper at COLM 2024; 10 Pages; https://github.com/jnwilliams/FUSE_prompt_inversion.git</p></details> |

As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024)</p></details> |

In this work, we first quantitatively demonstrate that different prompts should be adapted to different LLMs to enhance their capabilities across various downstream tasks in NLP. Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks.

In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |

Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization.

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |

In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |

This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01606v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first gradient-based framework for prompt optimization in text-to-image diffusion models. We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

| **[Autonomous Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11000v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a crucial yet challenging task for optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on customized tasks. This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET), which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts, resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4% increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a significant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
