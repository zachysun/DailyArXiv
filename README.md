| **[Speech Foundation Models Generalize to Time Series Tasks from Wearable Sensor Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00221v2)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.00221v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time- and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show that speech foundation models learn representations that generalize beyond the speech domain and achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse time-series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality-specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find that the convolutional feature encoders of speech models are particularly relevant for wearable sensor applications. The proposed approach enhances performance on data-scarce time-series tasks using simple probing methods. This work takes a step toward developing generalized time-series models that unify speech and sensor modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Synthetic Data Generation for Industrial Bioprocess Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17688v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17688v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scarcity and sparsity in bio-manufacturing poses challenges for accurate model development, process monitoring, and optimization. We aim to replicate and capture the complex dynamics of industrial bioprocesses by proposing the use of a Quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (QWGAN-GP) to generate synthetic time series data for industrially relevant processes. The generator within our GAN is comprised of a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC). This methodology offers potential advantages in process monitoring, modeling, forecasting, and optimization, enabling more efficient bioprocess management by reducing the dependence on scarce experimental data. Our results demonstrate acceptable performance in capturing the temporal dynamics of real bioprocess data. We focus on Optical Density, a key measurement for Dry Biomass estimation. The data generated showed high fidelity to the actual historical experimental data. This intersection of quantum computing and machine learning has opened new frontiers in data analysis and generation, particularly in computationally intensive fields, for use cases such as increasing prediction accuracy for soft sensor design or for use in predictive control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Muscle Anatomy-aware Geometric Deep Learning for sEMG-based Gesture Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17660v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17660v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate decoding of gesture from non-invasive surface electromyography (sEMG) is important for various applications including spatial computing, healthcare, and entertainment, and has been actively pursued by researchers and industry. Majority of sEMG-based gesture decoding algorithms employ deep neural networks that are designed for Euclidean data, and may not be suitable for analyzing multi-dimensional, non-stationary time-series with long-range dependencies such as sEMG. State-of-the-art sEMG-based decoding methods also demonstrate high variability across subjects and sessions, requiring re-calibration and adaptive fine-tuning to boost performance. To address these shortcomings, this work proposes a geometric deep learning model that learns on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds and leverages unsupervised domain adaptation to desensitize the model to subjects and sessions. The model captures the features in time and across sensors with multiple kernels, projects the features onto SPD manifold, learns on manifolds and projects back to Euclidean space for classification. It uses a domain-specific batch normalization layer to address variability between sessions, alleviating the need for re-calibration or fine-tuning. Experiments with publicly available benchmark gesture decoding datasets (Ninapro DB6, Flexwear-HD) demonstrate the superior generalizability of the model compared to Euclidean and other SPD-based models in the inter-session scenario, with up to 8.83 and 4.63 points improvement in accuracy, respectively. Detailed analyses reveal that the model extracts muscle-specific information for different tasks and ablation studies highlight the importance of modules introduced in the work. The proposed method pushes the state-of-the-art in sEMG-based gesture recognition and opens new research avenues for manifold-based learning for muscle signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeEmb: A Lightweight Static-Dynamic Disentanglement Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00461v2)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.00461v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formally Exploring Time-Series Anomaly Detection Evaluation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17562v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17562v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid outages. Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37 widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter requirements.</p></details> | 73 pages, 13 figures |
| **[A Conditional Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Prediction of Battery Capacity Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17414v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17414v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies, and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%, with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[S4ECG: Exploring the impact of long-range interactions for arrhythmia prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17406v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17406v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC, with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998, demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.</p></details> |  |
| **[RINS-T: Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17396v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17396v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues, inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/RINS-T.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> |
| **[Disentanglement Beyond Static vs. Dynamic: A Benchmark and Evaluation Framework for Multi-Factor Sequential Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17313v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17313v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings, primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention. Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Explainable Deep Clustering for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20840v2)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.20840v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings. This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1) combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations; (3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time series analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted at TempXAI Workshop at ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Synthetic Series-Symbol Data Generation for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08445v3)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.08445v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at https://github.com/wwhenxuan/SymTime.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages, 25 figures, 35 tables, NeurIPS 2025 accepted</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking the Power of Mixture-of-Experts for Task-Aware Time Series Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22279v2)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.22279v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP, still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification, we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PatchMoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aurora: Towards Universal Generative Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22295v2)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.22295v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14510v2)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.14510v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the performance of existing patch-based models.

| **[Trading with the Devil: Risk and Return in Foundation Model Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17165v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17165v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models - already transformative in domains such as natural language processing - are now starting to emerge for time-series tasks in finance. While these pretrained architectures promise versatile predictive signals, little is known about how they shape the risk profiles of the trading strategies built atop them, leaving practitioners reluctant to commit serious capital. In this paper, we propose an extension to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that disentangles the systematic risk introduced by a shared foundation model - potentially capable of generating alpha if the underlying model is genuinely predictive - from the idiosyncratic risk attributable to custom fine-tuning, which typically accrues no systematic premium. To enable a practical estimation of these separate risks, we align this decomposition with the concepts of uncertainty disentanglement, casting systematic risk as epistemic uncertainty (rooted in the pretrained model) and idiosyncratic risk as aleatory uncertainty (introduced during custom adaptations). Under the Aleatory Collapse Assumption, we illustrate how Monte Carlo dropout - among other methods in the uncertainty-quantization toolkit - can directly measure the epistemic risk, thereby mapping trading strategies to a more transparent risk-return plane. Our experiments show that isolating these distinct risk factors yields deeper insights into the performance limits of foundation-model-based strategies, their model degradation over time, and potential avenues for targeted refinements. Taken together, our results highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of deploying large pretrained models in competitive financial markets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-Driven Framework for Online Mitigation of False Data Injection Signals in Networked Control Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17155v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17155v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel two-stage framework for online mitigation of False Data Injection (FDI) signals to improve the resiliency of Networked Control Systems (NCSs) and ensure their safe operation in the presence of malicious activities. The first stage involves meta learning to select a base time series forecasting model within a stacked ensemble learning architecture. This is achieved by converting time series data into scalograms using continuous wavelet transform, which are then split into image frames to generate a scalo-temporal representation of the data and to distinguish between different complexity levels of time series data based on an entropy metric using a convolutional neural network. In the second stage, the selected model mitigates false data injection signals in real-time. The proposed framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through rigorous simulations involving the formation control of differential drive mobile robots. By addressing the security challenges in NCSs, this framework offers a promising approach to maintaining system integrity and ensuring operational safety.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fighter: Unveiling the Graph Convolutional Nature of Transformers in Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17106v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17106v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved remarkable success in time series modeling, yet their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This work demystifies the Transformer encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters. Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose \textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales, naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.</p></details> | Preprint |

This paper presents a BlueSky vision built on two complementary directions. One builds robust foundations for time series reasoning, centered on comprehensive temporal understanding, structured multi-step reasoning, and faithful evaluation frameworks. The other advances system-level reasoning, moving beyond language-only explanations by incorporating multi-agent collaboration, multi-modal context, and retrieval-augmented approaches. Together, these directions outline a flexible and extensible framework for advancing time series reasoning, aiming to deliver interpretable and trustworthy temporal intelligence across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting, where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions. The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained domains.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures, accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

Recently, Multivariate Time Series (MTS) analysis has become an important yet challenging task, attracting significant attention. While channel extremely matters to MTS tasks, channel-centric methods are still largely under-explored for MTS. Particularly, no previous work studied the effects of channel information of MTS in order to explore counterfactual effects between these channels and model performance. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Channel-wise Influence (ChInf) method that is the first to estimate the influence of different channels in MTS. Based on ChInf,we naturally derived two channel-wise algorithms by incorporating ChInf into classic MTS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ChInf and ChInf-based methods in critical MTS analysis tasks, such as MTS anomaly detection and MTS data pruning. Specifically, our ChInf-based methods rank top-1 among all methods for comparison, while previous influence functions do not perform well on MTS anomaly detection tasks and MTS data pruning problem. This fully supports the superiority and necessity of ChInf.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator that combines the signature transform from rough path theory with local kernel regression. The signature transform provides a principled way to encode sequential data through iterated integrals, enabling direct comparison of paths in a natural metric space. Our approach leverages signature-induced distances within the classical kernel regression framework, achieving computational efficiency while avoiding the scalability bottlenecks of large-scale kernel matrix operations. We establish finite-sample convergence bounds demonstrating favorable statistical properties of signature-based distances compared to traditional metrics in infinite-dimensional settings. We propose robust signature variants that provide stability against outliers, enhancing practical performance. Applications to both synthetic and real-world data - including stochastic differential equation learning and time series classification - demonstrate competitive accuracy while offering significant computational advantages over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a Resolution-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences. This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new locations with minimal historical context. Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34% lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset. Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.</p></details> |  |

We compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI AI for Social Impact 2026.

Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS, enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The key to building a logically centralized but physically distributed control-plane is running diverse cluster management protocols to achieve consistency through an exchange of control traffic. Meanwhile, we observe that the control traffic exposes unique time-series patterns and directional relationships due to the operational structure even though the traffic is encrypted, and this pattern can disclose confidential information such as control-plane topology and protocol dependencies, which can be exploited for severe attacks. With this insight, we propose a new SD-WAN fingerprinting system, called Heimdallr. It analyzes periodical and operational patterns of SD-WAN cluster management protocols and the context of flow directions from the collected control traffic utilizing a deep learning-based approach, so that it can classify the cluster management protocols automatically from miscellaneous control traffic datasets. Our evaluation, which is performed in a realistic SD-WAN environment consisting of geographically distant three campus networks and one enterprise network shows that Heimdallr can classify SD-WAN control traffic with $\geq$ 93%, identify individual protocols with $\geq$ 80% macro F-1 scores, and finally can infer control-plane topology with $\geq$ 70% similarity.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

However, the accuracy of such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |

Prediction is one of the central issues in this field. Although most related studies have focused on prediction methods, research on the predictability of complex systems has received increasing attention across disciplines--aiming to provide theories and tools to address a key question: What are the limits of prediction accuracy? Predictability itself can serve as an important feature for characterizing complex systems, and accurate estimation of predictability can provide a benchmark for the study of prediction algorithms. This allows researchers to clearly identify the gap between current prediction accuracy and theoretical limits, thereby helping them determine whether there is still significant room to improve existing algorithms. More importantly, investigating predictability often requires the development of new theories and methods, which can further inspire the design of more effective algorithms. Over the past few decades, this field has undergone significant evolution. In particular, the rapid development of data science has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and quantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements, integrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief introduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three core aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network structures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will provide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open challenges for future research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending Prediction-Powered Inference through Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16166v1)** | 2025-10-17 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.16166v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction-powered inference is a recent methodology for the safe use of black-box ML models to impute missing data, strengthening inference of statistical parameters. However, many applications require strong properties besides valid inference, such as privacy, robustness or validity under continuous distribution shifts; deriving prediction-powered methods with such guarantees is generally an arduous process, and has to be done case by case. In this paper, we resolve this issue by connecting prediction-powered inference with conformal prediction: by performing imputation through a calibrated conformal set-predictor, we attain validity while achieving additional guarantees in a natural manner. We instantiate our procedure for the inference of means, Z- and M-estimation, as well as e-values and e-value-based procedures. Furthermore, in the case of e-values, ours is the first general prediction-powered procedure that operates off-line. We demonstrate these advantages by applying our method on private and time-series data. Both tasks are nontrivial within the standard prediction-powered framework but become natural under our method.</p></details> |  |

While recent works have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i) observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational overhead in the online deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting, Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.</p></details> |  |

Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency, particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows, enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data, eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |

Operator theory views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/jw9730/spectral-mean-flow.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |

Yet its potential is underutilized in spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability. Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth surface processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as full paper in ICMLA 2025 (Special Session 1: Deep Learning and Applications)</p></details> |

Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</p></details> |  |

Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored, despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e., over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

We investigate hybrid quantum neural networks for time-series forecasting of photovoltaic power and introduce two architectures. The first, a Hybrid Quantum Long Short-Term Memory model, reduces mean absolute error and mean squared error by more than 40% relative to the strongest baselines evaluated. The second, a Hybrid Quantum Sequence-to-Sequence model, once trained, it predicts power for arbitrary forecast horizons without requiring prior meteorological inputs and achieves a 16% lower mean absolute error than the best baseline on this task. Both hybrid models maintain superior accuracy when training data are limited, indicating improved data efficiency.

Due to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series: concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting, designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received comparatively less attention. Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS, a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

The proposed method encodes temporal dynamics from multiple proprioceptive signals, such as joint positions, IMU readings, and foot velocities, while preserving the robot's morphological structure in the spatial arrangement of the image. This transformation captures inter-signal correlations and gait-dependent patterns, providing a richer feature space than direct time-series processing. We apply this concept in the problem of contact estimation, a key capability for stable and adaptive locomotion on diverse terrains. Experimental evaluations on both real-world datasets and simulated environments show that our image-based representation consistently enhances prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence-based models, underscoring the potential of cross-modal encoding strategies for robotic state learning. Our method achieves superior performance on the contact dataset, improving contact state accuracy from 87.7% to 94.5% over the recently proposed MI-HGNN method, using a 15 times shorter window size.</p></details> |  |

We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than random inspection.

As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both cross-spatial and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</p></details> |  |

In particular, RC trains only the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism - with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

For bedside trust, risk trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new, relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms, and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points. These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned, stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis, particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather, traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51 tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability, robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the importance of training data choice.</p></details> |  |

We formulate the parameter estimation as a Bayesian inverse problem. We consider a parametrized system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which is the FitzHugh--Nagumo model. The considered problem exhibits significant mathematical and computational challenges for classical parameter estimation methods, including strong nonlinearities, nonconvexity, and sharp gradients. We explore how NNs overcome these challenges by approximating reconstruction maps for parameter estimation from observational data. The considered data are time series of the spiking membrane potential of a biological neuron. We infer parameters controlling the dynamics of the model, noise parameters of autocorrelated additive noise, and noise modeled via stochastic differential equations, as well as the covariance matrix of the posterior distribution to expose parameter uncertainties--all with just one forward evaluation of an appropriate NN. We report results for different NN architectures and study the influence of noise on prediction accuracy. We also report timing results for training NNs on dedicated hardware. Our results demonstrate that NNs are a versatile tool to estimate parameters of the dynamical system, stochastic processes, as well as uncertainties, as they propagate through the governing ODE.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 16 figures, 25 tables</p></details> |

Effective portfolio management requires models that can reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based trading strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |

While recent advances in deep learning have enabled time-series forecasting models with accurate predictions, there remains considerable debate over which architectures and design components, such as series decomposition or normalization, are most effective under varying conditions. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate models at a high level, offering limited insight into why certain designs work better. To mitigate this gap, we propose TimeRecipe, a unified benchmarking framework that systematically evaluates time-series forecasting methods at the module level. TimeRecipe conducts over 10,000 experiments to assess the effectiveness of individual components across a diverse range of datasets, forecasting horizons, and task settings. Our results reveal that exhaustive exploration of the design space can yield models that outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and uncover meaningful intuitions linking specific design choices to forecasting scenarios. Furthermore, we release a practical toolkit within TimeRecipe that recommends suitable model architectures based on these empirical insights.

However, existing estimation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks and real data.</p></details> |  |

Advances in snapshot-based system identification approaches have enabled accurately estimating states and topology from a snapshot of measurement data, under random bad data and topology errors. However, modern interactive, targeted false data can stay undetectable to these methods, and significantly compromise estimation accuracy. This work advances system identification that combines snapshot-based method with time-series model via Bayesian Integration, to advance cyber resiliency against both random and targeted false data. Using a distance-based time-series model, this work can leverage historical data of different distributions induced by changes in grid topology and other settings. The normal system behavior captured from historical data is integrated into system identification through a Bayesian treatment, to make solutions robust to targeted false data. We experiment on mixed random anomalies (bad data, topology error) and targeted false data injection attack (FDIA) to demonstrate our method's 1) cyber resilience: achieving over 70% reduction in estimation error under FDIA; 2) anomalous data identification: being able to alarm and locate anomalous data; 3) almost linear scalability: achieving comparable speed with the snapshot-based baseline, both taking <1min per time tick on the large 2,383-bus system using a laptop CPU.</p></details> |  |

In the context of digital currency markets, multifractal properties arise due to the interplay of long-range temporal correlations and heavy-tailed distributions of returns, reflecting intricate market microstructure and trader interactions. Incorporating multifractal analysis into the modeling of cryptocurrency price dynamics enhances the understanding of market inefficiencies, may improve volatility forecasting and facilitate the detection of critical transitions or regime shifts. Based on the multifractal cross-correlation analysis (MFCCA) whose spacial case is the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA), as the most commonly used practical tools for quantifying multifractality, in the present contribution a recently proposed method of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series was applied to the most representative instruments from the digital market. They include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), decentralized exchanges (DEX) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). The results indicate the significant role of heavy tails in generating a broad multifractal spectrum. However, they also clearly demonstrate that the primary source of multifractality are temporal correlations in the series, and without them, multifractality fades out. It appears characteristic that these temporal correlations, to a large extent, do not depend on the thickness of the tails of the fluctuation distribution. These observations, made here in the context of the digital currency market, provide a further strong argument for the validity of the proposed methodology of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series.</p></details> |  |

However, as with Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new, principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data, to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a gate-based QRC for multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively, performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and, interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.</p></details> |  |

This traditional approach tends to prioritize one error indicator, which can bias results when metrics provide contradictory signals. In this context, the Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF) is proposed as a multi-metric framework for hyperparameter optimization that integrates explanatory power (R2), sensitivity to extreme errors (RMSE), and average accuracy (MAE). The performance of HEF was assessed using four widely recognized benchmark datasets in the forecasting domain: the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets. Prediction models were optimized through Grid Search, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Optuna, and statistical analyses based on difference-of-proportions tests confirmed that HEF delivers superior results compared to a unimetric reference function, regardless of the optimizer employed, with particular relevance for heterogeneous monthly time series (M3) and highly granular daily demand scenarios (M5). The findings demonstrate that HEF improves stability, generalization, and robustness at a low computational cost, consolidating its role as a reliable evaluation framework that enhances model selection, enables more accurate demand forecasts, and supports decision-making in dynamic and competitive business environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 25 tables.

However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions.

Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2) We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model. (3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Fidel-TS, a new large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing data from live APIs.

Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

We present a pre-training approach that leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF) data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena (namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.</p></details> |  |

Innovative convolutional attention mechanisms are introduced and applied to multiple recurrent neural networks and bi-dimensional convolutional recurrent neural network layers. Additionally, a novel padding method for convolutional layers is proposed, specifically designed for multivariate time series processing. These innovations are thoroughly detailed, along with their execution process. The proposed architectures follow a standard supervised learning approach, involving model training and subsequent testing on new data, which requires extensive pre-processing and data analysis.

However, due to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE) to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting. Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities, presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.</p></details> |  |

Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model weights will be released under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |

Given that time series data can exhibit different patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies. Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the thirty-ninth annual conference on Neural Information Processing Systems</p></details> |

| **[Enabling Fine-Grained Operating Points for Black-Box LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17727v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17727v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points, preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically, we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.</p></details> | 35 pages |

This study explores students' perceptions of both tools, emphasizing usability, efficiency, and their integration into academic workflows. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed 109 students from diverse disciplines and conducted in-depth interviews with 12 participants. Quantitative analyses, including ANOVA and chi-square tests, were used to assess differences in efficiency, satisfaction, and tool preference. Qualitative insights revealed that students commonly switch between GPT and Google: using Google for credible, multi-source information and GPT for summarization, explanation, and drafting. While neither tool proved sufficient on its own, there was a strong demand for a hybrid solution. In response, we developed a prototype, a chatbot embedded within the search interface, that combines GPT's conversational capabilities with Google's reliability to enhance academic research and reduce cognitive load.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accte...</summary><p>Acctepted at the EMNLP 2025 HCI+NLP Workshop</p></details> |

However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose \textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.}, \textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities.

| **[Evolving LLMs' Self-Refinement Capability via Iterative Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05605v5)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.05605v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Refinement refers to a model's ability to revise its own responses to produce improved outputs. This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.</p></details> |  |

To narrow this gap, this AIED Doctoral Consortium paper presents an ongoing study employing a dialogue analysis approach to identify effective pedagogical strategies from learner-LLM dialogues. The proposed approach involves dialogue data collection, dialogue act (DA) annotation, DA pattern mining, and predictive model building. Early insights are outlined as an initial step toward future research. The work underscores the need to evaluate LLM-based educational applications by focusing on dialogue dynamics and pedagogical strategies.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST (CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference (content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs, narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50%. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing its importance for future NLP research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint (Paper under review)</p></details> |

With the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end, we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors, consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when resolution nears.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://www.prophetarena.co/</p></details> |

Additionally, they typically simulate character memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem, a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character. Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962 dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen, outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in human-likeness and character fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-M...</summary><p>Pre-MIT Press publication version, has been accepted by TACL</p></details> |

However, existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft, a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive applications.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 Poster |
| **[Does Math Reasoning Improve General LLM Capabilities? Understanding Transferability of LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00432v2)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.00432v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intent-Driven LLM Ensemble Planning for Flexible Multi-Robot Disassembly: Demonstration on EV Batteries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17576v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17576v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of planning complex manipulation tasks, in which multiple robots with different end-effectors and capabilities, informed by computer vision, must plan and execute concatenated sequences of actions on a variety of objects that can appear in arbitrary positions and configurations in unstructured scenes. We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates: (i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with 600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components). We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe, executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is funded by the project called "Research and Development of a Highly Automated and Safe Streamlined Process for Increasing Lithium-ion Battery Repurposing and Recycling" (REBELION) under Grant 101104241, and partially supported by the Ministry of National Education, Republic of Turkey.

We introduce DeTAILS, a toolkit that integrates large language model (LLM) assistance into a workflow inspired by Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis framework. DeTAILS supports researchers in generating and refining codes, reviewing clusters, and synthesizing themes through interactive feedback loops designed to preserve analytic agency. We evaluated the system with 18 qualitative researchers analyzing Reddit data. Quantitative results showed strong alignment between LLM-supported outputs and participants' refinements, alongside reduced workload and high perceived usefulness. Qualitatively, participants reported that DeTAILS accelerated analysis, prompted reflexive engagement with AI outputs, and fostered trust through transparency and control. We contribute: (1) an interactive human-LLM workflow for large-scale qualitative analysis, (2) empirical evidence of its feasibility and researcher experience, and (3) design implications for trustworthy AI-assisted qualitative research.</p></details> |  |
| **[How role-play shapes relevance judgment in zero-shot LLM rankers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17535v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17535v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising zero-shot rankers, but their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. In particular, role-play prompts, where the model is assigned a functional role or identity, often give more robust and accurate relevance rankings. However, the mechanisms and diversity of role-play effects remain underexplored, limiting both effective use and interpretability. In this work, we systematically examine how role-play variations influence zero-shot LLM rankers. We employ causal intervention techniques from mechanistic interpretability to trace how role-play information shapes relevance judgments in LLMs. Our analysis reveals that (1) careful formulation of role descriptions have a large effect on the ranking quality of the LLM; (2) role-play signals are predominantly encoded in early layers and communicate with task instructions in middle layers, while receiving limited interaction with query or document representations. Specifically, we identify a group of attention heads that encode information critical for role-conditioned relevance. These findings not only shed light on the inner workings of role-play in LLM ranking but also offer guidance for designing more effective prompts in IR and beyond, pointing toward broader opportunities for leveraging role-play in zero-shot applications.</p></details> |  |

While post-training quantization techniques effectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on static quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads. To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, FlexQuant enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically adjusts bit-widths during each token generation. FlexQuant provides a comprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision requirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained precision management. Evaluations demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible accuracy loss introduced. This framework offers a flexible and adaptive solution for efficient LLM deployment.

Traditional stress management tools often rely on static scripts or passive content, which are ineffective in alleviating stress. NieNie addresses this gap by combining rhythm biofeedback with real-time psychological guidance through a large language model (LLM), offering an interactive, tactile response. The system is specifically designed for young people experiencing emotional stress, collecting physiological signals such as heart rate variability and generating adaptive squeeze-release rhythms via soft, tactile devices. Utilising LLM, the system provides timely squeezing rhythms and psychologically guided feedback prompts, offering personalised rhythm games while reinforcing stress restructuring. Unlike traditional mental health apps, NieNie places users within an embodied interactive loop, leveraging tactile interaction, biofeedback, and adaptive language support to create an immersive stress regulation experience. This study demonstrates how embodied systems can connect bodily actions with mental health in everyday contexts.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1) standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watch the Weights: Unsupervised monitoring and control of fine-tuned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00161v2)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.00161v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution. In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations, thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during fine-tuning with high precision. For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney prompt generation. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/fjzzq2002/WeightWatch.</p></details> |  |

However, how to translate the research on general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems" to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning, and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally, we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.</p></details> |  |

Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual healthcare Q&A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care (MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for healthcare.</p></details> | Under review |

We present a unified framework for certifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a statistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the aggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution with high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration bounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority Certificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when sufficient samples have been drawn. We further prove that label-free post-training methods such as TTRL implicitly sharpen the answer distribution by exponentially tilting it toward its mode, thereby reducing the number of samples required for certification. Building on this insight, we propose new post-training objectives that explicitly optimise this trade-off between sharpness and bias. Together, these results explain and connect two central test-time scaling strategies, self-consistency and TTRL, within a single statistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Provenance graphs model these logs as connected entities and events, revealing relationships that are missed by linear log representations. Existing systems apply anomaly detection to these graphs but often suffer from high false positive rates and coarse-grained alerts. Their reliance on node attributes like file paths or IPs leads to spurious correlations, reducing detection robustness and reliability. To fully understand an attack's progression and impact, security analysts need systems that can generate accurate, human-like narratives of the entire attack. To address these challenges, we introduce OCR-APT, a system for APT detection and reconstruction of human-like attack stories. OCR-APT uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for subgraph anomaly detection, learning behavior patterns around nodes rather than fragile attributes such as file paths or IPs. This approach leads to a more robust anomaly detection. It then iterates over detected subgraphs using Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconstruct multi-stage attack stories. Each stage is validated before proceeding, reducing hallucinations and ensuring an interpretable final report. Our evaluations on the DARPA TC3, OpTC, and NODLINK datasets show that OCR-APT outperforms state-of-the-art systems in both detection accuracy and alert interpretability. Moreover, OCR-APT reconstructs human-like reports that comprehensively capture the attack story.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the authors' extended version of the paper accepted for publication at the ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2025).

They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.</p></details> |  |

However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects, spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better training and prompting strategies.

We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic, numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms, namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4) Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic instruction-following.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |

Reasoning large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1 approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting. Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).</p></details> |  |

However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs, leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss; 2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for lightweight and accurate responses.

The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained, within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.</p></details> |  |

Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks.

Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |

Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS) framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1) context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods, achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has led to a growing demand for AI-enabled wireless networks. The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their innovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training, which make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By integrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic opportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with strong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure enables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence, this survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based LLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques behind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding DeepSeek-style LLM integration.

Building on this, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations, challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions for integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and neural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents.

Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of analytical models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), is highly sensitive to data quality. Our empirical analysis shows that both conventional and LLM-enhanced GNNs degrade notably under textual, structural, and label imperfections, underscoring TAG quality as a key bottleneck for reliable analytics. Existing studies have explored data-level optimization for TAGs, but most focus on specific degradation types and target a single aspect like structure or label, lacking a systematic and comprehensive perspective on data quality improvement. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework for comprehensive TAG quality optimization. LAGA formulates graph quality control as a data-centric process, integrating detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents into an automated loop. It holistically enhances textual, structural, and label aspects through coordinated multi-modal optimization. Extensive experiments on 5 datasets and 16 baselines across 9 scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of LAGA, confirming the importance of data-centric quality optimization for reliable TAG analytics.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7figures |

A Benchmark for Latent Information Discovery in Personalized Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17132v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17132v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information through conversation? We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction, highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for building truly adaptive AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Although there are growing interests in developing various unlearning algorithms, it remains unclear how to best formulate the unlearning problem. The most popular formulation uses a weighted sum of forget and retain loss, but it often leads to performance degradation due to the inherent trade-off between forget and retain losses. In this work, we argue that it is important to model the hierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem (which \textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority over the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical structure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the lower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the upper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new formulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning (\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but more importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and metrics.

While recent approaches often rely on synthetic data generated by LLMs for scalability and cost-efficiency reasons, this reliance can introduce distribution shifts that undermine the nuanced representation of human preferences needed for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment despite such shifts. Our approach first leverages well-learned classifiers to assign a calibration value to each training sample, quantifying its alignment with the target human-preferred distribution. These values are then incorporated into a robust optimization objective that minimizes the worst-case loss over regions of the data space most relevant to human preferences. By explicitly focusing optimization on the target distribution, our approach mitigates the impact of distributional mismatch and improves the generation of responses that better reflect intended values.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available.

Our approach harnesses the capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded, using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding and paragraph grounding settings.

Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings, showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/ZQS1943/SafeSearch</p></details> |

When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay. We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling efficiency with fairness preserved.</p></details> |  |

We are still lacking more challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.</p></details> |  |

Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48\% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released at https://github.com/Skilteee/DiZO.</p></details> |  |

While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual, and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits, including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural correctness.</p></details> |  |

However, standard tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking", "Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors -- additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces. Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to 10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.</p></details> |  |

Examples of target properties $T$ include the binary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the degree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both elicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \emph{observable signal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response containing answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of information leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled guidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this gap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information can be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods come to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between the observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query, we show that achieving error $\varepsilon$ requires at least $\log(1/\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak rate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest increase in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic in terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across system-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the theory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding logits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process trims it to a few dozen. Our results provide the first principled yardstick for balancing transparency and security when deploying LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)</p></details> |

In practical scenarios, competitors can distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly accessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by observation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify imitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the teacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation purely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of actively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access. We introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe) strategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs are accurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for distillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by fine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial loss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation attempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving the performance of the teacher model, student models distilled from the defensively generated outputs demonstrate catastrophically reduced performance, demonstrating DOGe as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/unites-lab/doge</p></details> |

To address verbosity and stakeholder trade-offs, we integrate four mechanisms: (i) plasticity, which applies concise adjustments to candidate solutions; (ii) duplication and maturation, which copy high-performing candidates and specialize them into new modules; (iii) ranked-choice stakeholder aggregation using influence-weighted Borda scoring; and (iv) compute awareness via token-based penalties that reward brevity. The system iteratively proposes diverse strategies, applies plasticity tweaks, simulates stakeholder evaluations, aggregates preferences, selects top candidates, and performs duplication/maturation while factoring compute cost into final scores. In a controlled evaluation over 30 rounds comparing 14 systems, Lark Full achieves a mean rank of 2.55 (95% CI [2.17, 2.93]) and a mean composite score of 29.4/50 (95% CI [26.34, 32.46]), finishing Top-3 in 80% of rounds while remaining cost competitive with leading commercial models ($0.016 per task). Paired Wilcoxon tests confirm that all four mechanisms contribute significantly as ablating duplication/maturation yields the largest deficit ({\Delta}Score = 3.5, Cohen's d_z = 2.53, p < 0.001), followed by plasticity ({\Delta}Score = 3.4, d_z = 1.86), ranked-choice voting ({\Delta}Score = 2.4, d_z = 1.20), and token penalties ({\Delta}Score = 2.2, d_z = 1.63). Rather than a formal Markov Decision Process with constrained optimization, Lark is a practical, compute-aware neuroevolutionary loop that scales stakeholder-aligned strategy generation and makes trade-offs transparent through per-step metrics. Our work presents proof-of-concept findings and invites community feedback as we expand toward real-world validation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Efficient Reasoning</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce $Q\sharp$, a value-based algorithm for KL-regularized RL that guides the reference policy using the optimal regularized $Q$ function. We propose to learn the optimal $Q$ function using distributional RL on an aggregated online dataset. Unlike prior value-based baselines that guide the model using unregularized $Q$-values, our method is theoretically principled and provably learns the optimal policy for the KL-regularized RL problem. Empirically, $Q\sharp$ outperforms prior baselines in math reasoning benchmarks while maintaining a smaller KL divergence to the reference policy. Theoretically, we establish a reduction from KL-regularized RL to no-regret online learning, providing the first bounds for deterministic MDPs under only realizability. Thanks to distributional RL, our bounds are also variance-dependent and converge faster when the reference policy has small variance. In sum, our results highlight $Q\sharp$ as an effective approach for post-training LLMs, offering both improved performance and theoretical guarantees.

Current evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error (RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability. Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained, diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.</p></details> |  |

Our objective is to determine which types of code optimizations and parallel patterns the LLMs can perform by themselves and whether they can be improved by tutoring (providing more detailed hints and guidelines in the prompt). The generated solutions were evaluated both automatically (for correctness and speedup) and manually (code reviews) to provide a more detailed perspective. We also tried an interactive approach where the LLM can fix its previous mistakes within a session.

In this paper we propose a method to perform instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code, guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization without additional training.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

In practice, SFT on a full dataset is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS (Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to full-dataset fine-tuning.

Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages, and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.</p></details> | 8 pages, two columns |

We introduce a two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA. Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently, for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of 22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes and validates a systematic frame- work that translates return forecasts and predictive uncertainty from Large Language Models (LLMs) into the core inputs for the Black-Litterman model: investor views and their confidence lev- els. Through a backtest on S&P 500 constituents, we demonstrate that portfolios driven by top-performing LLMs significantly out- perform traditional baselines in both absolute and risk-adjusted terms. Crucially, our analysis reveals that each LLM exhibits a dis- tinct and consistent investment style which is the primary driver of performance. We found that the selection of an LLM is therefore not a search for a single best forecaster, but a strategic choice of an investment style whose success is contingent on its alignment with the prevailing market regime.

Existing black-box attacks require either access to continuous model outputs like logits or confidence scores (which are rarely available in practice), or rely on proxy signals from other models. Instead, we demonstrate how to prompt LLMs to express their internal confidence in a way that is sufficiently calibrated to enable effective adversarial optimization. We apply our general method to three attack scenarios: adversarial examples for vision-LLMs, jailbreaks and prompt injections. Our attacks successfully generate malicious inputs against systems that only expose textual outputs, thereby dramatically expanding the attack surface for deployed LLMs. We further find that better and larger models exhibit superior calibration when expressing confidence, creating a concerning security paradox where model capability improvements directly enhance vulnerability. Our code is available at this [link](https://github.com/zj-jayzhang/black_box_llm_optimization).</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://awesome-llm-as-a-judge.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[When To Solve, When To Verify: Compute-Optimal Problem Solving and Generative Verification for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01005v2)** | 2025-10-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.01005v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications. Our work provides practical guidance on optimizing test-time scaling by balancing solution generation and verification.

However, systematic analysis of these agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine six repair systems on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting the instances solvable by all or none of these systems, and explore the capabilities of different systems. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and code symbol levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM capability itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Approach to Predict the Impact of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18439v2)** | 2025-10-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.18439v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable. This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task. Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.

Traditional approaches are typically constrained by their reliance on domain-specific expertise to customize planners, and often struggle with spatio-temporal couplings that usually lead to infeasible motions or discrepancies between task planning and motion execution. Despite the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic reasoning, hallucination could result in infeasible motion plans. In this paper, we introduce the T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic motion planning framework that self-corrects it output with formal methods. The framework decomposes spatio-temporal task constraints via three cascaded modules, each of which stimulates an LLM to generate candidate trajectory sequences and examines their feasibility via a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) verifier until one that satisfies complex spatial, temporal, and logical constraints is found.Experiments across different scenarios show that T3 Planner significantly outperforms the baselines. The required reasoning can be distilled into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model that enables efficient deployment.

While this approach improves performance across diverse tasks, its internal mechanism remains poorly understood. We analyze intrinsic self-correction from a representation-level perspective. We formalize and introduce the notion of a prompt-induced shift, which is the change in hidden representations caused by a self-correction prompt. Across 5 open-source LLMs, prompt-induced shifts in text detoxification and text toxification align with latent directions constructed from contrastive pairs. In detoxification, the shifts align with the non-toxic direction; in toxification, they align with the toxic direction. These results suggest that intrinsic self-correction functions as representation steering along interpretable latent directions, beyond what standard metrics such as task scores or model confidence capture. Our analysis offers an interpretability-based account of intrinsic self-correction and contributes to a more systematic understanding of LLM prompting.</p></details> |  |

Existing rule-based or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions, overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation crisis, we introduce AgentAuditor, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert evaluators. AgentAuditor constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed ASSEBench, the first benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety risks and security threats. ASSEBench comprises 2293 meticulously annotated interaction records, covering 15 risk types across 29 application scenarios. A key feature of ASSEBench is its nuanced approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing "Strict" and "Lenient" judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that AgentAuditor not only consistently improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy.

This requires data owners to upload potentially sensitive data to external servers, raising serious privacy concerns. An alternative approach is to fine-tune LLMs directly on edge devices using local data; however, this introduces a new challenge: the model owner must transfer proprietary models to the edge, which risks intellectual property (IP) leakage. To address this dilemma, we propose DistilLock, a TEE-assisted fine-tuning framework that enables privacy-preserving knowledge distillation on the edge. In DistilLock, a proprietary foundation model is executed within a trusted execution environment (TEE) enclave on the data owner's device, acting as a secure black-box teacher. This setup preserves both data privacy and model IP by preventing direct access to model internals. Furthermore, DistilLock employs a model obfuscation mechanism to offload obfuscated weights to untrusted accelerators for efficient knowledge distillation without compromising security. We demonstrate that DistilLock prevents unauthorized knowledge distillation processes and model-stealing attacks while maintaining high computational efficiency, but offering a secure and practical solution for edge-based LLM personalization.</p></details> |  |

Each poem's whitespace distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different text processing methods can result in significantly different representations of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble pretraining datasets for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising 17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511), with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes (r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for reliable decision support.</p></details> |  |

Static, rule-based systems designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2) adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility, achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This inefficiency stems from the fact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more rollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers. Furthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's exploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of the base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for dynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems, enabling more efficient RL training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive dynamic temperature adjustment strategy to maintain the entropy at a stable level, thereby encouraging sufficient exploration. This enables LLMs to improve response precision while preserving their exploratory ability to uncover potential correct pathways.

Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Among these attacks, finetuning-based ones that compromise LLMs' safety alignment via fine-tuning stand out due to its stable jailbreak performance. In particular, a recent study indicates that fine-tuning with as few as 10 harmful question-answer (QA) pairs can lead to successful jailbreaking across various harmful questions. However, such malicious fine-tuning attacks are readily detectable and hence thwarted by moderation models. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can be jailbroken by fine-tuning with only 10 benign QA pairs; our attack exploits the increased sensitivity of LLMs to fine-tuning data after being overfitted. Specifically, our fine-tuning process starts with overfitting an LLM via fine-tuning with benign QA pairs involving identical refusal answers. Further fine-tuning is then performed with standard benign answers, causing the overfitted LLM to forget the refusal attitude and thus provide compliant answers regardless of the harmfulness of a question. We implement our attack on the ten LLMs and compare it with five existing baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in both attack effectiveness and attack stealth. Our findings expose previously unreported security vulnerabilities in current LLMs and provide a new perspective on understanding how LLMs' security is compromised, even with benign fine-tuning.

This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments. Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated (and then estimated) in a principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's predictive distributions and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its construction and updating procedure. We find that BED-LLM achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on the 20 questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences, compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.</p></details> |  |

We find that state-of-the-art LLMs, across multiple prompting strategies, systematically solve textbook problems more accurately than their real-life and inverted counterparts. While reasoning models are more capable, they nonetheless show high variance across problem presentations, suggesting they lack a truly robust reasoning mechanism.

This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math. We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that downstream systems can inspect and reuse.</p></details> |  |

However, prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for language model reasoning.</p></details> |  |

With llm now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.</p></details> |  |

While models display impressive accuracy on factual question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work, we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs' trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/WorldHellow/SLAQ/tree/main</p></details> |

While most existing research concentrates on theoretical properties (such as well-posedness, regularity, and continuity) of the solutions, alongside direct AI-driven methods for solving PDEs, the challenge of uncovering symbolic relationships within these equations remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose leveraging large language models (LLMs) to learn such symbolic relationships. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively predict the operators involved in PDE solutions by utilizing the symbolic information in the PDEs both theoretically and numerically. Furthermore, we show that discovering these symbolic relationships can substantially improve both the efficiency and accuracy of symbolic machine learning for finding analytical approximation of PDE solutions, delivering a fully interpretable solution pipeline. This work opens new avenues for understanding the symbolic structure of scientific problems and advancing their solution processes.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed. Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Alan ...</summary><p>Alan Kai Hassen and Andrius Bernatavicius contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v4)** | 2025-10-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.22512v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Surface Similarity: Evaluating LLM-Based Test Refactorings with Structural and Semantic Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06767v2)** | 2025-10-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.06767v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to refactor unit tests, improving readability and structure while preserving behavior. Evaluating such refactorings, however, remains difficult: metrics like CodeBLEU penalize beneficial renamings and edits, while semantic similarities overlook readability and modularity. We propose CTSES, a first step toward human-aligned evaluation of refactored tests. CTSES combines CodeBLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L into a composite score that balances semantics, lexical clarity, and structural alignment. Evaluated on 5,000+ refactorings from Defects4J and SF110 (GPT-4o and Mistral-Large), CTSES reduces false negatives and provides more interpretable signals than individual metrics. Our emerging results illustrate that CTSES offers a proof-of-concept for composite approaches, showing their promise in bridging automated metrics and developer judgments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToMAP: Training Opponent-Aware LLM Persuaders with Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22961v2)** | 2025-10-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.22961v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion, but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably, while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably, ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training, which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more persuasive language agents.

While modern LLMs possess broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities.

While LLMs can uniquely learn from language feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more effective and data-efficient learning agents.</p></details> |  |

Grounded in marketing theory, the framework distinguishes perceptual attributes from actionable features, producing interpretable and managerially actionable insights. We apply the methodology to 20,000 Yelp reviews of Starbucks stores and evaluate eight prompt variants on a random subset of reviews. Model performance is assessed through agreement with human annotations and predictive validity for customer ratings. Results show high consistency between LLMs and human coders and strong predictive validity, confirming the reliability of the approach. Human coders required a median of six minutes per review, whereas the LLM processed each in two seconds, delivering comparable insights at a scale unattainable through manual coding. Managerially, the analysis identifies attributes and features that most strongly influence customer satisfaction and their associated sentiments, enabling firms to pinpoint "joy points," address "pain points," and design targeted interventions. We demonstrate how structured review data can power an actionable marketing dashboard that tracks sentiment over time and across stores, benchmarks performance, and highlights high-leverage features for improvement. Simulations indicate that enhancing sentiment for key service features could yield 1-2% average revenue gains per store.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has focused on using LLMs to improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However, unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2) annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation, producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438 synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models, mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.</p></details> |  |

Thus, apparent success suggests that LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1) developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations. Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy, they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.</p></details> |  |

While persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories (rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters) and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade, rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open-...</summary><p>Open-source code available at https://github.com/flowersteam/llm_persuasion</p></details> |

We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and recognition in practical deployment scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile, we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively. Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chine...</summary><p>Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision (PRCV), Oral</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the theory available for the Gaussian case cannot be extended to the Poisson case, due to the non-Lipschitz gradient of the fidelity function, the Kullback-Leibler functional, or the absence of closed-form solution for the proximal operator of such term, leading to employ iterative solvers for the inner subproblem. In this work we extend the idea of PIDSplit+ algorithm, exploiting the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, to PnP scheme: this allows to provide a closed form solution for the deblurring step, with no need for iterative solvers. The convergence of the method is assured by employing a firmly non expansive denoiser. The proposed method, namely PnPSplit+, is tested on different Poisson image restoration problems, showing remarkable performance even in presence of high noise level and severe blurring conditions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods depend on costly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image noise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose a cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and visual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These cameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter occlusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that reconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For pose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates the system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between simulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the alignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing image alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical model, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach, with Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171 mm, and 0.858 mm, respectively. These results confirm the method's potential for reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present an ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for practical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters, making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining, dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance.

Unlike conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19 degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods.

While Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, in practice, the goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on inverse scattering benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Meta-lenses, composed of planar arrays of nanoscale scatterers, promise dramatic reductions in size and weight compared to conventional refractive optics. However, severe chromatic aberration, pronounced light scattering, narrow spectral bandwidth, and low light efficiency continue to limit their practical adoption. In this work, we present an end-to-end solution for in-the-wild imaging that pairs a metalens several times thinner than conventional optics with a bespoke multi-image restoration framework optimized for practical metalens cameras. Our method centers on a lightweight convolutional network paired with a memory-efficient burst fusion algorithm that adaptively corrects noise, saturation clipping, and lens-induced distortions across rapid sequences of extremely degraded metalens captures. Extensive experiments on diverse, real-world handheld captures demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing burst-mode and single-image restoration techniques.These results point toward a practical route for deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday imaging applications.</p></details> |  |

While recent defenses in image classification have successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient, as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks: super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from unauthorized knowledge distillation.</p></details> |  |

When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts (PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals, enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives. Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and efficiency.

Winners are determined based on a combination of performance metrics, including full-reference measures (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), and non-reference ones (ARNIQA, TOPIQ). By pushing the boundaries of camera-agnostic low-light RAW image denoising trained on synthetic data, the competition promotes the development of robust and practical models aligned with the rapid progress in digital photography.

Available datasets for thermal imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge, this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration pipeline.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.

Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However, challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications.

In particular, state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures |

Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality (HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate, less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement, and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models, the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM), which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space. We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of image restoration and generation.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{InverseBench}, a framework that evaluates diffusion models across five distinct scientific inverse problems. These problems present unique structural challenges that differ from existing benchmarks, arising from critical scientific applications such as optical tomography, medical imaging, black hole imaging, seismology, and fluid dynamics. With \textsc{InverseBench}, we benchmark 14 inverse problem algorithms that use plug-and-play diffusion priors against strong, domain-specific baselines, offering valuable new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms.

A common approach is to formulate the problem in a Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable, estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone. SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Similarity between current LoRA-adapted and cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while effectively controlling memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning. A Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These learned trajectories replace rigid patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The integration of QCLAM and GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while maintaining high computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose 'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection. RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle, guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core, WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module} (LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation, enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)} module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to complex weather degradations.</p></details> |  |

We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each component.

Existing all-in-one restoration (AIR) approaches either depend on external text prompts or embed hand-crafted architectural priors (e.g., frequency heuristics); both impose discrete, brittle assumptions that weaken generalization to unseen or mixed degradations. To address this limitation, we propose to reframe AIR as learned latent prior inference, where degradation-aware representations are automatically inferred from the input without explicit task cues. Based on latent priors, we formulate AIR as a structured reasoning paradigm: (1) which features to route (adaptive feature selection), (2) where to restore (spatial localization), and (3) what to restore (degradation semantics). We design a lightweight decoding module that efficiently leverages these latent encoded cues for spatially-adaptive restoration. Extensive experiments across six common degradation tasks, five compound settings, and previously unseen degradations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, achieving an average PSNR improvement of 1.68 dB while being three times more efficient.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent stochastic differential equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its simplicity, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various image restoration tasks. Its general applicability on image-conditioned generation is also demonstrated via qualitative results on image-to-image translation.

Our goal is to reconstruct high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR) domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain consistent across spectral bands.

This is partly due to the lack of controlled, ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges, such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes, using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance. Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks, including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of our system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures, submitted to IEEE Journal of Ocean Engineering</p></details> |

We propose \textbf{R-Splatting}, a unified framework that bridges underwater image restoration (UIR) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve both rendering quality and geometric fidelity. Our method integrates multiple enhanced views produced by diverse UIR models into a single reconstruction pipeline. During inference, a lightweight illumination generator samples latent codes to support diverse yet coherent renderings, while a contrastive loss ensures disentangled and stable illumination representations. Furthermore, we propose \textit{Uncertainty-Aware Opacity Optimization (UAOO)}, which models opacity as a stochastic function to regularize training. This suppresses abrupt gradient responses triggered by illumination variation and mitigates overfitting to noisy or view-specific artifacts. Experiments on Seathru-NeRF and our new BlueCoral3D dataset demonstrate that R-Splatting outperforms strong baselines in both rendering quality and geometric accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods for image restoration either rely on data-driven priors that are susceptible to hallucinations, or are limited to static low-density smoke. We introduce SmokeSeer, a method for simultaneous 3D scene reconstruction and smoke removal from a video capturing multiple views of a scene. Our method uses thermal and RGB images, leveraging the fact that the reduced scattering in thermal images enables us to see through the smoke. We build upon 3D Gaussian splatting to fuse information from the two image modalities, and decompose the scene explicitly into smoke and non-smoke components. Unlike prior approaches, SmokeSeer handles a broad range of smoke densities and can adapt to temporally varying smoke. We validate our approach on synthetic data and introduce a real-world multi-view smoke dataset with RGB and thermal images.

Traditional task-specific methods often fail to generalize to unseen or complex degradation types, while recent prompt-learning approaches depend heavily on the degradation estimation capabilities of vision-language models, resulting in inconsistent restorations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LCDiff}, a novel framework comprising two key components: \textit{Lumina-Chroma Decomposition Network} (LCDN) and \textit{Lumina-Guided Diffusion Model} (LGDM). LCDN processes degraded images in the YCbCr color space, separately handling degradation-related luminance and degradation-invariant chrominance components. This decomposition effectively mitigates weather-induced degradation while preserving color fidelity. To further enhance restoration quality, LGDM leverages degradation-related luminance information as a guiding condition, eliminating the need for explicit degradation prompts. Additionally, LGDM incorporates a \textit{Dynamic Time Step Loss} to optimize the denoising network, ensuring a balanced recovery of both low- and high-frequency features in the image. Finally, we present DriveWeather, a comprehensive all-weather driving dataset designed to enable robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, setting a new benchmark in AWIR. The dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/fiwy0527/LCDiff.</p></details> |  |

Training such models effectively requires large-scale datasets that capture the diversity and context of gaming environments. However, existing datasets are often limited to specific domains or rely on artificial degradations, which do not accurately capture the unique characteristics of gaming content. Moreover, benchmarks for controllable video generation remain absent. To address these limitations, we introduce $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$, a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-view dataset specifically designed to overcome the shortcomings of current resources. Unlike existing datasets, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides diverse, high-fidelity gaming content rendered with Unreal Engine 5, offering authentic ground-truth LR-HR paired and multi-view frames across 80 scenes in 8 categories. It includes $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_MR}$ for super-resolution (SR), novel view synthesis (NVS), and combined NVS+SR tasks, and $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_{MS}}$, the first multi-style, object-level ground-truth set enabling research on controlled video generation. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art SR and NVS methods to establish performance baselines. While no existing approaches directly handle controlled video generation, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides a benchmark for advancing this area. By releasing the dataset, we aim to facilitate research in AI-powered restoration, compression, and controllable content generation for next-generation cloud gaming and entertainment.</p></details> |  |

To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant to the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called indiSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI, a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing asymmetry) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of indiSplit on $5$ public datasets. We will release all sources under a permissive license.</p></details> | <details><summary>Selec...</summary><p>Selected at NeurIPS'25 (poster)</p></details> |

However, adversarial training requires costly retraining, while adversarial purification often suffers from low efficiency. More critically, existing defenses are primarily designed under the perturbation-based adversarial threat model, which is ineffective against recently introduced unrestricted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient defense framework that counters both perturbation-based and unrestricted adversarial attacks. Our approach is motivated by the observation that adversarial examples typically lie near the decision boundary and are highly sensitive to pixel-level perturbations. To address this, we introduce adversarial anti-aliasing, a preprocessing technique that mitigates adversarial noise by reducing the magnitude of pixel-level perturbations. In addition, we propose adversarial super-resolution, which leverages prior knowledge from clean datasets to benignly restore high-quality images from adversarially degraded ones. Unlike image synthesis methods that generate entirely new images, adversarial super-resolution focuses on image restoration, making it more suitable for purification. Importantly, both techniques require no additional training and are computationally efficient since they do not rely on gradient computations. To further improve robustness across diverse datasets, we introduce a contrastive learning-based adversarial deblurring fine-tuning method. By incorporating adversarial priors during fine-tuning on the target dataset, this method enhances purification effectiveness without the need to retrain diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension. Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

RAM++ integrates high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen, extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released at https://github.com/DragonisCV/RAM</p></details> | 18 pages, 22 figures |

However, these datasets often differ significantly in resolution, style, and domain characteristics, leading to substantial domain gaps that hinder the development and fair evaluation of unified models. Furthermore, the lack of a large-scale, real-world all-in-one weather restoration dataset remains a critical bottleneck in advancing this field. To address these limitations, we present a real-world all-in-one adverse weather image restoration benchmark dataset, which contains image pairs captured under various weather conditions, including rain, snow, and haze, as well as diverse outdoor scenes and illumination settings. The resulting dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive experiments by benchmarking a variety of task-specific, task-general, and all-in-one restoration methods on our dataset. Our dataset offers a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical all-in-one image restoration in real-world scenarios.

Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance. The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the representation learning process, enabling better general information preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders. Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20%, reduces NMSE by around 50%, and enhances SSIM by 1%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly 1% in parameters.</p></details> |  |

The structure of the perturbations is investigated depending on the acceptable PSNR values and based on the Fourier power spectrum computations for the perturbations. It is demonstrated that moderate variation of image brightness ($\sim 10$ pixel units in a restricted region of an image can result in VMAF growth by $\sim 60\%$). Unlike some other methods demonstrating similar VMAF growth, the subjective quality of an image remains almost unchanged. It is also shown that the adversarial perturbations may demonstrate approximately linear dependence of perturbation amplitudes on the image brightness. The perturbations are studied based on the direct VMAF optimization in PyTorch. The significant discrepancies between the metric values and subjective judgements are also demonstrated when image restoration from noise is carried out using the same direct VMAF optimization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 40 figures |

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a knowledge distillation-driven and diffusion-enhanced (KDD) semantic non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), named KDD-SemNOMA, for multi-user uplink wireless image transmission. Specifically, to ensure robust feature transmission across diverse transmission conditions, we firstly develop a ConvNeXt-based deep joint source and channel coding architecture with enhanced adaptive feature module. This module incorporates signal-to-noise ratio and channel state information to dynamically adapt to additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, to improve image restoration quality without inference overhead, we introduce a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, i.e., a teacher model, trained on interference-free orthogonal transmission, guides a student model via feature affinity distillation and cross-head prediction distillation. Moreover, a diffusion model-based refinement stage leverages generative priors to transform initial SemNOMA outputs into high-fidelity images with enhanced perceptual quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-256 datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions.

We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations. We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity. Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under additional unknown degradations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on common model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling.

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics.

Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

Real-world pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable, stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual staining.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV |

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |

The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play (PnP) methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance as state-of-the-art PnP methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.

While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.</p></details> |  |

However, it faced challenges when it came to distinguishing between shadows and their backgrounds. To address this, we developed Deshadow-Anything, considering the generalization of large-scale datasets, and we performed Fine-tuning on large-scale datasets to achieve image shadow removal. The diffusion model can diffuse along the edges and textures of an image, helping to remove shadows while preserving the details of the image. Furthermore, we design Multi-Self-Attention Guidance (MSAG) and adaptive input perturbation (DDPM-AIP) to accelerate the iterative training speed of diffusion. Experiments on shadow removal tasks demonstrate that these methods can effectively improve image restoration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ne...</summary><p>We need to make major changes and re-upload</p></details> |

Although some methods combining traditional optimization algorithms with DNNs have been proposed, they all have some limitations. In this paper, we propose a three-granularity memory layer and contrast learning named MemoryNet, specifically, dividing the samples into positive, negative, and actual three samples for contrastive learning, where the memory layer is able to preserve the deep features of the image and the contrastive learning converges the learned features to balance. Experiments on Derain/Deshadow/Deblur task demonstrate that these methods are effective in improving restoration performance. In addition, this paper's model obtains significant PSNR, SSIM gain on three datasets with different degradation types, which is a strong proof that the recovered images are perceptually realistic.

The early face restoration methods mainly use statistical priors and degradation models, which are difficult to meet the requirements of real-world applications in practice. In recent years, face restoration has witnessed great progress after stepping into the deep learning era. However, there are few works to systematically study the deep learning based face restoration methods. Thus, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in deep learning techniques for face restoration. Specifically, we first summarize different problem formulations and analyze the characteristics of face images. Second, we discuss the challenges of face restoration. With regard to these challenges, we present a comprehensive review of recent FR methods, including prior-based methods and deep-learning methods. Then, we explore developed techniques in the task of FR covering network architectures, loss functions, and benchmark datasets. We also conduct a systematic benchmark evaluation on representative methods. Finally, we discuss the future directions including network designs, metrics, benchmark datasets, applications, etc. We also provide an open source repository for all the discussed methods, which is available at https://github.com/TaoWangzj/Awesome-Face-Restoration.</p></details> | 35 pages, 14 figures |

However, most existing methods are obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score. Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.</p></details> |  |

Despite great advances in image restoration and enhancement in recent years, such systematic defects often cannot be restored by current state-of-the-art software features as available e.g. in Adobe Photoshop, but would require the incorporation of defect-aware priors into the underlying machine learning techniques. However, there are no publicly available datasets of autochromes with defect annotations. In this paper, we address these limitations and present the first approach that allows the automatic removal of greening color defects in digitized autochrome photographs. For this purpose, we introduce an approach for accurately simulating respective defects and use the respectively obtained synthesized data with its ground truth defect annotations to train a generative AI model with a carefully designed loss function that accounts for color imbalances between defected and non-defected areas. As demonstrated in our evaluation, our approach allows for the efficient and effective restoration of the considered defects, thereby overcoming limitations of alternative techniques that struggle with accurately reproducing original colors and may require significant manual effort.</p></details> |  |

We introduce NeuSee, the first computational imaging framework for high-fidelity sensor protection across the full visible spectrum. It jointly learns a neural representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. NeuSee system is adversarially trained end-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high as $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\textrm{sat}}$, the point at which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system leverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing, integrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for realistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account open-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and positions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions, and sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum imaging and laser suppression for the first time, with a 10.1\% improvement in restored image quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICCVW 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready, update Fig.4</p></details> |

However, license plate areas in dash cam images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework, MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR (RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments, MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms significantly contribute to these improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU), 2025</p></details> |

This study presents the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs), including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models, particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment. This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Degradation-Agnostic Statistical Facial Feature Transformation for Blind Face Restoration in Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07464v3)** | 2025-08-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.07464v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models, particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Underwater monitoring platforms rely on mainly visual data for marine biodiversity analysis, ecological assessment and autonomous exploration. However, underwater environments present significant challenges due to light scattering, absorption and turbidity, which degrade image clarity and distort colour information, which makes accurate observation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose DEEP-SEA, a novel deep learning-based underwater image restoration model to enhance both low- and high-frequency information while preserving spatial structures. The proposed Dual-Frequency Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial and Frequency Modulator aims to adaptively refine feature representations in frequency domains and simultaneously spatial information for better structural preservation. Our comprehensive experiments on EUVP and LSUI datasets demonstrate the superiority over the state of the art in restoring fine-grained image detail and structural consistency. By effectively mitigating underwater visual degradation, DEEP-SEA has the potential to improve the reliability of underwater monitoring platforms for more accurate ecological observation, species identification and autonomous navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, current explainable IQA methods not only inadequately use the same distortion criteria to evaluate both User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images, but also lack detailed quality analysis for monitoring image quality and guiding image restoration. In this study, we establish the first large-scale Visual Distortion Assessment Instruction Tuning Dataset for UGC images, termed ViDA-UGC, which comprises 11K images with fine-grained quality grounding, detailed quality perception, and reasoning quality description data. This dataset is constructed through a distortion-oriented pipeline, which involves human subject annotation and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assessment framework. This framework guides GPT-4o to generate quality descriptions by identifying and analyzing UGC distortions, which helps capturing rich low-level visual features that inherently correlate with distortion patterns. Moreover, we carefully select 476 images with corresponding 6,149 question answer pairs from ViDA-UGC and invite a professional team to ensure the accuracy and quality of GPT-generated information. The selected and revised data further contribute to the first UGC distortion assessment benchmark, termed ViDA-UGC-Bench. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ViDA-UGC and CoT framework for consistently enhancing various image quality analysis abilities across multiple base MLLMs on ViDA-UGC-Bench and Q-Bench, even surpassing GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose SNNSIR, a simple yet effective Spiking Neural Network for Stereo Image Restoration, specifically designed under the spike-driven paradigm where neurons transmit information through sparse, event-based binary spikes. In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on operations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are incompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed SNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and hardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of binary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic Block (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual learning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM) module introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication and highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation. Complementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further improves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature interaction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive experiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak removal, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution demonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. These results highlight the potential for real-time, low-power stereo vision applications. The code will be available after the article is accepted.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization, 1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures, leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; https://github.com/cszn/ConverseNet</p></details> |

Current image restoration methods struggle to handle complex degradation while maintaining efficiency. This paper introduces a novel image restoration architecture that combines multi-dimensional dynamic attention and self-attention within a U-Net framework. To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks.

However, a critical limitation of existing RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131 LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |

While State-Space Models like Mamba offer proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent 1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images, hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations, our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new paradigm for infrared image restoration.

While traditional IR methods have made notable progress by targeting individual degradation types, their specialization often comes at the cost of generalization, leaving them ill-equipped to handle the multifaceted distortions encountered in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance the convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we provide the first in-depth and systematic overview of AiOIR, delivering a structured taxonomy that categorizes existing methods by architectural designs, learning paradigms, and their core innovations. We systematically categorize current approaches and assess the challenges these models encounter, outlining research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. To facilitate the evaluation of existing methods, we also consolidate widely-used datasets, evaluation protocols, and implementation practices, and compare and summarize the most advanced open-source models. As the first comprehensive review dedicated to AiOIR, this paper aims to map the conceptual landscape, synthesize prevailing techniques, and ignite further exploration toward more intelligent, unified, and adaptable visual restoration systems.

In particular, recent advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type, resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with only 2.75M parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Sea-Undistort, a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 1200 paired 512x512 through-water scenes rendered in Blender. Each pair comprises a distortion-free and a distorted view, featuring realistic water effects such as sun glint, waves, and scattering over diverse seabeds. Accompanied by per-image metadata such as camera parameters, sun position, and average depth, Sea-Undistort enables supervised training that is otherwise infeasible in real environments. We use Sea-Undistort to benchmark two state-of-the-art image restoration methods alongside an enhanced lightweight diffusion-based framework with an early-fusion sun-glint mask. When applied to real aerial data, the enhanced diffusion model delivers more complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed, especially in deeper areas, reduces bathymetric errors, suppresses glint and scattering, and crisply restores fine seabed details.

However, existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF) scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition, the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205 high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, such as extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component, utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba, which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.</p></details> |  |

This capability has enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters, and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation.

To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model complexity and computational overhead.

However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration; differences between the original and restored images highlight potential abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans, which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities in heterogeneous cohorts.</p></details> |  |

The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method, Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models. Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then, parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Existing enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with minimal computational overhead.

With the emergence of state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels, effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while preserving semantic consistency.

However, existing methods often rely on implicitly learned priors, which may entangle feature representations and hinder performance in complex or unseen scenarios. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as a classical gradient representation, we observe that it has strong discriminative capability across diverse degradations, making it a powerful and interpretable prior for AIR. Based on this insight, we propose HOGformer, a Transformer-based model that integrates learnable HOG features for degradation-aware restoration. The core of HOGformer is a Dynamic HOG-aware Self-Attention (DHOGSA) mechanism, which adaptively models long-range spatial dependencies conditioned on degradation-specific cues encoded by HOG descriptors. To further adapt the heterogeneity of degradations in AIR, we propose a Dynamic Interaction Feed-Forward (DIFF) module that facilitates channel-spatial interactions, enabling robust feature transformation under diverse degradations. Besides, we propose a HOG loss to explicitly enhance structural fidelity and edge sharpness. Extensive experiments on a variety of benchmarks, including adverse weather and natural degradations, demonstrate that HOGformer achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes well to complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/HOGformer.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging a theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures, highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways, Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual IHC synthesis.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba architecture that maintains information consistency during feature transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight.

However, recent AiO solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions. We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV25 |

While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis.

Recent works address this issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource constraints.

Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.</p></details> |  |

However, most convergence guarantees rely on restrictive regularity assumptions on the target distribution -- such as strong log-concavity or bounded support. This work establishes non-asymptotic convergence bounds in the 2-Wasserstein distance for a general class of probability flow ODEs under considerably weaker assumptions: weak log-concavity and Lipschitz continuity of the score function. Our framework accommodates non-log-concave distributions, such as Gaussian mixtures, and explicitly accounts for initialization errors, score approximation errors, and effects of discretization via an exponential integrator scheme. Bridging a key theoretical challenge in diffusion-based generative modeling, our results extend convergence theory to more realistic data distributions and practical ODE solvers. We provide concrete guarantees for the efficiency and correctness of the sampling algorithm, complementing the empirical success of diffusion models with rigorous theory. Moreover, from a practical perspective, our explicit rates might be helpful in choosing hyperparameters, such as the step size in the discretization.</p></details> |  |

As DMs are now widely used in real-world applications, these biases could perpetuate a distorted worldview and hinder opportunities for minority groups. Existing methods on debiasing DMs usually requires model retraining with a human-crafted reference dataset or additional classifiers, which suffer from two major limitations: (1) collecting reference datasets causes expensive annotation cost; (2) the debiasing performance is heavily constrained by the quality of the reference dataset or the additional classifier. To address the above limitations, we propose FairGen, a plug-and-play method that learns attribute latent directions in a self-discovering manner, thus eliminating the reliance on such reference dataset. Specifically, FairGen consists of two parts: a set of attribute adapters and a distribution indicator. Each adapter in the set aims to learn an attribute latent direction, and is optimized via noise composition through a self-discovering process. Then, the distribution indicator is multiplied by the set of adapters to guide the generation process towards the prescribed distribution. Our method enables debiasing multiple attributes in DMs simultaneously, while remaining lightweight and easily integrable with other DMs, eliminating the need for retraining. Extensive experiments on debiasing gender, racial, and their intersectional biases show that our method outperforms previous SOTA by a large margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models as Dataset Distillation Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17421v1)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.17421v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets from large ones. A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets, demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled dataset.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies, and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%, with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented and published at Ethics and Aesthetics of Artificial Intelligence Conference (EA-AI'25)</p></details> |

However, beyond mere detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary OOD detection to a more granular detection.</p></details> | 11 Pages, 6 Figures |

However, despite significant advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach, Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations. On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost -- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency, outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICML 2025</p></details> |

While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and recognition in practical deployment scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP achieves more adaptive prediction sets.</p></details> |  |

We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

We introduce LangTraj, a language-conditioned scene-diffusion model that simulates the joint behavior of all agents in traffic scenarios. By conditioning on natural language inputs, LangTraj provides flexible and intuitive control over interactive behaviors, generating nuanced and realistic scenarios. Unlike prior approaches that depend on domain-specific guidance functions, LangTraj incorporates language conditioning during training, facilitating more intuitive traffic simulation control. We propose a novel closed-loop training strategy for diffusion models, explicitly tailored to enhance stability and realism during closed-loop simulation. To support language-conditioned simulation, we develop Inter-Drive, a large-scale dataset with diverse and interactive labels for training language-conditioned diffusion models. Our dataset is built upon a scalable pipeline for annotating agent-agent interactions and single-agent behaviors, ensuring rich and varied supervision. Validated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, LangTraj demonstrates strong performance in realism, language controllability, and language-conditioned safety-critical simulation, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and scalable autonomous vehicle testing.

While these methods improve visual quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline, we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes (gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity, (3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4) the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.</p></details> |  |

However, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing discretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency and recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec, a two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the denoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by aligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the efficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains the denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing the consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we can smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step with bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces Adaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user preference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps. Extensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively mitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.</p></details> |  |

Their ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$ predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in high-throughput settings.</p></details> |  |

Discrete diffusion language models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space, where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to 14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME, despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid architectures.</p></details> | Under Submission |

However, existing methods struggle with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection (AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in age accuracy and identity consistency.

To address these challenges, we propose KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input. Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE (KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their kinematic properties.</p></details> |  |

The popular classifier-free guidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced variation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction. We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

However, existing approaches typically rely on perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence, this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, conference</p></details> |

Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models are available at https://github.com/jp-guo/OSCAR.</p></details> |  |

However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models, enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding, i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors. Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.</p></details> |  |

While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on \emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space, causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process; \emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach, \textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.</p></details> |  |

From a geometric perspective, each noise schedule corresponds to a unique trajectory in probability space from the data distribution to a Gaussian prior. However, prior diffusion models rely on empirically chosen schedules that may not be optimal. This inefficiency necessitates many intermediate time steps, resulting in high computational costs during both training and sampling. To address this, we derive a family of geodesic noise schedules corresponding to the shortest paths in probability space under the Fisher-Rao metric. Based on these schedules, we propose Geodesic Diffusion Models (GDMs), which significantly improve training and sampling efficiency by minimizing the energy required to transform between probability distributions. This efficiency further enables sampling to start from an intermediate distribution in conditional image generation, achieving state-of-the-art results with as few as 6 steps. We evaluated GDM on two medical image enhancement tasks: CT image denoising and MRI image super-resolution. Experimental results show that GDM achieved state-of-the-art performance while reducing training time by 20- to 30-fold compared to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and 4- to 6-fold compared to Fast-DDPM, and accelerating sampling by 160- to 170-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively. These gains support the use of GDM for efficient model development and real-time clinical applications. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/GDM-VE.</p></details> |  |

This convex-analytic view connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward efficient one-step diffusion generation.</p></details> | work in progress |

Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024) demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion, deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This Work has been submitted to Monthly Weather Review.

Existing language models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces $\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial music generation platforms.

However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely, Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance, highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image generation.

Although numerous Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AIGI) detectors have been proposed, often reporting high accuracy, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains questionable. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIGIBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the robustness and generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors. AIGIBench simulates real-world challenges through four core tasks: multi-source generalization, robustness to image degradation, sensitivity to data augmentation, and impact of test-time pre-processing. It includes 23 diverse fake image subsets that span both advanced and widely adopted image generation techniques, along with real-world samples collected from social media and AI art platforms. Extensive experiments on 11 advanced detectors demonstrate that, despite their high reported accuracy in controlled settings, these detectors suffer significant performance drops on real-world data, limited benefits from common augmentations, and nuanced effects of pre-processing, highlighting the need for more robust detection strategies. By providing a unified and realistic evaluation framework, AIGIBench offers valuable insights to guide future research toward dependable and generalizable AIGI detection.Data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/HorizonTEL/AIGIBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

But learning and transferring photographic style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/</p></details> |  |

Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.</p></details> |  |

Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since adapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision supervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent challenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and the predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's latent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid image reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the detail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while preventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the inherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and self-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU. It not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained texture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jasmine achieves SoTA performance on the KITTI benchmark and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025. 23 pages, with the appendix</p></details> |

However, achieving accurate text alignment in T2V generation remains challenging due to the complex temporal dependencies across frames. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches to enhance text alignment often require differentiable reward functions trained for videos, hindering their scalability and applicability. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Free$^2$Guide}, a novel gradient-free and training-free framework for aligning generated videos with text prompts. Specifically, leveraging principles from path integral control, Free$^2$Guide approximates guidance for diffusion models using non-differentiable reward functions, thereby enabling the integration of powerful black-box Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as reward models. To enable image-trained LVLMs to assess text-to-video alignment, we leverage \textit{stitching} between video frames and use system prompts to capture sequential attributions. Our framework supports the flexible ensembling of multiple reward models to synergistically enhance alignment without significant computational overhead.

The rise of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations, these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies, our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings.

While numerous studies have addressed the issue of unknown objectives, limited research has focused on scenarios where feasibility constraints are not given explicitly. Overlooking these constraints can lead to spurious solutions that are unrealistic in practice. To deal with such unknown constraints, we propose to perform optimization within the data manifold using diffusion models. To constrain the optimization process to the data manifold, we reformulate the original optimization problem as a sampling problem from the product of the Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function and the data distribution learned by the diffusion model. Depending on the differentiability of the objective function, we propose two different sampling methods. For differentiable objectives, we propose a two-stage framework that begins with a guided diffusion process for warm-up, followed by a Langevin dynamics stage for further correction. For non-differentiable objectives, we propose an iterative importance sampling strategy using the diffusion model as the proposal distribution. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset, six real-world black-box optimization datasets, and a multi-objective molecule optimization dataset show that our method achieves better or comparable performance with previous state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |

Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief, data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation. Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting and pass@k.

These methods aim to learn the distribution of preferred samples while distinguishing them from less preferred ones. However, within the existing preference datasets, the original caption often does not clearly favor the preferred image over the alternative, which weakens the supervision signal available during training. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Caption Preference Optimization (DCPO), a data augmentation and optimization framework that reinforces the learning signal by assigning two distinct captions to each preference pair. This encourages the model to better differentiate between preferred and less-preferred outcomes during training. We also construct Pick-Double Caption, a modified version of Pick-a-Pic v2 with separate captions for each image, and propose three different strategies for generating distinct captions: captioning, perturbation, and hybrid methods. Our experiments show that DCPO significantly improves image quality and relevance to prompts, outperforming Stable Diffusion (SD) 2.1, SFT_Chosen, Diffusion-DPO, and MaPO across multiple metrics, including Pickscore, HPSv2.1, GenEval, CLIPscore, and ImageReward, fine-tuned on SD 2.1 as the backbone.</p></details> |  |

These behavior are often highly uncertain and complex. Prior work has leveraged game theory to design robust patrol strategies to handle uncertainty, but existing adversarial behavior models primarily rely on Gaussian processes or linear models, which lack the expressiveness needed to capture intricate behavioral patterns. To address this limitation, we propose a conditional diffusion model for adversary behavior modeling, leveraging its strong distribution-fitting capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models in the green security domain. Integrating diffusion models into game-theoretic optimization, however, presents new challenges, including a constrained mixed strategy space and the need to sample from an unnormalized distribution to estimate utilities. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a mixed strategy of mixed strategies and employ a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for accurate sampling. Theoretically, our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an epsilon equilibrium with high probability using a finite number of iterations and samples. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world poaching datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> | UAI 2025 |

In turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard the public in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

It provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference by optimizing a likelihood lower bound. Across extensive benchmarks on general tasks, math, code, and so on, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability and performs comparably to our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task.

Traditional agent models often rely on rigid behavioral rules and lack semantic understanding of textual content, while emerging large language model (LLM)-based agents incur prohibitive computational costs at scale. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid simulation framework that strategically integrates LLM-driven agents with diffusion model-based agents. The framework employs LLM-based agents to simulate a core subset of users with rich semantic reasoning, while a diffusion model handles the remaining population efficiently. Although the two agent types operate on disjoint user groups, both incorporate key factors including user personalization, social influence, and content awareness, and interact through a coordinated simulation process. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy, validating the effectiveness of its modular design.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we conduct causal tracing to reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics, averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.</p></details> |  |

However, the generation process remains computationally intensive, and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5, while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.</p></details> |  |

We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear, while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$ resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons, Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training. Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.</p></details> | 22 pages |

These approaches unfold an iterative algorithm with a fixed number of iterations, typically alternating between a neural network-based proximal operator for regularization, a data fidelity operation and auxiliary updates with learnable parameters. While the connection to optimization methods dictate that the proximal operator network should be shared across unrolls, this can introduce artifacts or blurring. Heuristically, practitioners have shown that using distinct networks may be beneficial, but this significantly increases the number of learnable parameters, making it challenging to prevent overfitting. To address these shortcomings, by taking inspirations from proximal operators with varying thresholds in approximate message passing (AMP) and the success of time-embedding in diffusion models, we propose a time-embedded algorithm unrolling scheme for inverse problems. Specifically, we introduce a novel perspective on the iteration-dependent proximal operation in vector AMP (VAMP) and the subsequent Onsager correction in the context of algorithm unrolling, framing them as a time-embedded neural network. Similarly, the scalar weights in the data fidelity operation and its associated Onsager correction are cast as time-dependent learnable parameters. Our extensive experiments on the fastMRI dataset, spanning various acceleration rates and datasets, demonstrate that our method effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show that our time-embedding strategy extends to existing algorithm unrolling approaches, enhancing reconstruction quality without increasing the computational complexity significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neura...</summary><p>Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2025</p></details> |

This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages + references, 13 figures. v2: Corrected a conceptual error in Sec. 4</p></details> |

However, VS faces three major challenges: class imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.</p></details> |  |

Although longitudinal imaging constitutes much of clinical MRI, leveraging previous scans is challenging due to the complex relationship between scan sessions, potentially involving substantial anatomical or pathological changes, and the lack of open-access datasets with both longitudinal pairs and raw k-space needed for training deep learning-based reconstruction models. Methods: We propose a diffusion-model-based reconstruction framework that eliminates the need for longitudinally paired training data. During training, we treat all scan timepoints as samples from the same distribution, therefore requiring only standalone images. At inference, our framework integrates a subject's prior scan in magnitude DICOM format, which is readily available in clinical workflows, to guide reconstruction of the follow-up. To support future development, we introduce an open-access clinical dataset containing multi-session pairs including prior DICOMs and follow-up k-space. Results: Our method consistently outperforms both longitudinal and non-longitudinal baseline reconstruction methods across various accelerated Cartesian acquisition strategies. In imaging regions highly similar to the prior scan, we observe up to 10\% higher SSIM and 2 dB higher PSNR, without degradation in dissimilar areas. Compared to longitudinal reconstruction baselines, our method demonstrates robustness to varying degrees of anatomical change and misregistration. Conclusion: We demonstrate that prior scans can be effectively integrated with state-of-the-art diffusion-based reconstruction methods to improve image quality and enable greater scan acceleration, without requiring an extensive longitudinally-paired training dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, these models struggle to achieve high-precision control while maintaining high-quality motion generation. To address these challenges, we propose MaskControl, the first approach to introduce controllability to the generative masked motion model. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, \textit{Logits Regularizer} implicitly perturbs logits at training time to align the distribution of motion tokens with the controlled joint positions, while regularizing the categorical token prediction to ensure high-fidelity generation. Second, \textit{Logit Optimization} explicitly optimizes the predicted logits during inference time, directly reshaping the token distribution that forces the generated motion to accurately align with the controlled joint positions. Moreover, we introduce \textit{Differentiable Expectation Sampling (DES)} to combat the non-differential distribution sampling process encountered by logits regularizer and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MaskControl outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior motion quality (FID decreases by ~77\%) and higher control precision (average error 0.91 vs. 1.08). Additionally, MaskControl enables diverse applications, including any-joint-any-frame control, body-part timeline control, and zero-shot objective control.

Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources. We assess our method using a combination of this novel dataset and an existing dataset from the literature. Project page: https://lvsn.github.io/gaslight/</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1) complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation), and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space, our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without relying on predefined instrument categories.

However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance. This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset, outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios, our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion models and guidance functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

Diffusion models offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control; however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

Naively estimating the numerator and denominator densities separately using, e.g., kernel density estimators, can lead to unstable performance and suffers from the curse of dimensionality as the number of covariates increases. For this reason, several methods have been developed for estimating the density ratio directly based on (a) Bregman divergences or (b) recasting the density ratio as the odds in a probabilistic classification model that predicts whether an observation is sampled from the numerator or denominator distribution. Additionally, the density ratio can be viewed as the Riesz representer of a continuous linear map, making it amenable to estimation via (c) minimization of the so-called Riesz loss, which was developed to learn the Riesz representer in the Riesz regression procedure in causal inference. In this paper we show that all three of these methods can be unified in a common framework, which we call Bregman-Riesz regression. We further show how data augmentation techniques can be used to apply density ratio learning methods to causal problems, where the numerator distribution typically represents an unobserved intervention. We show through simulations how the choice of Bregman divergence and data augmentation strategy can affect the performance of the resulting density ratio learner. A Python package is provided for researchers to apply Bregman-Riesz regression in practice using gradient boosting, neural networks, and kernel methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repli...</summary><p>Replication code is available from https://github.com/CI-NYC/densityratios</p></details> |

Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object detection through object specific transformations at both training and inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic, diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and inference respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 Workshops</p></details> |

BLIP3o-NEXT unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model, we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism. Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.</p></details> |  |

A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes during sampling.

Unlike explicit harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms, can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent, risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.</p></details> |  |

Prior reviews have predominantly focused on deepfake detection and often overlook recent advancements in synthetic image forensics, particularly approaches that incorporate multimodal frameworks, reasoning-based detection, and training-free methodologies. To bridge this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of state-of-the-art techniques for detecting and classifying synthetic images generated by advanced generative AI models. The review systematically examines core detection paradigms, categorizes them into spatial-domain, frequency-domain, fingerprint-based, patch-based, training-free, and multimodal reasoning-based frameworks, and offers concise descriptions of their underlying principles. We further provide detailed comparative analyses of these methods on publicly available datasets to assess their generalizability, robustness, and interpretability. Finally, the survey highlights open challenges and future directions, emphasizing the potential of hybrid frameworks that combine the efficiency of training-free approaches with the semantic reasoning of multimodal models to advance trustworthy and explainable synthetic image forensics.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 4 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |

As future wireless communication evolves towards environment-aware paradigms, the accurate construction of RMs becomes crucial yet highly challenging. Conventional electromagnetic (EM)-based methods, such as full-wave solvers and ray-tracing approaches, exhibit substantial computational overhead and limited adaptability to dynamic scenarios. Although existing neural network (NN) approaches have efficient inferencing speed, they lack sufficient consideration of the underlying physics of EM wave propagation, limiting their effectiveness in accurately modeling critical EM singularities induced by complex multipath environments. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose a novel physics-inspired RM construction method guided explicitly by the Helmholtz equation, which inherently governs EM wave propagation. Specifically, based on the analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs), we theoretically establish a direct correspondence between EM singularities, which correspond to the critical spatial features influencing wireless propagation, and regions defined by negative wave numbers in the Helmholtz equation. We then design an innovative dual diffusion model (DM)-based large artificial intelligence framework comprising one DM dedicated to accurately inferring EM singularities and another DM responsible for reconstructing the complete RM using these singularities along with environmental contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RadioDiff-$k^2$ framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both image-level RM construction and localization tasks, while maintaining inference latency within a few hundred milliseconds.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains - yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific, dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA, which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://orca-rc.github.io/</p></details> |

While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness.

Framed through the unifying perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis of Shashank Gupta defended at the University of Amsterdam on October 13th 2025</p></details> |

Both categories of datasets exhibit inadequacies in furnishing adequate human identities and authentic in-the-wild background scenes, which are crucial for accurately simulating real-world distributions. In this work, we show that synthetic data created by generative models is complementary to CG-rendered data for achieving remarkable generalization performance on diverse real-world scenes. We propose an effective data generation pipeline based on recent diffusion models, termed HumanWild, which can effortlessly generate human images and corresponding 3D mesh annotations. Specifically, we first collect a large-scale human-centric dataset with comprehensive annotations, e.g, text captions, the depth map, and surface normal images. To generate a wide variety of human images with initial labels, we train a customized, multi-condition ControlNet model. The key to this process is using a 3D parametric model, e.g, SMPL-X, to create various condition inputs easily. Our data generation pipeline is both flexible and customizable, making it adaptable to multiple real-world tasks, such as human interaction in complex scenes and humans captured by wide-angle lenses. By relying solely on generative models, we can produce large-scale, in-the-wild human images with high-quality annotations, significantly reducing the need for manual image collection and annotation. The generated dataset encompasses a wide range of viewpoints, environments, and human identities, ensuring its versatility across different scenarios. We hope that our work could pave the way for scaling up 3D human recovery to in-the-wild scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI, project page: https://yongtaoge.github.io/projects/humanwild</p></details> |

Despite its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments on benchmark datasets.

While the popular Forward-Backward representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to prior offline zero-shot RL methods.

Although existing monocular clothed human reconstruction solutions have shown promising results, they often rely on the assumption that the human subject is in an occlusion-free environment. Thus, when encountering in-the-wild occluded images, these algorithms produce multiview inconsistent and fragmented reconstructions. Additionally, most algorithms for monocular 3D human reconstruction leverage geometric priors such as SMPL annotations for training and inference, which are extremely challenging to acquire in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose CHROME: Clothed Human Reconstruction with Occlusion-Resilience and Multiview-ConsistEncy from a Single Image, a novel pipeline designed to reconstruct occlusion-resilient 3D humans with multiview consistency from a single occluded image, without requiring either ground-truth geometric prior annotations or 3D supervision. Specifically, CHROME leverages a multiview diffusion model to first synthesize occlusion-free human images from the occluded input, compatible with off-the-shelf pose control to explicitly enforce cross-view consistency during synthesis. A 3D reconstruction model is then trained to predict a set of 3D Gaussians conditioned on both the occluded input and synthesized views, aligning cross-view details to produce a cohesive and accurate 3D representation. CHROME achieves significant improvements in terms of both novel view synthesis (upto 3 db PSNR) and geometric reconstruction under challenging conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code : https://github.com/sunwoocho/SRDD</p></details> |

Transfer learning (TL), widely successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models. This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL, addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete to continuous time settings. As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains a major challenge to combine these data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution, bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.</p></details> |  |

Extensive experiments on harmful textual queries from established safety benchmarks show that our approach achieves an average attack success rate of 83.5\%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 46\%. Compared with existing visual jailbreak methods, our sequential narrative strategy demonstrates superior effectiveness across diverse categories of harmful content.

Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while spiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their structural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from gas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic light, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN emission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has been discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength observations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO from a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the machine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday objects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we created a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any source pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light distributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We condition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the central few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the diffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that deviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few central pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using VIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN and QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted as part of the A&A Special Issue `Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1)', 34 pages, 26 figures</p></details> |

This is a critical bottleneck, as such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data, our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://nupurkmr9.github.io/npedit/</p></details> |

Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality mocap data to open-world scenarios.

While recent advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder, adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion, thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information. Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |

Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language. Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing, poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

Following Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models have become the mainstream, owing to their robust generative capacities. However, inherent limitations of the diffusion process often lead to inter-frame flicker and slow inference, restricting their practical deployment. To address this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head animations from a single reference image, driven directly by text or audio input. To mitigate flicker and ensure continuity, AvatarSync leverages an autoregressive pipeline that enhances temporal modeling. In addition, to ensure controllability, we introduce phonemes, which are the basic units of speech sounds, and construct a many-to-one mapping from text/audio to phonemes, enabling precise phoneme-to-visual alignment. Additionally, to further accelerate inference, we adopt a two-stage generation strategy that decouples semantic modeling from visual dynamics, and incorporate a customized Phoneme-Frame Causal Attention Mask to support multi-step parallel acceleration. Extensive experiments conducted on both Chinese (CMLR) and English (HDTF) datasets demonstrate that AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a scalable and controllable solution.</p></details> |  |

However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4 bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana, \pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).</p></details> |  |

A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE) and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

This approach effectively captures complex dependencies and multi-modalities within posteriors. ConDiSim is evaluated across ten benchmark problems and two real-world test problems, where it demonstrates effective posterior approximation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and stability in model training. ConDiSim offers a robust and extensible framework for simulation-based inference, particularly suitable for parameter inference workflows requiring fast inference methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent embodied systems often adopt a dual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System 1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the embodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and decision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation of the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution success, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete dimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of cognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as embodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation pipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension, perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure analysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure realism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects, and multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For planning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework, MLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14 MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the development of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in https://robo-bench.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in handling multi-turn video dialogues.

Supervised detection models require domain-specific training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation, and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples), MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65 points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97 points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled data remains scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can translate images to code, they often fail on complex UIs, struggling to unify visual perception, layout planning, and code synthesis within a single monolithic model, which leads to frequent perception and planning errors. To address this, we propose ScreenCoder, a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes the task into three interpretable stages: grounding, planning, and generation. By assigning these distinct responsibilities to specialized agents, our framework achieves significantly higher robustness and fidelity than end-to-end approaches. Furthermore, ScreenCoder serves as a scalable data engine, enabling us to generate high-quality image-code pairs. We use this data to fine-tune open-source MLLM via a dual-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, demonstrating substantial gains in its UI generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness.

However, training of multimodal networks is typically hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance, hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent modalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal learning on improving model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN'25).

While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

In solving this problem, a proactive safety artificial intelligence (AI) system would work better than a reactive one. Instead of just reacting to users' questions, it would actively watch people's behavior and their environment to detect potential dangers in advance. Our Proactive Safety Bench (PaSBench) evaluates this capability through 416 multimodal scenarios (128 image sequences, 288 text logs) spanning 5 safety-critical domains. Evaluation of 36 advanced models reveals fundamental limitations: Top performers like Gemini-2.5-pro achieve 71% image and 64% text accuracy, but miss 45-55% risks in repeated trials. Through failure analysis, we identify unstable proactive reasoning rather than knowledge deficits as the primary limitation. This work establishes (1) a proactive safety benchmark, (2) systematic evidence of model limitations, and (3) critical directions for developing reliable protective AI. We believe our dataset and findings can promote the development of safer AI assistants that actively prevent harm rather than merely respond to requests.

Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use \textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based \textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN} achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection (0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions, and context-dependent hostility.</p></details> |  |

But MLLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreaks, where adversarial inputs can collapse their safety constraints and trigger unethical responses. In this work, we investigate jailbreaks in the text-vision multimodal setting and pioneer the observation that visual alignment imposes uneven safety constraints across modalities in MLLMs, thereby giving rise to multimodal safety asymmetry. We then develop PolyJailbreak, a black-box jailbreak method grounded in reinforcement learning. Initially, we probe the model's attention dynamics and latent representation space, assessing how visual inputs reshape cross-modal information flow and diminish the model's ability to separate harmful from benign inputs, thereby exposing exploitable vulnerabilities. On this basis, we systematize them into generalizable and reusable operational rules that constitute a structured library of Atomic Strategy Primitives, which translate harmful intents into jailbreak inputs through step-wise transformations. Guided by the primitives, PolyJailbreak employs a multi-agent optimization process that automatically adapts inputs against the target models. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on a variety of open-source and closed-source MLLMs, demonstrating that PolyJailbreak outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance, while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across both benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of IROS 2025</p></details> |

Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs, \textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a \textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks; (2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose \emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics.

While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Multimodal Learning from the Perspective of Mitigating Classification Ability Disproportion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20120v2)** | 2025-10-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.20120v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning (MML) is significantly constrained by modality imbalance, leading to suboptimal performance in practice. While existing approaches primarily focus on balancing the learning of different modalities to address this issue, they fundamentally overlook the inherent disproportion in model classification ability, which serves as the primary cause of this phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach to dynamically balance the classification ability of weak and strong modalities by incorporating the principle of boosting. Concretely, we first propose a sustained boosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the classification and residual errors. Subsequently, we introduce an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to dynamically facilitate the classification performance of the weak modality. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence property of the cross-modal gap function, ensuring the effectiveness of the proposed boosting scheme. To this end, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be balanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue. Empirical experiments on widely used datasets reveal the superiority of our method through comparison with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal learning baselines.

However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Unlike approaches tailored to specific datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection), FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50 on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, accepted at ICCV 2025 MIRA Workshop</p></details> |

Despite advances in robotic platforms, existing systems are predominantly follow-leader in nature, requiring continuous physician input and lacking intelligent autonomy. This dependency contributes to operator fatigue, more radiation exposure, and variability in procedural outcomes. This work moves towards autonomous catheter navigation by introducing DINO-CVA, a multimodal goal-conditioned behavior cloning framework. The proposed model fuses visual observations and joystick kinematics into a joint embedding space, enabling policies that are both vision-aware and kinematic-aware. Actions are predicted autoregressively from expert demonstrations, with goal conditioning guiding navigation toward specified destinations. A robotic experimental setup with a synthetic vascular phantom was designed to collect multimodal datasets and evaluate performance. Results show that DINO-CVA achieves high accuracy in predicting actions, matching the performance of a kinematics-only baseline while additionally grounding predictions in the anatomical environment. These findings establish the feasibility of multimodal, goal-conditioned architectures for catheter navigation, representing an important step toward reducing operator dependency and improving the reliability of catheterbased therapies.</p></details> |  |

Our approach harnesses the capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded, using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlights)</p></details> |

While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual, and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits, including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural correctness.</p></details> |  |

Entities across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references. Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific, we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion. Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines, achieving a 6.93% average improvement.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness - whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions. We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of fine-tuning for stability enhancement.</p></details> | 23 pages,19 figures |

As video length increases, issues such as visual degradation, identity inconsistency, temporal incoherence, and error accumulation become increasingly problematic, severely affecting the realism and reliability of the results. To address these challenges, we present LetsTalk, a diffusion transformer framework equipped with multimodal guidance and a novel memory bank mechanism, explicitly maintaining contextual continuity and enabling robust, high-quality, and efficient generation of long-duration talking videos. In particular, LetsTalk introduces a noise-regularized memory bank to alleviate error accumulation and sampling artifacts during extended video generation. To further improve efficiency and spatiotemporal consistency, LetsTalk employs a deep compression autoencoder and a spatiotemporal-aware transformer with linear attention for effective multimodal fusion. We systematically analyze three fusion schemes and show that combining deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait features and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio achieves superior visual realism and precise speech-driven motion, while preserving diversity of movements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LetsTalk establishes new state-of-the-art in generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic talking videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, and maintains remarkable efficiency with 8x fewer parameters than previous approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing multimodal methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders, utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

Among these, the inclusion of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the way for truly multi-talented, unified models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MKGs often suffer from incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art performance while substantially improving computational efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Deep learning methods have made significant progress, but automatic segmentation still faces challenges, including tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. This paper proposes a three-tier fusion architecture that achieves precise brain tumor segmentation. The method processes information progressively at the pixel, feature, and semantic levels. At the pixel level, physical modeling extends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to multimodal data, including simulated ultrasound and synthetic computed tomography (CT). At the feature level, the method performs Transformer-based cross-modal feature fusion through multi-teacher collaborative distillation, integrating three expert teachers (MRI, US, CT). At the semantic level, clinical textual knowledge generated by GPT-4V is transformed into spatial guidance signals using CLIP contrastive learning and Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). These three tiers together form a complete processing chain from data augmentation to feature extraction to semantic guidance. We validated the method on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020, 2021, and 2023 datasets. The model achieves average Dice coefficients of 0.8665, 0.9014, and 0.8912 on the three datasets, respectively, and reduces the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) by an average of 6.57 millimeters compared with the baseline. This method provides a new paradigm for precise tumor segmentation and boundary localization.</p></details> | 31 pages,3 figures |

These signals support personalized and responsive experiences and may also contain unique patterns that can be linked back to individuals. However, privacy mechanisms that naively pair unimodal mechanisms (e.g., independently apply privacy mechanisms for eye and body privatization) are often ineffective at preventing re-identification in practice. In this work, we systematically evaluate real-time privacy mechanisms for XR, both individually and in pair, across eye and body modalities. We assess privacy through re-identification rates and evaluate utility using numerical performance thresholds derived from existing literature to ensure real-time interaction requirements are met. We evaluated four eye and ten body mechanisms across multiple datasets, comprising up to 407 participants. Our results show that when carefully paired, multimodal mechanisms reduce re-identification rate from 80.3% to 26.3% in casual XR applications (e.g., VRChat and Job Simulator) and from 84.8% to 26.1% in competitive XR applications (e.g., Beat Saber and Synth Riders), all while maintaining acceptable performance based on established thresholds. To facilitate adoption, we additionally release XR Privacy SDK, an open-source toolkit enabling developers to integrate the privacy mechanisms into XR applications for real-time use. These findings underscore the potential of modality-specific and context-aware privacy strategies for protecting behavioral data in XR environments.</p></details> |  |

Previous token compression techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks, that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving 100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by 12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed.

During such critical events, individuals use social media to communicate, sharing multimodal textual and visual content. However, due to the significant influx of unfiltered and diverse data, humanitarian organizations face challenges in leveraging this information efficiently. Existing methods for classifying disaster-related content often fail to model users' credibility, emotional context, and social interaction information, which are essential for accurate classification. To address this gap, we propose CrisisSpot, a method that utilizes a Graph-based Neural Network to capture complex relationships between textual and visual modalities, as well as Social Context Features to incorporate user-centric and content-centric information. We also introduce Inverted Dual Embedded Attention (IDEA), which captures both harmonious and contrasting patterns within the data to enhance multimodal interactions and provide richer insights. Additionally, we present TSEqD (Turkey-Syria Earthquake Dataset), a large annotated dataset for a single disaster event, containing 10,352 samples. Through extensive experiments, CrisisSpot demonstrated significant improvements, achieving an average F1-score gain of 9.45% and 5.01% compared to state-of-the-art methods on the publicly available CrisisMMD dataset and the TSEqD dataset, respectively.</p></details> |  |

While genomic and electrophysiological data such as SNP variants and ECG phenotypes are increasingly accessible, effectively integrating these modalities in low-label settings is non-trivial. This challenge arises from the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets and the high dimensionality of biological signals, which limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised models. To address this, we present a few-label multimodal framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to combine genetic and electrophysiological information for cardiovascular risk stratification. Our approach incorporates a pseudo-label refinement strategy to adaptively distill high-confidence labels from weakly supervised predictions, enabling robust model fine-tuning with only a small set of ground-truth annotations. To enhance the interpretability, we frame the task as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning problem, prompting the model to produce clinically relevant rationales alongside predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of multimodal inputs, few-label supervision, and CoT reasoning improves robustness and generalizability across diverse patient profiles. Experimental results using multimodal SNP variants and ECG-derived features demonstrated comparable performance to models trained on the full dataset, underscoring the promise of LLM-based few-label multimodal modeling for advancing personalized cardiovascular care.</p></details> |  |

A central challenge lies in detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench (Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models (GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%), underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection (EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model (MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset (ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios. Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, the accuracy of such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors.

In this paper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian culture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected over 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore. Each entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and multimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context. We further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and 36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware models.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional multimodal models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks.

A prominent example of this trend are fusion models, which increasingly incorporate multiple biosignals in addition to traditional audiovisual channels. This paper introduces the EASELAN annotation framework to improve annotation workflows designed to address the resulting rising complexity of multimodal and biosignals datasets. It builds on the robust ELAN tool by adding new components tailored to support all stages of the annotation pipeline: From streamlining the preparation of annotation files to setting up additional channels, integrated version control with GitHub, and simplified post-processing. EASELAN delivers a seamless workflow designed to integrate biosignals and facilitate rich annotations to be readily exported for further analyses and machine learning-supported model training. The EASELAN framework is successfully applied to a high-dimensional biosignals collection initiative on human everyday activities (here, table setting) for cognitive robots within the DFG-funded Collaborative Research Center 1320 Everyday Activity Science and Engineering (EASE). In this paper we discuss the opportunities, limitations, and lessons learned when using EASELAN for this initiative. To foster research on biosignal collection, annotation, and processing, the code of EASELAN is publicly available(https://github.com/cognitive-systems-lab/easelan), along with the EASELAN-supported fully annotated Table Setting Database.</p></details> |  |

Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources. However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability. To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework (FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task. Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous, modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate constraint paradigms for representation learning. Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge transfer. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing modalities.</p></details> | 6 pages,3 figures |

Despite this need, existing medical AI systems disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements across diverse medical vision-language tasks.

While existing approaches have achieved notable results in verifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1) Existing methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting local object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge and entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for fake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and NLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to semantically grounded verification.

However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Two context generation strategies are examined: one focused on named entities and the other on full-text prompting. Four methods of incorporating context into the classifier input are compared: text concatenation, embedding concatenation, a hierarchical transformer-based fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments are conducted on the textual Latent Hatred dataset of implicit hate speech and applied in a multimodal setting on the MAMI dataset of misogynous memes. Results suggest that both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated are key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups respectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system, based on embedding concatenation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, submitted to LREC 2026</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD, particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for neuro-oncological imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, BraTS GoAT 2025 challenge</p></details> |

Conventional approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships, are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset longevity in industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Sensors Journal</p></details> |

Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately 9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities, for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference Full Paper</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

However, mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs, thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs. Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers, providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus, we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce MRSAudio, a large-scale multimodal spatial audio dataset designed to advance research in spatial audio understanding and generation. MRSAudio spans four distinct components: MRSLife, MRSSpeech, MRSMusic, and MRSSing, covering diverse real-world scenarios. The dataset includes synchronized binaural and ambisonic audio, exocentric and egocentric video, motion trajectories, and fine-grained annotations such as transcripts, phoneme boundaries, lyrics, scores, and prompts. To demonstrate the utility and versatility of MRSAudio, we establish five foundational tasks: audio spatialization, and spatial text to speech, spatial singing voice synthesis, spatial music generation and sound event localization and detection. Results show that MRSAudio enables high-quality spatial modeling and supports a broad range of spatial audio research.

Existing AQA datasets, however, are limited to single-view competitive sports and RGB video, lacking multimodal signals and professional assessment of fitness actions. We introduce FLEX, the first large-scale, multimodal, multiview dataset for fitness AQA that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG). FLEX contains over 7,500 multiview recordings of 20 weight-loaded exercises performed by 38 subjects of diverse skill levels, with synchronized RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological signals. Expert annotations are organized into a Fitness Knowledge Graph (FKG) linking actions, key steps, error types, and feedback, supporting a compositional scoring function for interpretable quality assessment. FLEX enables multimodal fusion, cross-modal prediction -- including the novel Video$\rightarrow$EMG task -- and biomechanically oriented representation learning. Building on the FKG, we further introduce FLEX-VideoQA, a structured question-answering benchmark with hierarchical queries that drive cross-modal reasoning in vision-language models. Baseline experiments demonstrate that multimodal inputs, multiview video, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance AQA performance. FLEX thus advances AQA toward richer multimodal settings and provides a foundation for AI-powered fitness assessment and coaching.

Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i) encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and (iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases, we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval.

Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text, tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG. This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities, unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.</p></details> |  |

To address the challenge of collecting diverse labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to the community for reproduction and further development.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages sequential comic-style visual narratives to circumvent safety alignments in state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our method decomposes malicious queries into visually innocuous storytelling elements using an auxiliary LLM, generates corresponding image sequences through diffusion models, and exploits the models' reliance on narrative coherence to elicit harmful outputs. Extensive experiments on harmful textual queries from established safety benchmarks show that our approach achieves an average attack success rate of 83.5\%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 46\%. Compared with existing visual jailbreak methods, our sequential narrative strategy demonstrates superior effectiveness across diverse categories of harmful content. We further analyze attack patterns, uncover key vulnerability factors in multimodal safety mechanisms, and evaluate the limitations of current defense strategies against narrative-driven attacks, revealing significant gaps in existing protections.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity, strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing. Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project Page: https://mathcanvas.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mathcanvas.github.io/</p></details> |

Unlike previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer, where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization, we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance. The code of our method will be made public.</p></details> |  |

However, can multimodal generative models effectively produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200 unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Multimodal LLM Descriptions of Activity for Explainable Semi-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14896v1)** | 2025-10-16 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.14896v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level, our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets without interaction anomalies.</p></details> |  |

Although numerous well-known benchmarks exist to evaluate model performance, they increasingly have insufficient headroom. As such, there is a pressing need for a new generation of benchmarks challenging enough for the next generation of LMMs. One area that LMMs show potential is graph analysis, specifically, the tasks an analyst might typically perform when interpreting figures such as estimating the mean, intercepts or correlations of functions and data series. In this work, we introduce GRAB, a graph analysis benchmark, fit for current and future frontier LMMs. Our benchmark is predominantly synthetic, ensuring high-quality, noise-free questions. GRAB is comprised of 3284 questions, covering five tasks and 23 graph properties. We evaluate 20 LMMs on GRAB, finding it to be a challenging benchmark, with the highest performing model attaining a score of just 21.0%. Finally, we conduct various ablations to investigate where the models succeed and struggle. We release GRAB and a lightweight GRAB-Lite to encourage progress in this important, growing domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings, we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV26. 12 pages, 8 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, their potential in face recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work, we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition, offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy and generalization.

| **[Supervised Fine-Tuning or Contrastive Learning? Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14824v1)** | 2025-10-16 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2510.14824v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders, various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts ''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components: weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and applications in this area.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.</p></details> |  |

Our approach proposes novel optimizations at all levels, including logical, physical, and semantic query transformations that reduce model load to improve throughput while preserving accuracy. We demonstrate this with \system{}, a prototype leveraging such optimizations to improve performance by more than an order of magnitude. Moreover, we discuss a research roadmap that outlines open research challenges for building a scalable and efficient multimodal stream processing systems.</p></details> |  |

MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal, where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling effective multimodal retrieval.

In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can sidestep this requirement by classifying images directly using natural language (e.g., answering the prompt "What is the main object in the image?"). Despite this remarkable capability, most existing studies on LMM classification performance are surprisingly limited in scope, often assuming a closed-world setting with a predefined set of categories. In this work, we address this gap by thoroughly evaluating LMM classification performance in a truly open-world setting. We first formalize the task and introduce an evaluation protocol, defining various metrics to assess the alignment between predicted and ground truth classes. We then evaluate 13 models across 10 benchmarks, encompassing prototypical, non-prototypical, fine-grained, and very fine-grained classes, demonstrating the challenges LMMs face in this task. Further analyses based on the proposed metrics reveal the types of errors LMMs make, highlighting challenges related to granularity and fine-grained capabilities, showing how tailored prompting and reasoning can alleviate them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV2025, 23 pages, 13 figures, code is available at https://github.com/altndrr/lmms-owc</p></details> |

However, achieving multimodal IAD in practical production lines remains a work in progress. It is essential to consider the trade-offs between the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of new modalities while ensuring compatibility with current processes. Existing quality control processes combine rapid in-line inspections, such as optical and infrared imaging with high-resolution but time-consuming near-line characterization techniques, including industrial CT and electron microscopy to manually or semi-automatically locate and analyze defects in the production of Li-ion batteries and composite materials. Given the cost and time limitations, only a subset of the samples can be inspected by all in-line and near-line methods, and the remaining samples are only evaluated through one or two forms of in-line inspection. To fully exploit data for deep learning-driven automatic defect detection, the models must have the ability to leverage multimodal training and handle incomplete modalities during inference. In this paper, we propose CMDIAD, a Cross-Modal Distillation framework for IAD to demonstrate the feasibility of a Multi-modal Training, Few-modal Inference (MTFI) pipeline. Our findings show that the MTFI pipeline can more effectively utilize incomplete multimodal information compared to applying only a single modality for training and inference. Moreover, we investigate the reasons behind the asymmetric performance improvement using point clouds or RGB images as the main modality of inference. This provides a foundation for our future multimodal dataset construction with additional modalities from manufacturing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For a published version refer to the Information Fusion, DOI. 10.1016/j.inffus.2025.103572</p></details> |

While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines.

This disconnect leads to a spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent. Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent, credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework: ``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition, the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms. Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear, structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.</p></details> |  |

Contrary to the common practice that fine-tunes LMMs with additional grounding supervision, we find that the grounding ability can in fact emerge in LMMs trained without explicit grounding supervision. To reveal this emerging grounding, we introduce an "attend-and-segment" method which leverages attention maps from standard LMMs to perform pixel-level segmentation. Furthermore, to enhance the grounding ability, we propose DIFFLMM, an LMM utilizing a diffusion-based visual encoder, as opposed to the standard CLIP visual encoder, and trained with the same weak supervision. Without being constrained by the biases and limited scale of grounding-specific supervision data, our approach is more generalizable and scalable. We achieve competitive performance on both grounding-specific and general visual question answering benchmarks, compared with grounding LMMs and generalist LMMs, respectively. Notably, we achieve a 44.2 grounding mask recall on grounded conversation generation without any grounding supervision, outperforming the extensively supervised model GLaMM.

Additionally, we present FakeClue, a comprehensive dataset containing over 100,000 images across seven categories, annotated with fine-grained artifact clues in natural language. FakeVLM demonstrates performance comparable to expert models while eliminating the need for additional classifiers, making it a robust solution for synthetic data detection.

However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

In this paper, we introduce EMAC+, an Embodied Multimodal Agent that collaboratively integrates LLM and VLM via a bidirectional training paradigm. Unlike existing methods, EMAC+ dynamically refines high-level textual plans generated by an LLM using real-time feedback from a VLM executing low-level visual control tasks. We address critical limitations of previous models by enabling the LLM to internalize visual environment dynamics directly through interactive experience, rather than relying solely on static symbolic mappings. Extensive experimental evaluations on ALFWorld and RT-1 benchmarks demonstrate that EMAC+ achieves superior task performance, robustness against noisy observations, and efficient learning. We also conduct thorough ablation studies and provide detailed analyses of success and failure cases.</p></details> |  |

Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at APSIPA ASC 2025</p></details> |

Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored. Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce VisualToolBench, a visual tool-use reasoning benchmark that rigorously evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under the think-with-images paradigm. VisualToolBench comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with images, VisualToolBench offers critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing EO foundation models are typically tailored to specific sensor types, making them inflexible when generalizing across the heterogeneous landscape of EO data. To address this, we propose the Dynamic One-For-All (DOFA) model, a unified, multimodal foundation framework designed for diverse vision tasks in EO. Inspired by neural plasticity, DOFA utilizes a wavelength-conditioned dynamic hypernetwork to process inputs from five distinct satellite sensors flexibly. By continually pretraining on five EO modalities, DOFA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks and generalizes well to unseen modalities. Enhanced with hybrid continual pretraining, DOFA+ requires significantly fewer computational resources while outperforming counterparts trained with extensive GPU budgets. Experiments on diverse datasets highlight DOFA's potential as a foundation for general-purpose vision models in the sensor-diverse EO domain. The code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/DOFA.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

We propose a lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature, humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37 training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO. Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau} =0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9: 61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con- servation decision support systems.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the lack of integrated solutions capable of simultaneously monitoring motor recovery and providing intelligent assistance in home environments hampers rehabilitation outcomes. Here, we present a multimodal smart home platform designed for continuous, at-home rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, integrating wearable sensing, ambient monitoring, and adaptive automation. A plantar pressure insole equipped with a machine learning pipeline classifies users into motor recovery stages with up to 94\% accuracy, enabling quantitative tracking of walking patterns during daily activities. An optional head-mounted eye-tracking module, together with ambient sensors such as cameras and microphones, supports seamless hands-free control of household devices with a 100\% success rate and sub-second response time. These data streams are fused locally via a hierarchical Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, ensuring low latency and data privacy. An embedded large language model (LLM) agent, Auto-Care, continuously interprets multimodal data to provide real-time interventions -- issuing personalized reminders, adjusting environmental conditions, and notifying caregivers. Implemented in a post-stroke context, this integrated smart home platform increased mean user satisfaction from 3.9 $\pm$ 0.8 in conventional home environments to 8.4 $\pm$ 0.6 with the full system ($n=20$). Beyond stroke, the system offers a scalable, patient-centered framework with potential for long-term use in broader neurorehabilitation and aging-in-place applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 fig...</summary><p>5 figures, 41 references</p></details> |

This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3). Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios. Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7), and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods, such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and controllable next-generation reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data, cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training. UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability across diverse data availability scenarios.

To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles. Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs.

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability. Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage. 2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945 real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image understanding.

But often, the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training. Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks: excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance, and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion (PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal the effectiveness of PCDF.</p></details> |  |

However, the rapid growth of these datasets introduces significant redundancy, leading to increased computational costs. Existing methods for selecting instruction data aim to prune this redundancy, but predominantly rely on computationally demanding techniques such as proxy-based inference or training-based metrics. Consequently, the substantial computational costs incurred by these selection processes often exacerbate the very efficiency bottlenecks they are intended to resolve, posing a significant challenge to the scalable and effective tuning of MLLMs. To address this challenge, we first identify a critical, yet previously overlooked, factor: the anisotropy inherent in visual feature distributions. We find that this anisotropy induces a \textit{Global Semantic Drift}, and overlooking this phenomenon is a key factor limiting the efficiency of current data selection methods. Motivated by this insight, we devise \textbf{PRISM}, the first training-free framework for efficient visual instruction selection. PRISM surgically removes the corrupting influence of global background features by modeling the intrinsic visual semantics via implicit re-centering. Empirically, PRISM reduces the end-to-end time for data selection and model tuning to just 30\% of conventional pipelines. More remarkably, it achieves this efficiency while simultaneously enhancing performance, surpassing models fine-tuned on the full dataset across eight multimodal and three language understanding benchmarks, culminating in a 101.7\% relative improvement over the baseline.

Meanwhile, we also analyze the architectural characteristics and practical implementations of these fusion strategies in key tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation, and manipulation. We compare the evolutionary paths and applicability of VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion methods.Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios.

Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model. Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios, however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world multimodal deception detection.</p></details> |  |

Due to the lack of available quality-rated medical images, most commonly used IQA methods employing reference images (i.e. full-reference IQA) have been developed and tested for natural images. Reported application inconsistencies arising when employing such measures for medical images are not surprising, as they rely on different properties than natural images. In photoacoustic imaging (PAI), especially, standard benchmarking approaches for assessing the quality of image reconstructions are lacking. PAI is a multi-physics imaging modality, in which two inverse problems have to be solved, which makes the application of IQA measures uniquely challenging due to both, acoustic and optical, artifacts. To support the development and testing of full- and no-reference IQA measures we assembled PhotIQA, a data set consisting of 1134 reconstructed photoacoustic (PA) images that were rated by 2 experts across five quality properties (overall quality, edge visibility, homogeneity, inclusion and background intensity), where the detailed rating enables usage beyond PAI. To allow full-reference assessment, highly characterised imaging test objects were used, providing a ground truth. Our baseline experiments show that HaarPSI$_{med}$ significantly outperforms SSIM in correlating with the quality ratings (SRCC: 0.83 vs. 0.62). The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13325196.</p></details> | 12 pages |

No-reference image quality measures are often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost.

| **[Super-temporal-resolution Photoacoustic Imaging with Dynamic Reconstruction through Implicit Neural Representation in Sparse-view](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03175v1)** | 2025-05-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03175v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is an important imaging technique for monitoring physiological processes, capable of providing high-contrast images of optical absorption at much greater depths than traditional optical imaging methods. However, practical instrumentation and geometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the imaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data, produce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not consider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution is crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by the low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser technology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by characterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to improve dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and enhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input. Specifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as implicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the network are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the need for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong implicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit regularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms traditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions, effectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.</p></details> |  |

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |

Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab.

Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images.

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images.

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
