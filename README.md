| **[Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting with Covariates via In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03128v1)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03128v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained time series models, capable of zero-shot forecasting, have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing both the performance and accessibility of time series forecasting. However, existing pretrained models either do not support covariates or fail to incorporate them effectively. We introduce COSMIC, a zero-shot forecasting model that utilizes covariates via in-context learning. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose Informative Covariate Augmentation, which enables the training of COSMIC without requiring any datasets that include covariates. COSMIC achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot forecasting, both with and without covariates. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrates that COSMIC effectively leverages covariates in zero-shot forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was written at the end of 2024</p></details> |

Firstly, the basic information and transaction data of popular NFTs on the Solana chain are collected using the Selenium tool. Secondly, the transaction records of the Magic Eden trading market are thoroughly analyzed by combining them with the Scrapy framework to examine the price fluctuations and market trends of NFTs. In terms of data analysis, this paper employs time series analysis to examine the dynamics of the NFT market and seeks to identify potential price patterns. In addition, the risk and return of different NFTs are evaluated using the mean-variance optimization model, taking into account their characteristics, such as illiquidity and market volatility, to provide investors with data-driven portfolio recommendations. The experimental results show that the combination of crawler technology and financial analytics can effectively analyze NFT data on the Solana blockchain and provide timely market insights and investment strategies. This study provides a reference for further exploration in the field of digital currencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binary Cumulative Encoding meets Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24595v2)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.24595v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding (BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Soft Sparse Shapes for Efficient Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06892v2)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.06892v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shapelets are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time series classification. Due to the time-intensive nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification performance. To this end, we propose a Soft sparse Shapes (SoftShape) model for efficient time series classification. Our approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces interpretable results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[XicorAttention: Time Series Transformer Using Attention with Nonlinear Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02694v1)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.02694v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various Transformer-based models have been proposed for time series forecasting. These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\% compared to existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic mapping from static labels: remote sensing dynamic sample generation with temporal-spectral embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02574v1)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.02574v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate remote sensing geographic mapping depends heavily on representative and timely sample data. However, rapid changes in land surface dynamics necessitate frequent updates, quickly rendering previously collected samples obsolete and imposing significant labor demands for continuous manual updates. In this study, we aim to address this problem by dynamic sample generation using existing single-date static labeled samples. We introduce TasGen, a two-stage automated framework to automatically generate dynamic samples, designed to simultaneously model spectral and temporal dependencies in time-series remote sensing imagery via temporal-spectral embedding, capturing land surface changes without additional manual annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDE: A Simplified and Disentangled Dependency Encoding Framework for State Space Models in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12068v3)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2408.12068v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, advancements in deep learning have spurred the development of numerous models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, most existing approaches struggle to fully capture the complex and structured dependencies inherent in time series data. In this work, we identify and formally define three critical dependencies that are fundamental to forecasting accuracy: order dependency and semantic dependency along the temporal dimension, as well as cross-variate dependency across the feature dimension. These dependencies are often treated in isolation, and improper handling can introduce noise and degrade forecasting performance. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential of State Space Models (SSMs) for LTSF and emphasize their inherent advantages in capturing these essential dependencies. Additionally, we empirically observe that excessive nonlinearity in conventional SSMs introduce redundancy when applied to semantically sparse time series data. Motivated by this insight, we propose SDE (Simplified and Disentangled Dependency Encoding), a novel framework designed to enhance the capability of SSMs for LTSF. Specifically, we first eliminate unnecessary nonlinearities in vanilla SSMs, thereby improving the suitability for time series forecasting. Building on this foundation, we introduce a disentangled encoding strategy, which empowers SSMs to efficiently model cross-variate dependencies while mitigating interference between the temporal and feature dimensions. Furthermore, we provide rigorous theoretical justifications to substantiate our design choices. Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDE-enhanced SSMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art time series forecasting models.Our code is available at https://github.com/YukinoAsuna/SAMBA.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[Forecasting Company Fundamentals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05791v2)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.05791v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Company fundamentals are key to assessing companies' financial and overall success and stability. Forecasting them is important in multiple fields, including investing and econometrics. While statistical and contemporary machine learning methods have been applied to many time series tasks, there is a lack of comparison of these approaches on this particularly challenging data regime. To this end, we try to bridge this gap and thoroughly evaluate the theoretical properties and practical performance of 24 deterministic and probabilistic company fundamentals forecasting models on real company data. We observe that deep learning models provide superior forecasting performance to classical models, in particular when considering uncertainty estimation. To validate the findings, we compare them to human analyst expectations and find that their accuracy is comparable to the automatic forecasts. We further show how these high-quality forecasts can benefit automated stock allocation. We close by presenting possible ways of integrating domain experts to further improve performance and increase reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>See h...</summary><p>See https://openreview.net/forum?id=haf78jerSt</p></details> |
| **[Dynamical Label Augmentation and Calibration for Noisy Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07320v2)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.07320v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical research, particularly in predicting patient outcomes, heavily relies on medical time series data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR), which provide extensive information on patient histories. Despite rigorous examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic \textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy \textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set. Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under high noise levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Latent Causal Graphs from Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05331v2)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.05331v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use \change{spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions}, to map observational time series to latent representations. \change{Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability.} Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Forecasting of Sparse Intraoperative Hypotension Events Powered by Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22116v2)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.22116v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Univariate to Multivariate: LLMs as Zero-Shot Predictors for Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02389v1)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.02389v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series prediction or forecasting is critical across many real-world dynamic systems, and recent studies have proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task due to their strong generalization capabilities and ability to perform well without extensive pre-training. However, their effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences. Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performative Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06077v2)** | 2025-06-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2310.06077v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is a critical challenge in various domains and has witnessed substantial progress in recent years. Many real-life scenarios, such as public health, economics, and social applications, involve feedback loops where predictions can influence the predicted outcome, subsequently altering the target variable's distribution. This phenomenon, known as performativity, introduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions. Despite extensive studies in classification problems across domains, performativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series forecasting from a machine-learning perspective. In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS), addressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced distribution shifts are possible. We propose a novel approach, Feature Performative-Shifting (FPS), which leverages the concept of delayed response to anticipate distribution shifts and subsequently predicts targets accordingly. We provide theoretical insights suggesting that FPS can potentially lead to reduced generalization error. We conduct comprehensive experiments using multiple time-series models on COVID-19 and traffic forecasting tasks. The results demonstrate that FPS consistently outperforms conventional time-series forecasting methods, highlighting its efficacy in handling performativity-induced challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (8 main text, 1 reference, 3 appendix), 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02549v2)** | 2025-06-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.02549v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data imputation and data generation have important applications for many domains, like healthcare and finance, where incomplete or missing data can hinder accurate analysis and decision-making. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Time-Series Signal Analysis with Autoencoders and Vision Transformers: A Review of Architectures and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16972v2)** | 2025-06-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.16972v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of unlabeled time-series data in domains such as wireless communications, radar, biomedical engineering, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven advancements in unsupervised learning. This review synthesizes recent progress in applying autoencoders and vision transformers for unsupervised signal analysis, focusing on their architectures, applications, and emerging trends. We explore how these models enable feature extraction, anomaly detection, and classification across diverse signal types, including electrocardiograms, radar waveforms, and IoT sensor data. The review highlights the strengths of hybrid architectures and self-supervised learning, while identifying challenges in interpretability, scalability, and domain generalization. By bridging methodological innovations and practical applications, this work offers a roadmap for developing robust, adaptive models for signal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Detection of Patient Deterioration from Real-Time Wearable Monitoring System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01305v2)** | 2025-06-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.01305v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of patient deterioration is crucial for reducing mortality rates. Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time respiratory motion forecasting with online learning of recurrent neural networks for accurate targeting in externally guided radiotherapy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01607v2)** | 2025-06-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2403.01607v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In lung radiotherapy, infrared cameras can track reflective objects on the chest to estimate tumor motion due to breathing, but treatment system latencies hinder radiation beam precision. Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is a potential solution that can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D positions of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI that compress the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and accurately update the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. Data was originally sampled at 10Hz; we resampled it at 3.33Hz and 30Hz to analyze the effect of the sampling rate on performance. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons h<=2.1s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, kernel support vector regression, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSEs) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the lowest nRMSE at 30Hz, equal to 0.086. DNI's inference time (6.8ms per time step at 30Hz, Intel Core i7-13700 CPU) was the lowest among the RNN methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 18 figures, accepted manuscript version</p></details> |

This interconnectedness and sensitivity of financial markets make understanding these relationships crucial for investors and policymakers to predict stock price movements accurately. To this end, we examined the main stock market indices of G7 and MINT countries from 2012 to 2024, using a recent graph neural network (GNN) algorithm called multivariate time series forecasting with graph neural network (MTGNN). This method allows for considering complex spatio-temporal connections in multivariate time series. In the implementations, MTGNN revealed that the US and Canada are the most influential G7 countries regarding stock indices in the forecasting process, and Indonesia and T\"urkiye are the most influential MINT countries. Additionally, our results showed that MTGNN outperformed traditional methods in forecasting the prices of stock market indices for MINT and G7 countries. Consequently, the study offers valuable insights into economic blocks' markets and presents a compelling empirical approach to analyzing global stock market dynamics using MTGNN.</p></details> |  |

The competition idea is based on one of the real-life AI security threats identified within the project -- the adversarial poisoning of continuously fine-tuned satellite telemetry forecasting models. The task is to develop methods for finding and reconstructing triggers (trojans) in advanced models for satellite telemetry forecasting used in safety-critical space operations. Participants are provided with 1) a large public dataset of real-life multivariate satellite telemetry (without triggers), 2) a reference model trained on the clean data, 3) a set of poisoned neural hierarchical interpolation (N-HiTS) models for time series forecasting trained on the dataset with injected triggers, and 4) Jupyter notebook with the training pipeline and baseline algorithm (the latter will be published in the last month of the competition). The main task of the competition is to reconstruct a set of 45 triggers (i.e., short multivariate time series segments) injected into the training data of the corresponding set of 45 poisoned models. The exact characteristics (i.e., shape, amplitude, and duration) of these triggers must be identified by participants. The popular Neural Cleanse method is adopted as a baseline, but it is not designed for time series analysis and new approaches are necessary for the task. The impact of the competition is not limited to the space domain, but also to many other safety-critical applications of advanced time series analysis where model poisoning may lead to serious consequences.</p></details> |  |

In federated learning (FL), where multiple decentralized clients collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, significant challenges include statistical heterogeneity, high communication costs, and privacy concerns. FedGenGMM addresses these issues by allowing local GMM models, trained independently on client devices, to be aggregated through a single communication round. This approach leverages the generative property of GMMs, enabling the creation of a synthetic dataset on the server side to train a global model efficiently. Evaluation across diverse datasets covering image, tabular, and time series data demonstrates that FedGenGMM consistently achieves performance comparable to non-federated and iterative federated methods, even under significant data heterogeneity. Additionally, FedGenGMM significantly reduces communication overhead, maintains robust performance in anomaly detection tasks, and offers flexibility in local model complexities, making it particularly suitable for edge computing environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Data Augmentation for Time-Series Classification: An Extensive Empirical Study and Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10060v7)** | 2025-06-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2310.10060v7) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data Augmentation (DA) has become a critical approach in Time Series Classification (TSC), primarily for its capacity to expand training datasets, enhance model robustness, introduce diversity, and reduce overfitting. However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible and user-oriented tools. This study addresses these challenges through a comprehensive examination of DA methodologies within the TSC domain.Our research began with an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing significant gaps in existing surveys and necessitating a detailed analysis of over 100 scholarly articles to identify more than 60 distinct DA techniques. This rigorous review led to the development of a novel taxonomy tailored to the specific needs of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five primary categories: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. This taxonomy is intended to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods with greater clarity. In response to the lack of comprehensive evaluations of foundational DA techniques, we conducted a thorough empirical study, testing nearly 20 DA strategies across 15 diverse datasets representing all types within the UCR time-series repository. Using ResNet and LSTM architectures, we employed a multifaceted evaluation approach, including metrics such as Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, resulting in a benchmark accuracy of 84.98 +- 16.41% in ResNet and 82.41 +- 18.71% in LSTM. Our investigation underscored the inconsistent efficacies of DA techniques, for instance, methods like RGWs and Random Permutation significantly improved model performance, whereas others, like EMD, were less effective.</p></details> |  |

Such characteristics align closely with the demands of ubiquitous computing systems, which often operate on resource-constrained devices while continuously monitoring and processing time-series sensor data. Despite their unique and promising features, SNNs have received limited attention and remain underexplored (or at least, under-adopted) within the ubiquitous computing community. To address this gap, this paper first introduces the core components of SNNs, both in terms of models and training mechanisms. It then presents a systematic survey of 76 SNN-based studies focused on time-series data analysis, categorizing them into six key application domains. For each domain, we summarize relevant works and subsequent advancements, distill core insights, and highlight key takeaways for researchers and practitioners. To facilitate hands-on experimentation, we also provide a comprehensive review of current software frameworks and neuromorphic hardware platforms, detailing their capabilities and specifications, and then offering tailored recommendations for selecting development tools based on specific application needs. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges within each application domain and propose future research directions that need be explored in ubiquitous community. Our survey highlights the transformative potential of SNNs in enabling energy-efficient ubiquitous sensing across diverse application domains, while also serving as an essential introduction for researchers looking to enter this emerging field.</p></details> | 50 pages |

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted by IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI 2025)</p></details> |

By integrating implicit neural representations with latent variable models, TV-INRs learn distributions over time-continuous generator functions conditioned on signal-specific covariates. Unlike existing approaches that require extensive training, fine-tuning or meta-learning, our method achieves accurate individualized predictions through a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that with a single TV-INRs instance, we can accurately solve diverse imputation and forecasting tasks, offering a computationally efficient and scalable solution for real-world applications. TV-INRs excel especially in low-data regimes, where it outperforms existing methods by an order of magnitude in mean squared error for imputation task.</p></details> |  |

While the majority of CD methods rely on synthetic data for evaluation, and recently for training, these fall short in accurately mirroring real-world scenarios; an effect even more evident in temporal data. Generation techniques depending on simplified assumptions on causal structure, effects and time, limit the quality and diversity of the simulated data. In this work, we introduce Temporal Causal-based Simulation (TCS), a robust framework for generating realistic time-series data and their associated temporal causal graphs. The approach is structured in three phases: estimating the true lagged causal structure of the data, approximating the functional dependencies between variables and learning the noise distribution of the corresponding causal model, each part of which can be explicitly tailored based on data assumptions and characteristics. Through an extensive evaluation process, we highlight that single detection methods for generated data discrimination prove inadequate, accentuating it as a multifaceted challenge. For this, we detail a Min-max optimization phase that draws on AutoML techniques. Our contributions include a flexible, model-agnostic pipeline for generating realistic temporal causal data, a thorough evaluation setup which enhances the validity of the generated datasets and insights into the challenges posed by realistic data generation. Through experiments involving not only real but also semi-synthetic and purely synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that while sampling realistic causal data remains a complex task, our method enriches the domain of generating sensible causal-based temporal data.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

However, their performances vary between different domains and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model (RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

The sequential nature of data collected from these environments has enabled improvements in Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models by processing time windows rather than treating the data as tabular. However, conventional explanation methods often neglect this temporal structure, leading to imprecise or less actionable explanations. This work presents ShaTS (Shapley values for Time Series models), which is a model-agnostic explainable Artificial Intelligence method designed to enhance the precision of Shapley value explanations for time series models. ShaTS addresses the shortcomings of traditional approaches by incorporating an a priori feature grouping strategy that preserves temporal dependencies and produces both coherent and actionable insights. Experiments conducted on the SWaT dataset demonstrate that ShaTS accurately identifies critical time instants, precisely pinpoints the sensors, actuators, and processes affected by anomalies, and outperforms SHAP in terms of both explainability and resource efficiency, fulfilling the real-time requirements of industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages;16 figures;Submitted to Elsevier (Information Fusion)</p></details> |

However, such datasets remain scarce, and existing synthetic alternatives often overlook critical temporal properties inherent in real-world data, including nonstationarity driven by trends and seasonality, irregular sampling intervals, and the presence of unobserved confounders. To address these challenges, we introduce TimeGraph, a comprehensive suite of synthetic time-series benchmark datasets that systematically incorporates both linear and nonlinear dependencies while modeling key temporal characteristics such as trends, seasonal effects, and heterogeneous noise patterns. Each dataset is accompanied by a fully specified causal graph featuring varying densities and diverse noise distributions and is provided in two versions: one including unobserved confounders and one without, thereby offering extensive coverage of real-world complexity while preserving methodological neutrality. We further demonstrate the utility of TimeGraph through systematic evaluations of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms including PCMCI+, LPCMCI, and FGES across a diverse array of configurations and metrics. Our experiments reveal significant variations in algorithmic performance under realistic temporal conditions, underscoring the need for robust synthetic benchmarks in the fair and transparent assessment of causal discovery methods. The complete TimeGraph suite, including dataset generation scripts, evaluation metrics, and recommended experimental protocols, is freely available to facilitate reproducible research and foster community-driven advancements in time-series causal discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, accepted at KDD 2025 (Datasets and Benchmarks Track)</p></details> |

MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content, what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it. To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly, automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency before and after significant events.</p></details> | 19 pages, 15 figures |
| **[TSRating: Rating Quality of Diverse Time Series Data by Meta-learning from LLM Judgment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01290v1)** | 2025-06-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.01290v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality time series (TS) data are essential for ensuring TS model performance, rendering research on rating TS data quality indispensable. Existing methods have shown promising rating accuracy within individual domains, primarily by extending data quality rating techniques such as influence functions and Shapley values to account for temporal characteristics. However, they neglect the fact that real-world TS data can span vastly different domains and exhibit distinct properties, hampering the accurate and efficient rating of diverse TS data. In this paper, we propose TSRating, a novel and unified framework for rating the quality of time series data crawled from diverse domains. TSRating is built on the assumption that LLMs inherit ample knowledge, acquired during their extensive pretraining, enabling them to comprehend and discern quality differences in diverse TS data. We verify this assumption by devising a series of prompts to elicit quality comparisons from LLMs for pairs of TS samples. We then fit a dedicated rating model, termed TSRater, to convert the LLMs' judgments into efficient quality predictions via TSRater's inference on future TS samples. To ensure cross-domain adaptability, we develop a meta-learning scheme to train TSRater on quality comparisons collected from nine distinct domains. To improve training efficiency, we employ signSGD for inner-loop updates, thus circumventing the demanding computation of hypergradients. Extensive experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets across three time series tasks, each using both conventional TS models and TS foundation models, demonstrate that TSRating outperforms baselines in terms of estimation accuracy, efficiency, and domain adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which collapse temporal dynamics into fixed-dimensional hidden states, WARP explicitly parametrizes the hidden state as the weights of a distinct root neural network. This formulation promotes higher-resolution memory, gradient-free adaptation at test-time, and seamless integration of domain-specific physical priors. Empirical validation shows that WARP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on diverse classification tasks, spanning synthetic benchmarks to real-world datasets. Furthermore, extensive experiments across sequential image completion, dynamical system reconstruction, and multivariate time series forecasting demonstrate its expressiveness and generalization capabilities. Critically, WARP's weight trajectories offer valuable insights into the model's inner workings. Ablation studies confirm the architectural necessity of key components, solidifying weight-space linear RNNs as a transformative paradigm for adaptive machine intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 21 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Classical time series classification and deep learning techniques have demonstrated limited efficacy in monitoring PD symptoms using wearable accelerometer data due to complex PD movement patterns and the small size of available datasets. We investigate InceptionTime and RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) as they are promising for PD symptom monitoring. InceptionTime's high learning capacity is well-suited to modeling complex movement patterns, while ROCKET is suited to small datasets. With random search methodology, we identify the highest-scoring InceptionTime architecture and compare its performance to ROCKET with a ridge classifier and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on wrist motion data from PD patients. Our findings indicate that all approaches can learn to estimate tremor severity and bradykinesia presence with moderate performance but encounter challenges in detecting dyskinesia. Among the presented approaches, ROCKET demonstrates higher scores in identifying dyskinesia, whereas InceptionTime exhibits slightly better performance in tremor and bradykinesia estimation. Notably, both methods outperform the multi-layer perceptron. In conclusion, InceptionTime can classify complex wrist motion time series and holds potential for continuous symptom monitoring in PD with further development.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available from https://github.com/cedricdonie/tsc-for-wrist-motion-pd-detection</p></details> |

With recent progress in large language models and time series learning, we revisit the integration of paired texts with time series through the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that representations of different modalities converge to shared spaces. In this context, we identify that time-series-paired texts may naturally exhibit periodic properties that closely mirror those of the original time series. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, Texts as Time Series (TaTS), which considers the time-series-paired texts to be auxiliary variables of the time series. TaTS can be plugged into any existing numerical-only time series models and enable them to handle time series data with paired texts effectively. Through extensive experiments on both multimodal time series forecasting and imputation tasks across benchmark datasets with various existing time series models, we demonstrate that TaTS can enhance predictive performance without modifying model architectures.

To address this, we propose Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), a novel hybrid architecture that enhances classical Transformer models with a quantum attention mechanism. QASA replaces dot-product attention with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) that adaptively captures inter-token relationships in the quantum Hilbert space. Additionally, a residual quantum projection module is introduced before the feedforward network to further refine temporal features. Our design retains classical efficiency in earlier layers while injecting quantum expressiveness in the final encoder block, ensuring compatibility with current NISQ hardware. Experiments on synthetic time-series tasks demonstrate that QASA achieves faster convergence and superior generalization compared to both standard Transformers and reduced classical variants. Preliminary complexity analysis suggests potential quantum advantages in gradient computation, opening new avenues for efficient quantum deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support scalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894 live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with objective network-based QoE estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pp...</summary><p>19 ppages, 13 figures</p></details> |

With growing interest in applying LLMs to the time series domain, this has proven nontrivial, as evidenced by the limited efficacy of straightforwardly adapting text-domain reasoning techniques. Although recent work has shown promise in several time series tasks, further leveraging advancements in LLM reasoning remains under-explored for time series classification (TSC) tasks, despite their prevalence and significance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ReasonTSC, a novel framework designed to effectively leverage LLM reasoning for time series classification through both a multi-turn reasoning and a fused decision-making strategy tailored to TSC. Rather than straightforwardly applying existing reasoning techniques or relying solely on LLMs' built-in reasoning capabilities, ReasonTSC first steers the model to think over the essential characteristics of time series data. Next, it integrates predictions and confidence scores from plug-in classifiers, e.g., domain-specific time series models, as in-context examples. Finally, ReasonTSC guides the LLM through a structured reasoning process: it evaluates the initial assessment, backtracks to consider alternative hypotheses, and compares their merits before arriving at a final classification. Extensive experiments and systematic ablation studies demonstrate that ReasonTSC consistently outperforms both existing time series reasoning baselines and plug-in models, and is even capable of identifying and correcting plug-in models' false predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations.

Moreover, they naturally encode complexity-misfit trade-offs for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) behaviors, providing a principled solution to a longstanding puzzle in behavioral systems theory. The resulting framework characterizes modeling as a minimum distance problem, identifying the Most Powerful Unfalsified Model (MPUM) as optimal among all systems unfalsified by a given dataset.

The dataset includes over 890K records, enriched with points of Interest (POI), socioeconomic indicators, and detailed real estate metrics. To establish standardized performance baselines, we evaluate 14 models, spanning classical statistical approaches, deep neural networks (DNNs), and pretrained time-series foundation models. We further demonstrate the value of HouseTS in a multimodal case study, where a vision language model extracts structured textual descriptions of geographic change from time stamped satellite imagery. This enables interpretable, grounded insights into urban evolution.

To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO.

While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or region-of-interest (ROI) features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 19 figures. v4: ICML 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |

In scenarios lacking extensive data from a target building, foundation models (FMs) represent a promising technology that can leverage prior knowledge from vast and diverse pre-training datasets to construct accurate probabilistic predictors for use in decision-making tools. This paper investigates the applicability and fine-tuning strategies of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) in building energy forecasting. We analyze both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches, particularly low-rank adaptation (LoRA), by using real-world data from a commercial net-zero energy building to capture signals such as room occupancy, carbon emissions, plug loads, and HVAC energy consumption. Our analysis reveals that the zero-shot predictive performance of TSFMs is generally suboptimal. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that employing either full fine-tuning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning significantly enhances forecasting accuracy, even with limited historical data. Notably, fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) substantially reduces computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, fine-tuned TSFMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art deep forecasting models (e.g., temporal fusion transformers) in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across varying building zones and seasonal conditions. These results underline the efficacy of TSFMs for practical, data-constrained building energy management systems, enabling improved decision-making in pursuit of energy efficiency and sustainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version appeared in NeurIPS TSALM Workshop: https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/103019</p></details> |

For bounded variation paths, signature kernels were recently shown to solve a Goursat PDE. However, existing PDE solvers only use increments as input data, leading to first order approximation errors. These approaches become computationally intractable for highly oscillatory input paths, as they have to be resolved at a fine enough scale to accurately recover their signature kernel, resulting in significant time and memory complexities. In this paper, we extend the analysis to rough paths, and show, leveraging the framework of smooth rough paths, that the resulting rough signature kernels can be approximated by a novel system of PDEs whose coefficients involve higher order iterated integrals of the input rough paths. We show that this system of PDEs admits a unique solution and establish quantitative error bounds yielding a higher order approximation to rough signature kernels.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of MR through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework.

Motivated by success of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) methods, we propose a predictability-aware compression-decompression framework to reduce runtime, lower communication cost, and maintain prediction accuracy across diverse predictors. The core idea involves using a circular periodicity key matrix with orthogonality to capture underlying time series predictability during compression and to mitigate reconstruction errors during decompression by relaxing oversimplified data assumptions. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that the proposed framework is both time-efficient and scalable under a large number of channels. Extensive experiments on six datasets across various predictors demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior overall performance by jointly considering prediction accuracy and runtime, while maintaining strong compatibility with diverse predictors.</p></details> | 17 pages,3 figures |

In this paper, a novel imputation framework is proposed using Self-Attention-based Imputation networks for time series, which leverages the power of deep learning and self-attention mechanisms to impute missing data. We further refine the imputed data using a custom made autoencoder, tailored to represent smooth pursuit eye movement sequences. The proposed approach was implemented using 5,504 sequences from 172 Parkinsonian patients and healthy controls. Results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed eye movement sequences with respect to other state of the art techniques, substantially reducing the values for common time domain error metrics such as the mean absolute error, mean relative error, and root mean square error, while also preserving the signal's frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness when large intervals of data are missing. This method offers an alternative solution for robustly handling missing data in time series, enhancing the reliability of smooth pursuit analysis for the screening and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 4 figures.

While LLMs have shown potential in zero-shot forecasting through prompting alone, recent studies suggest that LLMs lack inherent effectiveness in forecasting. Given these conflicting findings, a rigorous validation is essential for drawing reliable conclusions. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs as zero-shot forecasters compared to state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our experiments show that LLM-based zero-shot forecasters often struggle to achieve high accuracy due to their sensitivity to noise, underperforming even simple domain-specific models. We have explored solutions to reduce LLMs' sensitivity to noise in the zero-shot setting, but improving their robustness remains a significant challenge. Our findings suggest that rather than emphasizing zero-shot forecasting, a more promising direction would be to focus on fine-tuning LLMs to better process numerical sequences.

The absence of CID often results in producing identical outputs for identical inputs, disregarding channel-specific characteristics. In this paper, we highlight the importance of CID and propose Channel Normalization (CN), a simple yet effective normalization strategy that enhances CID by assigning distinct affine transformation parameters to each channel. We further extend CN in two ways: 1) Adaptive CN (ACN) dynamically adjusts parameters based on the input TS, improving adaptability in TS models, and 2) Prototypical CN (PCN) introduces a set of learnable prototypes instead of per-channel parameters, enabling applicability to datasets with unknown or varying number of channels and facilitating use in TS foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CN and its variants by applying them to various TS models, achieving significant performance gains for both non-CID and CID models. In addition, we analyze the success of our approach from an information theory perspective. Code is available at https://github.com/seunghan96/CN.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Existing methods for WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction of spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few anomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these issues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both model architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed. In terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network includes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR) module, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network module to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can integrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN neighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data. Moreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce inference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was designed. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series data with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to learn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive learning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the dataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples into few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was developed to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the problem of sample imbalance effectively. In experiments carried out on real public datasets, the designed MTAD-RD anomaly detection method achieved an F1 score of 90.97%, outperforming existing supervised WSN anomaly detection methods.</p></details> |  |

Theoretically, we tackle the challenge of establishing a conditional coverage guarantee for non-exchangeable data under strong mixing conditions on the non-conformity scores. We demonstrate the superior performance of KOWCPI on real and synthetic time-series data against state-of-the-art methods, where KOWCPI achieves narrower confidence intervals without losing coverage.</p></details> |  |

In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a text embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on a well-established time series classification benchmark. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging text embedding models to encode time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

Although Transformer based models have achieved notable performance by implicitly modeling temporal dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, their inherently complex architectures and opaque reasoning processes undermine their trustworthiness in high stakes clinical settings. In response to these limitations, this study shifts focus toward a modeling paradigm that emphasizes structural transparency, aligning more closely with the intrinsic characteristics of medical data. We propose a novel method, Channel Imposed Fusion (CIF), which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio through cross-channel information fusion, effectively reduces redundancy, and improves classification performance. Furthermore, we integrate CIF with the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), known for its structural simplicity and controllable receptive field, to construct an efficient and explicit classification framework. Experimental results on multiple publicly available EEG and ECG datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of various classification metrics, but also significantly enhances the transparency of the classification process, offering a novel perspective for medical time series classification.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods, such as Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), struggle with scalability owing to their quadratic computational complexity. To address this limitation, we introduce WOA-kMedoids, a novel unsupervised clustering method that incorporates the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), a nature-inspired metaheuristic inspired by the hunting strategies of humpback whales. By optimizing the centroid selection, WOA-kMedoids reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to near-linear with respect to the number of observations, enabling scalability to large datasets while maintaining high clustering accuracy. We evaluated WOA-kMedoids using 25 diverse time-series datasets from the UCR archive. Our empirical results show that WOA-kMedoids achieved a clustering performance comparable to PAM, with an average Rand Index (RI) of 0.731 compared to PAM's 0.739, outperforming PAM on 12 out of 25 datasets. While exhibiting a slightly higher runtime than PAM on small datasets (<300 observations), WOA-kMedoids outperformed PAM on larger datasets, with an average speedup of 1.7x and a maximum of 2.3x. The scalability of WOA-kMedoids, combined with its high accuracy, makes them a promising choice for unsupervised clustering in big data applications. This method has implications for efficient knowledge discovery in massive unlabeled datasets, particularly where traditional k-medoids methods are computationally infeasible, including IoT anomaly detection, biomedical signal analysis, and customer behavior clustering.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.</p></details> |  |

While MLP-based mixer models have shown promise in time series analysis, they lack a causality mechanism to preserve temporal dependencies inherent in the system. Moreover, real-world multivariate time series often contain numerous channels with diverse inter-channel correlations. A single embedding mechanism for all channels does not effectively capture these complex relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cluster-aware causal mixer to effectively detect anomalies in multivariate time series. Our model groups channels into clusters based on their correlations, with each cluster processed through a dedicated embedding layer. In addition, we introduce a causal mixer in our model, which mixes the information while maintaining causality. Furthermore, we present an anomaly detection framework that accumulates the anomaly evidence over time to prevent false positives due to nominal outliers. Our proposed model operates in an online fashion, making it suitable for real-time time-series anomaly detection tasks. Experimental evaluations across six public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves superior F1 scores.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most neural architectures flatten these inputs, discarding critical cross-dimension information. We introduce $\textbf{NdLinear}$, a novel linear transformation that circumvents this destructive flattening by operating directly on tensors. NdLinear applies transformations separately along each data dimension, thereby preserving the native data structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate NdLinear's capacity to significantly enhance representational power, achieve dramatic parameter reductions (often by orders of magnitude), and maintain a favorable computational profile. For instance, when applied to Large Language Model finetuning, our $\textbf{NdLinear-LoRA}$ delivers comparable or improved accuracy on reasoning tasks using up to $9\times$ fewer trainable parameters than standard LoRA. These broad advantages of NdLinear are consistently validated across diverse neural architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, MLPs) and data domains, including vision, language, time-series, and tabular tasks. As a versatile, drop-in replacement for standard linear layers, NdLinear processes data in its original N-dimensional form, offering a foundational component for developing more efficient and powerful next-generation neural architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ensemble-core/NdLinear</p></details> |

To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on continuous-valued time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our models are pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving more flexibility in representation learning than using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with one trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse via TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which achieve unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance. In addition to excellent scalability, Sundial achieves state-of-the-art results on both point and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks with a just-in-time inference speed, i.e., making zero-shot predictions within a few milliseconds.

| **[Generating Hypotheses of Dynamic Causal Graphs in Neuroscience: Leveraging Generative Factor Models of Observed Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20697v2)** | 2025-05-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.20697v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.</p></details> |  |

This extension enables the network to differentially weight neighbouring pixels based on their relative position to the reference pixel, improving spatial characterisation and feature extraction. The proposed operator maintains the same number of trainable parameters and is fully compatible with existing CNN architectures. Although developed for 2D image data, the framework is generalisable to signals on regular grids of arbitrary dimensions, such as 3D volumetric data or 1D time series. We propose an efficient implementation of the weighted convolution by pre-computing the density function and achieving execution times comparable to standard convolution layers. We evaluate our method on two deep learning tasks: image classification using the CIFAR-100 dataset [KH+09] and image denoising using the DIV2K dataset [AT17]. Experimental results with state-of-the-art classification (e.g., VGG [SZ15], ResNet [HZRS16]) and denoising (e.g., DnCNN [ZZC+17], NAFNet [CCZS22]) methods show that the weighted convolution improves performance with respect to standard convolution across different quantitative metrics. For example, VGG achieves an accuracy of 66.94% with weighted convolution versus 56.89% with standard convolution on the classification problem, while DnCNN improves the PSNR value from 20.17 to 22.63 on the denoising problem. All models were trained on the CINECA Leonardo cluster to reduce the execution time and improve the tuning of the density function values. The PyTorch implementation of the weighted convolution is publicly available at: https://github.com/cammarasana123/weightedConvolution2.0.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Can Slow-thinking LLMs Reason Over Time? Empirical Studies in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24511v1)** | 2025-05-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.24511v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task, spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations. We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF frameworks.</p></details> |  |

These systems are described as intelligent and there has been a great deal of talk about the rapid increase in artificial intelligence and its potential dangers. However, our theoretical understanding of intelligence and ability to measure it lag far behind our capacity for building systems that mimic intelligent human behaviour. There is no commonly agreed definition of the intelligence that AI systems are said to possess. No-one has developed a practical measure that would enable us to compare the intelligence of humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale. This paper sets out a new universal measure of intelligence that is based on the hypothesis that prediction is the most important component of intelligence. As an agent interacts with its normal environment, the accuracy of its predictions is summed up and the complexity of its predictions and perceived environment is accounted for using Kolmogorov complexity. Two experiments were carried out to evaluate the practical feasibility of the algorithm. These demonstrated that it could measure the intelligence of an agent embodied in a virtual maze and an agent that makes predictions about time-series data. This universal measure could be the starting point for a new comparative science of intelligence that ranks humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale.</p></details> |  |

Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.5 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 59 chemical systems, 9 operating temperatures, and 421 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in various neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, BatteryLife evaluates model performance across aging conditions and domains.

However, in practical deployments, time-series prediction often requires operation in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, which are unable to handle the computational overhead of large models. To address such scenarios, some lightweight models have been proposed, but they exhibit poor performance on non-stationary sequences. In this paper, we propose $\textit{SWIFT}$, a lightweight model that is not only powerful, but also efficient in deployment and inference for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Our model is based on three key points: (i) Utilizing wavelet transform to perform lossless downsampling of time series. (ii) Achieving cross-band information fusion with a learnable filter. (iii) Using only one shared linear layer or one shallow MLP for sub-series' mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that $\textit{SWIFT}$ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, offering a promising method for edge computing and deployment in this task. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the number of parameters in $\textit{SWIFT-Linear}$ is only 25\% of what it would be with a single-layer linear model for time-domain prediction.

| **[$K^2$VAE: A Koopman-Kalman Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23017v2)** | 2025-05-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.23017v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF, providing a more efficient and accurate solution.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts. In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks.

In this work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal time series forecasting research.</p></details> |  |

As the field moves toward multi-modality, Large Vision Models (LVMs) are emerging as a promising direction. In the past, the effectiveness of Transformer and LLMs in time series has been debated. When it comes to LVMs, a similar question arises: are LVMs truely useful for time series analysis? To address it, we design and conduct the first principled study involving 4 LVMs, 8 imaging methods, 18 datasets and 26 baselines across both high-level (classification) and low-level (forecasting) tasks, with extensive ablation analysis. Our findings indicate LVMs are indeed useful for time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. Although effective, the contemporary best LVM forecasters are limited to specific types of LVMs and imaging methods, exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods, and have limited ability to utilize long look-back windows. We hope our findings could serve as a cornerstone for future research on LVM- and multimodal-based solutions to different time series tasks.</p></details> |  |

These MMVs can reveal complementary patterns and enable the use of powerful pre-trained large models, such as large vision models (LVMs), for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). However, as we identified in this work, applying LVMs to LTSF poses an inductive bias towards "forecasting periods". To harness this bias, we propose DMMV, a novel decomposition-based multi-modal view framework that leverages trend-seasonal decomposition and a novel backcast residual based adaptive decomposition to integrate MMVs for LTSF. Comparative evaluations against 14 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across diverse datasets show that DMMV outperforms single-view and existing multi-modal baselines, achieving the best mean squared error (MSE) on 6 out of 8 benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

Discrete token-based approaches are limited in numeric representation capacity while methods like neural ordinary differential equations are not well suited for categorical data or informative sampling and require augmentation to handle certain classes of trajectories. Here, we present multivariateGPT, a single architecture for modeling sequences of mixed categorical (including tokenized text) and numeric data. This is accomplished with an autoregressive sequence decomposition, embedding scheme, and loss function that extend the next token prediction task to likelihood estimation of the joint distribution of next token class and value. We demonstrate how this approach can efficiently learn to generalize patterns in simple physical systems and model complex time series including electrocardiograms and multivariate electronic health record data. This work extends the utility of transformer based models to additional classes of data.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

While anecdotally known, this paper provides empirical evidence regarding generative AI's association with malicious internet-related activities and cybercrime by examining the phenomenon through psychological frameworks of technological amplification and affordance theory. Using a quasi-experimental design with interrupted time series analysis, we analyze two datasets, one general and one cryptocurrency-focused, to empirically assess generative AI's role in cybercrime. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions about AI governance by balancing control and fostering innovation, underscoring the need for strategies to guide policymakers, inform AI developers and cybersecurity professionals, and educate the public to maximize AI's benefits while mitigating its risks.</p></details> |  |

This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS (Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce) across both short- and long-term forecasts.</p></details> |  |

This was possible through a preliminary a posteriori explainable phase describing the numerical input data in terms of concurrent constituents with numerical payloads. This further required extending the event-based literature to design specification mining algorithms supporting concurrent constituents. Our previous and current solutions outperform state-of-the-art solutions for multivariate time series classifications, thus showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |

While recent methods have achieved remarkable accuracy by incorporating advanced inductive biases and training strategies, we observe that instance-level variations remain a significant challenge. These variations--stemming from distribution shifts, missing data, and long-tail patterns--often lead to suboptimal forecasts for specific instances, even when overall performance appears strong. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework, PIR, designed to enhance forecasting performance through Post-forecasting Identification and Revision. Specifically, PIR first identifies biased forecasting instances by estimating their accuracy. Based on this, the framework revises the forecasts using contextual information, including covariates and historical time series, from both local and global perspectives in a post-processing fashion. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with mainstream forecasting models demonstrate that PIR effectively mitigates instance-level errors and significantly improves forecasting reliability.</p></details> |  |

Accurately retrieving existing information and discovering new insights from this extensive literature is essential for advancing the field. However, when knowledge is dispersed across multiple sources, current state-of-the-art retrieval methods often struggle to extract the necessary information. A knowledge graph (KG) can integrate and link knowledge from multiple sources, but existing methods for constructing KGs in neuroscience often rely on labeled data and require domain expertise. Acquiring large-scale, labeled data for a specialized area like neuroscience presents significant challenges. This work proposes novel methods for constructing KG from unlabeled large-scale neuroscience research corpus utilizing large language models (LLM), neuroscience ontology, and text embeddings. We analyze the semantic relevance of neuroscience text segments identified by LLM for building the knowledge graph. We also introduce an entity-augmented information retrieval algorithm to extract knowledge from the KG. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed approaches, and the results demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance knowledge discovery from the unlabeled neuroscience research corpus. It achieves an F1 score of 0.84 for entity extraction, and the knowledge obtained from the KG improves answers to over 54% of the questions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SVGenius, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,377 queries across three progressive dimensions: understanding, editing, and generation. Built on real-world data from 24 application domains with systematic complexity stratification, SVGenius evaluates models through 8 task categories and 18 metrics. We assess 22 mainstream models spanning different scales, architectures, training paradigms, and accessibility levels. Our analysis reveals that while proprietary models significantly outperform open-source counterparts, all models exhibit systematic performance degradation with increasing complexity, indicating fundamental limitations in current approaches; however, reasoning-enhanced training proves more effective than pure scaling for overcoming these limitations, though style transfer remains the most challenging capability across all model types. SVGenius establishes the first systematic evaluation framework for SVG processing, providing crucial insights for developing more capable vector graphics models and advancing automated graphic design applications.

However, the vast design search space and strict constraint adherence make efficient synthesis challenging. Leveraging the versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose AUTOCIRCUIT-RL,a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for automated analog circuit synthesis. The framework operates in two phases: instruction tuning, where an LLM learns to generate circuit topologies from structured prompts encoding design constraints, and RL refinement, which further improves the instruction-tuned model using reward models that evaluate validity, efficiency, and output voltage. The refined model is then used directly to generate topologies that satisfy the design constraints. Empirical results show that AUTOCIRCUIT-RL generates ~12% more valid circuits and improves efficiency by ~14% compared to the best baselines, while reducing duplicate generation rates by ~38%. It achieves over 60% success in synthesizing valid circuits with limited training data, demonstrating strong generalization. These findings highlight the framework's effectiveness in scaling to complex circuits while maintaining efficiency and constraint adherence, marking a significant advancement in AI-driven circuit design.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages (Content), 4 Pages (Appendix), 7 figures, ICML'2025</p></details> |

Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%, respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that incorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals two critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not always guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses do not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.</p></details> | 38 pages |

CUA have made significant progress with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, these agents typically rely on cloud-based inference with substantial compute demands, raising critical privacy and scalability concerns, especially when operating on personal devices. In this work, we take a step toward privacy-preserving and resource-efficient agents by developing a lightweight vision-language model that runs entirely on local machines. To train this compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation. Experiments on the OS-World benchmark demonstrate that our fine-tuned local model outperforms existing baselines, highlighting a promising path toward private, efficient, and generalizable GUI agents.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Privacy-preserving Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts (PC-MoE), which leverages the sparsity of the MoE architecture for memory-efficient decentralized collaborative LLM training, enabling multiple parties with limited GPU-memory and data resources to collectively train more capable LLMs than they could achieve individually. At the same time, this approach protects training data privacy of each participant by keeping training data, as well as parts of the forward pass signal and gradients locally within each party. By design, PC-MoE synergistically combines the strengths of distributed computation with strong confidentiality assurances. Unlike most privacy-preserving schemes, which pay for confidentiality with lower task accuracy, our framework breaks that trade-off: across seven popular LLM benchmarks, it almost matches (and sometimes exceeds) the performance and convergence rate of a fully centralized model, enjoys near 70% peak GPU RAM reduction, while being fully robust against reconstruction attacks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures, |

While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, \textit{mutation score} offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100\% coverage but only 4\% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies often rely on brute-force optimization or manual design, failing to uncover potential risks in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, inspired by heuristics and biases in human cognition. Leveraging the simplicity effect, we employ cognitive decomposition to reduce the complexity of malicious prompts. Simultaneously, relevance bias is utilized to reorganize prompts, enhancing semantic alignment and inducing harmful outputs effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric that surpasses the traditional binary success-or-failure paradigm by employing ranking aggregation methods such as Elo, HodgeRank, and Rank Centrality to comprehensively quantify the harmfulness of generated content. Experimental results show that our approach consistently bypasses mainstream LLMs' safety mechanisms and generates high-risk content, providing insights into jailbreak attack risks and contributing to stronger defense strategies.</p></details> |  |

We propose quantitative LLM judges, which align evaluation scores of existing LLM judges to human scores in a given domain using regression models. The models are trained to improve the score of the original judge by using the judge's textual evaluation and score. We present four quantitative judges for different types of absolute and relative feedback, which showcases the generality and versatility of our framework. Our framework is more computationally efficient than supervised fine-tuning and can be more statistically efficient when human feedback is limited, which is expected in most applications of our work. We validate these claims empirically on four datasets using two base judges. Our experiments show that quantitative judges can effectively improve the predictive power of existing judges through post-hoc modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, writing unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to generate tests that achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions. However, existing LLM-based methods often require LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM framework for automated JUnit test generation. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality test prefixes and accurate oracles. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that CANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in generating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving improvements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in improving test prefix quality and oracle accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, mobile devices perform low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on only a subset of lower layers of the pre-trained LLM, tailored to their individual capacities. On the server, a full LLM is maintained, and the corresponding LoRA modules are selectively fine-tuned in a sequential manner for each device. To further enhance training efficiency, we propose a server-side training scheduling method that optimizes the processing order of devices for accelerating fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to the baselines, our scheme can reduce 79\% memory footprint and 6\% training time while achieving comparable performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE INFOCOM IEILM 2025</p></details> |

We propose dynamics modelling (DyMo), a method that augments LLMs with a state prediction capability alongside function calling during post-training. This enables LLMs to predict the future states of their actions through an internal environment model. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2, DyMo improves success rates and significantly reduces hallucinations. We further integrate the internal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS), and show that this substantially improves pass^k over number of trials k, and allows the model to refuse unreliable outputs. Together, DyMo and SVS greatly enhance the effectiveness and reliability of LLMs for tool use. We believe this work charts a path towards scalable planning RL methods for LLM inference without repeatedly querying the oracle environment.</p></details> |  |

Although recent foundation models automate this process, they typically annotate cells independently, without considering batch-level cellular context or providing explanatory reasoning. In contrast, human experts often annotate distinct cell types for different cell clusters based on their domain knowledge. To mimic this workflow, we introduce the CellPuzzles task, where the objective is to assign unique cell types to a batch of cells. This benchmark spans diverse tissues, diseases, and donor conditions, and requires reasoning across the batch-level cellular context to ensure label uniqueness. We find that off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) struggle on CellPuzzles, with the best baseline (OpenAI's o1) achieving only 19.0% batch-level accuracy. To fill this gap, we propose Cell-o1, a 7B LLM trained via supervised fine-tuning on distilled reasoning traces, followed by reinforcement learning with batch-level rewards. Cell-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming o1 by over 73% and generalizing well across contexts.

Unlike prior methods that treat labels as flat and independent, our approach leverages LLM prompting to automatically generate multi-level semantic taxonomies and introduces a recursive uncertainty projection mechanism that propagates uncertainty across hierarchy levels. This enables spatially diverse, label-aware point selection that respects the inherent semantic structure of 3D scenes. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 show that our method achieves up to 4% mIoU improvement under extremely low annotation budgets (e.g., 0.02%), substantially outperforming existing baselines. Our results highlight the untapped potential of LLMs as knowledge priors in 3D vision and establish hierarchical uncertainty modeling as a powerful paradigm for efficient point cloud annotation.</p></details> |  |

Exploring jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs' vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs a simple assistive task such as a masked language model task or an element lookup by position task to encode the semantics of the masked keywords. Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform the jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on AdvBench dataset, with mask language model (MLM) assistive task, SATA achieves an overall attack success rate (ASR) of 85% and harmful score (HS) of 4.57, and with element lookup by position (ELP) assistive task, SATA attains an overall ASR of 76% and HS of 4.43.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability, measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly ``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails. Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior. Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.

To overcome this issue, we utilize the fact that LLM output is invariant under certain orthogonal transformations of weight matrices. This insight can be leveraged to identify transformations that significantly improve the compressibility of weights within structured classes.

While increasing parameter counts improves accuracy, it also broadens the gap between state-of-the-art capabilities and practical deployability. We present Puzzle, a hardware-aware framework that accelerates the inference of LLMs while preserving their capabilities. Using neural architecture search (NAS) at a large-scale, Puzzle optimizes models with tens of billions of parameters. Our approach utilizes blockwise local knowledge distillation (BLD) for parallel architecture exploration and employs mixed-integer programming for precise constraint optimization. We showcase our framework's impact via Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct (Nemotron-51B) and Llama-3.3-Nemotron-49B, two publicly available models derived from Llama-70B-Instruct. Both models achieve a 2.17x inference throughput speedup, fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU while retaining 98.4% of the original model's benchmark accuracies. These are the most accurate models supporting single H100 GPU inference with large batch sizes, despite training on 45B tokens at most, far fewer than the 15T used to train Llama-70B. Lastly, we show that lightweight alignment on these derived models allows them to surpass the parent model in specific capabilities. Our work establishes that powerful LLM models can be optimized for efficient deployment with only negligible loss in quality, underscoring that inference performance, not parameter count alone, should guide model selection.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose SubTrack++ that leverages Grassmannian gradient subspace tracking combined with projection-aware optimizers, enabling Adam's internal statistics to adapt to changes in the optimization subspace. Additionally, employing recovery scaling, a technique that restores information lost through low-rank projections, further enhances model performance.

PUE is trained utilizing an LLM-TTS architecture to ensure emotional consistency between categorical emotion-relevant prompts and emotional speech, allowing the model to quantitatively capture different emotion weightings per utterance. During inference, mixed emotional speech can be generated by flexibly adjusting emotion proportions and leveraging LLM contextual knowledge, enabling the model to quantify different emotional styles.

Multi-agent systems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution, enabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning. However, optimizing these systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and limited adaptability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent policies based on system-level feedback. Nevertheless, existing MARL algorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on Critic networks, which can cause training instability and increase computational burden. To address these limitations and target the prototypical Multi-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group Policy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy updates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of rollouts. MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability and reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three group rollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate that MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and computational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential for stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.</p></details> |  |

Both are crucial to creating an enjoyable interactive experience, while they have been underexplored in previous work. To enhance these two aspects, we first propose Playwriting-guided Generation, a novel method that helps LLMs craft dramatic stories with substantially improved structures and narrative quality.

We study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity, and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into reliable evaluations. lmgame-Bench features a suite of platformer, puzzle, and narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation analysis shows that every game probes a unique blend of capabilities often tested in isolation elsewhere. More interestingly, performing reinforcement learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and to external planning tasks. Our evaluation code is available at https://github.com/lmgame-org/GamingAgent/lmgame-bench.</p></details> |  |

A widely adopted strategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the model's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers. However, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely reflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice. As bias accumulates through the model's layers, the final output can diverge from the underlying reasoning process, making output-level confidence an unreliable signal for hallucination detection. In this work, we propose Sample-Specific Prompting (SSP), a new framework that improves self-assessment by analyzing perturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations. These representations, being less influenced by model bias, offer a more faithful view of the model's latent reasoning process. Specifically, SSP dynamically generates noise prompts for each input and employs a lightweight encoder to amplify the changes in representations caused by the perturbation. A contrastive distance metric is then used to quantify these differences and separate truthful from hallucinated responses. By leveraging the dynamic behavior of intermediate representations under perturbation, SSP enables more reliable self-assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSP significantly outperforms prior methods across a range of hallucination detection benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the challenge of performing efficient language reasoning--especially during inference with extremely long outputs--has drawn increasing attention from the research community. In this work, we propose a dynamic ratio-based training pipeline that does not rely on sophisticated data annotations or interpolation between multiple models. We continuously balance the weights between the model's System-1 and System-2 data to eliminate redundant reasoning processes while preserving the model's reasoning capability. We validate our approach across models on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-14B and on a diverse set of benchmarks with varying difficulty levels. Our method significantly reduces the number of output tokens by nearly 40% while maintaining the accuracy of the reasoning. Our code and data will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

We propose the GPTVQ method, a new fast method for post-training vector quantization (VQ) that scales well to Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method interleaves quantization of one or more columns with updates to the remaining unquantized weights, using information from the Hessian of the per-layer output reconstruction MSE. Quantization codebooks are initialized using an efficient data-aware version of the EM algorithm. The codebooks are then updated, and further compressed by using integer quantization and SVD-based compression. GPTVQ establishes a new state-of-the art in the size vs accuracy trade-offs on a wide range of LLMs such as Llama-v2 and Mistral. Furthermore, our method is efficient: on a single H100 it takes between 3 and 11 hours to process a Llamav2-70B model, depending on quantization setting. Lastly, with on-device timings for VQ decompression on a mobile CPU we show that VQ leads to improved latency compared to using a 4-bit integer format.</p></details> |  |

EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into 182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.</p></details> | 47 pages, 24 figures |

Analyzing Consistency in Persona-Assigned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02659v1)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.02659v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in diverse applications, where they are assigned a specific persona - such as a happy high school teacher - to guide their responses. While prior research has examined how well LLMs adhere to predefined personas in writing style, a comprehensive analysis of consistency across different personas and task types is lacking. In this paper, we introduce a new standardized framework to analyze consistency in persona-assigned LLMs. We define consistency as the extent to which a model maintains coherent responses when assigned the same persona across different tasks and runs. Our framework evaluates personas across four different categories (happiness, occupation, personality, and political stance) spanning multiple task dimensions (survey writing, essay generation, social media post generation, single turn, and multi-turn conversations). Our findings reveal that consistency is influenced by multiple factors, including the assigned persona, stereotypes, and model design choices. Consistency also varies across tasks, increasing with more structured tasks and additional context. All code is available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose EoRA, a novel fine-tuning-free method that augments compressed LLMs with low-rank matrices, allowing users to rapidly enhance task-specific performance and freely balance the trade-off between accuracy and computational overhead beyond the constraints of compression formats. EoRA consistently outperforms prior training-free low rank methods in recovering the accuracy of compressed LLMs, achieving notable accuracy improvements (e.g., $\mathbf{10.84\%}$ on ARC-Challenge, $\mathbf{6.74\%}$ on MathQA, and $\mathbf{6.74\%}$ on GSM8K) for LLaMA3-8B compressed to 3-bit. We also introduce an optimized CUDA kernel, accelerating inference by up to 1.4x and reducing memory overhead through quantizing EoRA. Overall, EoRA offers a prompt solution for improving the accuracy of compressed models under varying user requirements, enabling more efficient and flexible deployment of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/EoRA.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, motivated by human behaviour, we introduce a generalizable and explicit paradigm for uncovering interactive patterns of LLMs across diverse worldviews. Specifically, we first define interactive hallucination through stance transfer, then construct SHARP, a benchmark built by extracting relations from commonsense knowledge graphs and utilizing LLMs' inherent hallucination properties to simulate multi-role interactions. Extensive experiments confirm our paradigm's effectiveness and stability, examine the factors that influence these metrics, and challenge conventional hallucination mitigation solutions. More broadly, our work reveals a fundamental limitation in popular post-training methods for role-playing LLMs: the tendency to obscure knowledge beneath style, resulting in monotonous yet human-like behaviors - interactive hallucination.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, unfortunately accepted to findings with Meta 4, acknowledge and apologize to the reviewers and area chair who support our work in the discussion period</p></details> |

Using a range of dimension reduction and pattern recognition methods, we first identify the model layers that show the greatest divergence in encoding these representations. We then analyze the activations within a selected layer to examine how specific personas are encoded relative to others, including their shared and distinct embedding spaces. We find that, across multiple pre-trained decoder-only LLMs, the analyzed personas show large differences in representation space only within the final third of the decoder layers. We observe overlapping activations for specific ethical perspectives -- such as moral nihilism and utilitarianism -- suggesting a degree of polysemy. In contrast, political ideologies like conservatism and liberalism appear to be represented in more distinct regions. These findings help to improve our understanding of how LLMs internally represent information and can inform future efforts in refining the modulation of specific human traits in LLM outputs.

Notably, unnatural languages possess latent features that can be generalized across different models and tasks during inference. Furthermore, models fine-tuned on unnatural versions of instruction datasets perform on-par with those trained on natural language, achieving 49.71 win rates in Length-controlled AlpacaEval 2.0 in average across various base models. In addition, through comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs process unnatural languages by filtering noise and inferring contextual meaning from filtered words.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically measure this bias by calculating the difference between the scores a judge model assigns to its own responses and those it assigns to responses from other models. However, this approach conflates self-preference bias with response quality, as higher-quality responses from the judge model may also lead to positive score differences, even in the absence of bias. To address this issue, we introduce gold judgments as proxies for the actual quality of responses and propose the DBG score, which measures self-preference bias as the difference between the scores assigned by the judge model to its own responses and the corresponding gold judgments. Since gold judgments reflect true response quality, the DBG score mitigates the confounding effect of response quality on bias measurement. Using the DBG score, we conduct comprehensive experiments to assess self-preference bias across LLMs of varying versions, sizes, and reasoning abilities. Additionally, we investigate two factors that influence and help alleviate self-preference bias: response text style and the post-training data of judge models. Finally, we explore potential underlying mechanisms of self-preference bias from an attention-based perspective. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zhiyuanc2001/self-preference.</p></details> |  |

Being available to users from diverse cultural backgrounds, large language models (LLMs) should also be able to provide accurate information irrespective of the measurement system at hand. Using newly compiled datasets we test if this is the case for seven open-source LLMs, addressing three key research questions: (RQ1) What is the default system used by LLMs for each type of measurement? (RQ2) Do LLMs' answers and their accuracy vary across different measurement systems? (RQ3) Can LLMs mitigate potential challenges w.r.t. underrepresented systems via reasoning? Our findings show that LLMs default to the measurement system predominantly used in the data. Additionally, we observe considerable instability and variance in performance across different measurement systems. While this instability can in part be mitigated by employing reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought (CoT), this implies longer responses and thereby significantly increases test-time compute (and inference costs), marginalizing users from cultural backgrounds that use underrepresented measurement systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main (Camera-Ready Version)</p></details> |

The study utilizes the unique SPbLitGuide dataset, a collection of event announcements from Saint Petersburg spanning 1999 to 2019. A comparative evaluation of diverse NER models is presented, encompassing established transformer-based architectures such as DeepPavlov, RoBERTa, and SpaCy, alongside recent Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o. Key findings highlight the superior performance of GPT-4o when provided with specific prompting for JSON output, achieving an F1 score of 0.93.

In this work, we present IndoSafety, the first high-quality, human-verified safety evaluation dataset tailored for the Indonesian context, covering five language varieties: formal and colloquial Indonesian, along with three major local languages: Javanese, Sundanese, and Minangkabau. IndoSafety is constructed by extending prior safety frameworks to develop a taxonomy that captures Indonesia's sociocultural context. We find that existing Indonesian-centric LLMs often generate unsafe outputs, particularly in colloquial and local language settings, while fine-tuning on IndoSafety significantly improves safety while preserving task performance.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in single-robot settings, but their application in multi-robot systems remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel LLM-Aided MARL (LAMARL) approach, which integrates MARL with LLMs, significantly enhancing sample efficiency without requiring manual design. LAMARL consists of two modules: the first module leverages LLMs to fully automate the generation of prior policy and reward functions. The second module is MARL, which uses the generated functions to guide robot policy training effectively. On a shape assembly benchmark, both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the unique advantages of LAMARL. Ablation studies show that the prior policy improves sample efficiency by an average of 185.9% and enhances task completion, while structured prompts based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and basic APIs improve LLM output success rates by 28.5%-67.5%.

To facilitate effective self-correction, recent research has proposed mistake detection as its initial step. However, current literature suggests that LLMs often struggle with reliably identifying reasoning mistakes when using simplistic prompting strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce a unique prompting strategy, termed the Pedagogical Chain-of-Thought (PedCoT), which is specifically designed to guide the identification of reasoning mistakes, particularly mathematical reasoning mistakes. PedCoT consists of pedagogical principles for prompts (PPP) design, two-stage interaction process (TIP) and grounded PedCoT prompts, all inspired by the educational theory of the Bloom Cognitive Model (BCM). We evaluate our approach on two public datasets featuring math problems of varying difficulty levels. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prompting strategy significantly outperforms strong baselines. The proposed method can achieve the goal of reliable mathematical mistake identification and provide a foundation for automatic math answer grading. The results underscore the significance of educational theory, serving as domain knowledge, in guiding prompting strategy design for addressing challenging tasks with LLMs effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

This assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not, for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency, and holds promise for broad applicability.</p></details> |  |

This vulnerability stems from a fundamental gap: LLM agents treat all incoming messages equally without evaluating their trustworthiness. While some existing studies approach the trustworthiness, they focus on a single type of harmfulness rather than analyze it in a holistic approach from multiple trustworthiness perspectives. In this work, we propose Attention Trust Score (A-Trust), a lightweight, attention-based method for evaluating message trustworthiness. Inspired by human communication literature[1], through systematically analyzing attention behaviors across six orthogonal trust dimensions, we find that certain attention heads in the LLM specialize in detecting specific types of violations. Leveraging these insights, A-Trust directly infers trustworthiness from internal attention patterns without requiring external prompts or verifiers. Building upon A-Trust, we develop a principled and efficient trust management system (TMS) for LLM-MAS, enabling both message-level and agent-level trust assessment. Experiments across diverse multi-agent settings and tasks demonstrate that applying our TMS significantly enhances robustness against malicious inputs.</p></details> |  |

Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully.

Nevertheless, for large-scale industrial decision problems, both approaches face distinct challenges: LLMs lack real-time long-sequence decision-making capabilities, while RL struggles with sample efficiency in vast action spaces. To bridge this gap, we propose Agents Co-Evolution (ACE), a synergistic framework between LLMs and RL agents for large-scale decision-making scenarios. ACE introduces a dual-role trajectory refinement mechanism where LLMs act as both Policy Actor and Value Critic during RL's training: the Actor refines suboptimal actions via multi-step reasoning and environment validation, while the Critic performs temporal credit assignment through trajectory-level reward shaping.

Prior works have utilized this capability to improve smaller and cheaper LMs (say, with 7B parameters). However, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues, owing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed) models, prevent their use in commercial settings. Little focus has been given to improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling information from larger LLMs. To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable framework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of diverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task. COLLATE enforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and employs them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs. The LLM is then tuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which maximizes the likelihood of ground-truth answer. COLLATE outperforms several trainable and prompting baselines on 5 datasets across 3 domains: maths problem solving, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. We show the eff icacy of COLLATE on LLMs from different model families across varying parameter scales (1B to 8B) and demonstrate the benefit of multiple rationale providers guided by the end task through ablations.

Limited work has been done examining the effect of embodiment on the perception of CAs utilizing modern large language models (LLMs) in non-hierarchical cooperative tasks, a common use case of CAs as more powerful models become widely available for general use. To bridge this research gap, we conducted a mixed-methods within-subjects study on how users perceive LLM-based CAs in cooperative tasks when embodied and non-embodied. The results show that the non-embodied agent received significantly better quantitative appraisals for competence than the embodied agent, and in qualitative feedback, many participants believed that the embodied CA was more sycophantic than the non-embodied CA. Building on prior work on users' perceptions of LLM sycophancy and anthropomorphic features, we theorize that the typically-positive impact of embodiment on perception of CA credibility can become detrimental in the presence of sycophancy. The implication of such a phenomenon is that, contrary to intuition and existing literature, embodiment is not a straightforward way to improve a CA's perceived credibility if there exists a tendency to sycophancy.</p></details> |  |

A recent work introduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first demonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian distributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1) GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2) DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy. Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard training baselines. By grounding LLM development in principled statistical modeling, this work forges a new path toward efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware AI systems.

Nevertheless, maintaining state consistency presents significant challenges due to unexpected failures, network disruptions, and asynchronous issues, especially within dynamic cloud environments. These challenges result in operational disruptions and economic losses, underscoring the necessity for robust root cause analysis (RCA) to enhance Kubernetes reliability. The development of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising direction for RCA. However, existing methodologies encounter several obstacles, including the diverse and evolving nature of Kubernetes incidents, the intricate context of incidents, and the polymorphic nature of these incidents. In this paper, we introduce SynergyRCA, an innovative tool that leverages LLMs with retrieval augmentation from graph databases and enhancement with expert prompts. SynergyRCA constructs a StateGraph to capture spatial and temporal relationships and utilizes a MetaGraph to outline entity connections. Upon the occurrence of an incident, an LLM predicts the most pertinent resource, and SynergyRCA queries the MetaGraph and StateGraph to deliver context-specific insights for RCA. We evaluate SynergyRCA using datasets from two production Kubernetes clusters, highlighting its capacity to identify numerous root causes, including novel ones, with high efficiency and precision. SynergyRCA demonstrates the ability to identify root causes in an average time of about two minutes and achieves an impressive precision of approximately 0.90.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Through various experiments, we demonstrate that: (1) Our proposed methodology exhibits the capacity to augment pretraining, presenting an opportunity akin to obtaining substantial benefits at minimal cost; (2) Our proposed methodology, despite requiring a given held-out dataset, still demonstrates robust generalization capabilities across diverse domains, a pivotal aspect in pretraining.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

Meanwhile, existing methods typically target isolated temporal skills, such as question answering about past events or basic forecasting, and exhibit poor generalization, particularly when dealing with events beyond their knowledge cutoff or requiring creative foresight. To address these limitations, we introduce \textit{Time-R1}, the first framework to endow a moderate-sized (3B-parameter) LLM with comprehensive temporal abilities: understanding, prediction, and creative generation. Our approach features a novel three-stage development path; the first two constitute a \textit{reinforcement learning (RL) curriculum} driven by a meticulously designed dynamic rule-based reward system. This framework progressively builds (1) foundational temporal understanding and logical event-time mappings from historical data, (2) future event prediction skills for events beyond its knowledge cutoff, and finally (3) enables remarkable generalization to creative future scenario generation without any fine-tuning. Strikingly, experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 outperforms models over 200 times larger, including the state-of-the-art 671B DeepSeek-R1, on highly challenging future event prediction and creative scenario generation benchmarks. This work provides strong evidence that thoughtfully engineered, progressive RL fine-tuning allows smaller, efficient models to achieve superior temporal performance, offering a practical and scalable path towards truly time-aware AI. To foster further research, we also release \textit{Time-Bench}, a large-scale multi-task temporal reasoning dataset derived from 10 years of news data, and our series of \textit{Time-R1} checkpoints.</p></details> |  |

Previous evaluation focused on the speech-understanding ability, lacking a quantification of acoustic quality. In this paper, we propose Speech cOnversational Voice Assistant Benchmark (SOVA-Bench), providing a comprehension comparison of the general knowledge, speech recognition and understanding, along with both semantic and acoustic generative ability between available speech LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, SOVA-Bench is one of the most systematic evaluation frameworks for speech LLMs, inspiring the direction of voice interaction systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a two-dimensional framework for assessing LLM safety: (1) instruction refusal-the ability to reject harmful obfuscated instructions, and (2) generation safety-the suppression of generating harmful responses. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that models that possess capabilities to decrypt ciphers may be susceptible to mismatched-generalization attacks: their safety mechanisms fail on at least one safety dimension, leading to unsafe responses or over-refusal. Based on these findings, we evaluate a number of pre-LLM and post-LLM safeguards and discuss their strengths and limitations. This work contributes to understanding the safety of LLM in long-tail text scenarios and provides directions for developing robust safety mechanisms.</p></details> | Preprint |

A core challenge in employing RLHF lies in training a reliable reward model (RM), which relies on high-quality labels typically provided by human experts or advanced AI system. These methods can be costly and may introduce biases that affect the language model's responses. As language models improve, human input may become less effective in further enhancing their performance. In this paper, we propose Self-Evolved Reward Learning (SER), a novel approach where the RM generates additional training data to iteratively improve itself. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple datasets such as HH-RLHF and UltraFeedback, using models like Mistral and Llama 3, and compare SER against various baselines. Our results demonstrate that even with limited human-annotated data, learning from self-feedback can robustly enhance RM performance, thereby boosting the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

This limitation makes it challenging to detect misinformation and ensure reliable decision-making. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs are primarily prompt-wise rather than response-wise, often requiring multiple response samples, which incurs high computational costs. Moreover, LLMs have been shown to be overconfident, particularly when using reasoning steps to derive their answers. In this work, we propose CoT-UQ, a response-wise UQ framework that integrates LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the UQ process. CoT-UQ captures critical information during inference by extracting keywords from each reasoning step and assessing their importance to the final answer. This key reasoning information is then aggregated to produce a final uncertainty estimate. We conduct extensive experiments based on Llama Family with model sizes varying from 8B to 13B across logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-UQ significantly outperforms existing UQ methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.9% AUROC compared to current UQ methods.

Current detection methods often resort to external knowledge, LLM fine-tuning, or supervised training with large hallucination-labeled datasets. Moreover, these approaches do not distinguish between different types of hallucinations, which is crucial for enhancing detection performance. To address such limitations, we introduce hallucination probing, a new task that classifies LLM-generated text into three categories: aligned, misaligned, and fabricated. Driven by our novel discovery that perturbing key entities in prompts affects LLM's generation of these three types of text differently, we propose SHINE, a novel hallucination probing method that does not require external knowledge, supervised training, or LLM fine-tuning. SHINE is effective in hallucination probing across three modern LLMs, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in hallucination detection, outperforming seven competing methods across four datasets and four LLMs, underscoring the importance of probing for accurate detection.</p></details> | 22 pages, 15 figures |

Building upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3) recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test 3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors, highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings.

Designing high-quality heuristic algorithms that efficiently approximate optimal solutions within reasonable time is a critical research challenge. In recent years, many works have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Evolutionary Algorithms to automate heuristic algorithm design through prompt engineering. However, these approaches generally adopt a problem-specific paradigm, applying a single algorithm across all problem instances, failing to account for the heterogeneity across instances. In this paper, we propose InstSpecHH, a novel framework that introduces the concept of instance-specific heuristic generation. InstSpecHH partitions the overall problem class into sub-classes based on instance features and performs differentiated, automated heuristic design for each problem subclass. By tailoring heuristics to the unique features of different sub-classes, InstSpecHH achieves better performance at the problem class level while avoiding redundant heuristic generation for similar instances, thus reducing computational overhead. This approach effectively balances the trade-off between the cost of automatic heuristic design and the quality of the obtained solutions. To evaluate the performance of InstSpecHH, we conduct experiments on 4,500 subclasses of the Online Bin Packing Problem (OBPP) and 365 subclasses of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Experimental results show that InstSpecHH demonstrates strong intra-subclass and inter-subclass generalization capabilities. Compared to previous problem-specific methods, InstSpecHH reduces the average optimality gap by more than 5.6\% for OBPP and 0.9\% for CVRP. These results highlight the potential of instance-aware automatic heuristic design to further enhance solution quality.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences. Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.</p></details> |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex, inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical exam questions. The benchmark will be released at the homepage.</p></details> |  |

Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).</p></details> | 25 pages |

However, existing personalization approaches often fail to distinguish which components of model predictions and training data truly reflect user preferences, leading to superficial personalization alignment. In this paper, we introduce NextQuill, a novel LLM personalization alignment framework grounded in causal preference modeling. We approach personalization from a causal perspective, treating both model predictions and ground-truth data generation as outcomes influenced by user preferences, along with other factors. We define the true preference effect as the causal impact of user history (which reflects preferences) on each token prediction or data generation instance, estimated through causal intervention techniques. Building on this insight, NextQuill introduces two complementary alignment strategies: (1) aligning model-internal causal preference effects on predictions with those reflected in ground-truth data, rather than indiscriminately fitting predictions, and (2) focusing on fitting preference-bearing tokens identified via ground-truth data preference effects, rather than treating all tokens uniformly. By integrating these strategies, NextQuill shifts the alignment process toward learning from causal preference effects, facilitating more effective and personalized adaptation.

A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. Failure to prioritize such principles indicates a potential basic control failure. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark methodology using a simple grid world to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a predefined, high-level safety principle (e.g., "never enter hazardous zones") when faced with conflicting lower-level task instructions. We probe whether the agent reliably prioritizes the inviolable directive, testing a foundational controllability aspect of LLMs. This pilot study demonstrates the methodology's feasibility, offers preliminary insights into agent behavior under principle conflict, and discusses how such benchmarks can contribute empirical evidence for assessing controllability. We argue that evaluating adherence to hierarchical principles is a crucial early step in understanding our capacity to build governable AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Manual curation remains the gold standard but is resource-intensive and not scalable. We introduce DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight summarization that integrates structured sports analytics with natural language reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9% (WPA-only) to 84.8%, outperforming both commercial and statistical baselines.

While prior works show that LRMs' capabilities can be reproduced through direct distillation, the continued reliance on the existing models (e.g., R1) remains a critical limitation in advancing the field. As a first step toward independent LRM development, this paper explores the possibility of constructing a long CoT dataset with LLMs that are not trained for inference-time scaling. To this end, we present the Long CoT Collection, a dataset of 100K CoT rationales annotated using existing short CoT LLMs. We develop a pipeline that induces o1's novel reasoning strategies into short CoT LLMs, enabling them to think longer and introducing controllability over the thought budget to better manage the overthinking problem. Our extensive analyses validate that our dataset achieves quality comparable to--or slightly below--R1. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that training on our dataset not only strengthens general reasoning skills, but also provides a strong foundation for reinforcement learning--models initialized on our data achieve 2-3x larger gains with RLVR.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Industry |

However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be accessed at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA</p></details> |  |

We assessed 30+ proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that even the best models correctly implement less than 40% of the code. We find Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview to perform best at 37.3% success rate, with O3 (High) and O4-mini (High) following behind at 32.3% and 30.8% respectively.

Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines.

Existing safety mechanisms, while improving model safety, often lead to overly cautious behavior and fail to fully leverage LLMs' internal cognitive processes. Inspired by humans' reflective thinking capability, we first show that LLMs can similarly perform internal assessments about safety in their internal states. Building on this insight, we propose SafeSwitch, a dynamic framework that regulates unsafe outputs by utilizing the prober-based internal state monitor that actively detects harmful intentions, and activates a safety head that leads to safer and more conservative responses only when necessary. SafeSwitch reduces harmful outputs by approximately 80% on harmful queries while maintaining strong utility, reaching a Pareto optimal among several methods. Our method is also advantageous over traditional methods in offering more informative, context-aware refusals, and achieves these benefits while only tuning less than 6% of the original parameters. SafeSwitch demonstrates large language models' capacity for self-awareness and reflection regarding safety, offering a promising approach to more nuanced and effective safety controls.

Focusing on the genomics domain, we develop an automated pipeline to extract trainable data and introduce Genome-Bench, a new benchmark constructed from over a decade of scientific forum discussions on genome engineering. Our pipeline transforms raw interactions into a reinforcement learning-friendly multiple-choice questions format, supported by 3000+ high-quality question-answer pairs spanning foundational biology, experimental troubleshooting, tool usage, and beyond. We fine-tune an LLM using RL with a rule-based reward signal derived from the synthetic MCQ dataset to enhance domain-specific reasoning. Our results show that reinforcement learning from scientific discussions improves model performance by over 15% compared to the base model on Genome-Bench, narrowing the gap between open-source LLMs and expert-level reasoning. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end pipeline for teaching LLMs to reason from scientific discussions, with promising potential for generalization across scientific domains beyond biology.</p></details> |  |

We examine this question through the lens of the production-interpretation distinction found in human sentence processing and evaluate the extent to which instruction-tuned LLMs replicate this distinction. Using an empirically documented asymmetry between pronoun production and interpretation in humans for implicit causality verbs as a testbed, we find that some LLMs do quantitatively and qualitatively reflect human-like asymmetries between production and interpretation. We demonstrate that whether this behavior holds depends upon both model size-with larger models more likely to reflect human-like patterns and the choice of meta-linguistic prompts used to elicit the behavior.

However, this reward signal fails to capture notions of maintainability, quality and safety of the code produced. We address this under-explored area and develop a comprehensive library to quantify various aspects of code quality, and use it as a reward in GRPO. We find GRPO increases code quality according to this measure, which is confirmed by expert, blinded human annotators.</p></details> |  |

While RL enables the emergence of complex reasoning behaviors, it often suffers from low sample efficiency when the initial policy struggles to explore high-reward trajectories. Conversely, KD improves learning efficiency via mimicking the teacher model but tends to generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios. In this work, we present \textbf{KDRL}, a \textit{unified post-training framework} that jointly optimizes a reasoning model through teacher supervision (KD) and self-exploration (RL). Specifically, KDRL leverages policy gradient optimization to simultaneously minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (RKL) between the student and teacher distributions while maximizing the expected rule-based rewards. We first formulate a unified objective that integrates GRPO and KD, and systematically explore how different KL approximations, KL coefficients, and reward-guided KD strategies affect the overall post-training dynamics and performance. Empirical results on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KDRL outperforms GRPO and various KD baselines while achieving a favorable balance between performance and reasoning token efficiency. These findings indicate that integrating KD and RL serves as an effective and efficient strategy to train reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |

It requires large language models (LLMs) to engage in genuine temporal reasoning without depending on the factual knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase. Our data generation framework enables on-demand generation of new samples, mitigating the risk of data leakage. We designed three types of time-sensitive questions to test LLMs' temporal reasoning abilities over sequential and parallel event occurrences. Our evaluation of five LLMs on synthetic fact-based TSQA reveals mixed results: while they perform well on simpler subsets, their overall performance remains inferior as compared to real world fact-based TSQA.

Scaling rollout to sample more prompts enables models to selectively use higher-quality data for training, which can stabilize RL training and improve model performance. However, this comes at the cost of significant computational overhead. In this paper, we show that a substantial portion of this overhead can be avoided by skipping uninformative prompts before rollout. Our analysis of reward dynamics reveals a strong temporal consistency in prompt value: prompts that are uninformative in one epoch of training are likely to remain uninformative in future epochs. Based on these insights, we propose GRESO (GRPO with Efficient Selective Rollout), an online, lightweight pre-rollout filtering algorithm that predicts and skips uninformative prompts using reward training dynamics. By evaluating GRESO on a broad range of math reasoning benchmarks and models, such as Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we show that GRESO achieves up to 2.4x wall-clock time speedup in rollout and up to 2.0x speedup in total training time without accuracy degradation.</p></details> |  |

AdvPrompter, which is trained using an alternating optimization algorithm, generates suffixes that veil the input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the TargetLLM is lured to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source TargetLLMs show highly competitive results on the AdvBench and HarmBench datasets, that also transfer to closed-source black-box LLMs. We also show that training on adversarial suffixes generated by AdvPrompter is a promising strategy for improving the robustness of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025.

Conventional approaches measure training data solely by total tokens, yet the number of examples and their average token length -- what we term \emph{dataset volume} -- play a decisive role in model performance. Our formulation is tuned following established procedures. Experiments on the BRICC dataset \cite{salavati2024reducing} and subsets of the MMLU dataset \cite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}, evaluated under multiple subsampling strategies, reveal that data composition significantly affects token efficiency.

However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans.

Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$ effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability.

In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, their deployment is increasingly constrained by substantial computational demands, specifically for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) resources. This paper addresses the critical problem of optimizing resource utilization in LLM agent systems. We introduce COALESCE (Cost-Optimized and Secure Agent Labour Exchange via Skill-based Competence Estimation), a novel framework designed to enable autonomous LLM agents to dynamically outsource specific subtasks to specialized, cost-effective third-party LLM agents. The framework integrates mechanisms for hybrid skill representation, dynamic skill discovery, automated task decomposition, a unified cost model comparing internal execution costs against external outsourcing prices, simplified market-based decision-making algorithms, and a standardized communication protocol between LLM agents. Comprehensive validation through 239 theoretical simulations demonstrates 41.8\% cost reduction potential, while large-scale empirical validation across 240 real LLM tasks confirms 20.3\% cost reduction with proper epsilon-greedy exploration, establishing both theoretical viability and practical effectiveness. The emergence of proposed open standards like Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol further underscores the need for frameworks like COALESCE that can leverage such standards for efficient agent interaction. By facilitating a dynamic market for agent capabilities, potentially utilizing protocols like A2A for communication, COALESCE aims to significantly reduce operational costs, enhance system scalability, and foster the emergence of specialized agent economies, making complex LLM agent functionalities more accessible and economically viable.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures, github linked</p></details> |

Nonetheless, existing systems are inefficient to train MLLMs due to substantial GPU bubbles caused by the heterogeneous modality models and complex data dependencies in 3D parallelism. This paper proposes Optimus, a distributed MLLM training system that reduces end-to-end MLLM training time. Optimus is based on our principled analysis that scheduling the encoder computation within the LLM bubbles can reduce bubbles in MLLM training. To make scheduling encoder computation possible for all GPUs, Optimus searches the separate parallel plans for encoder and LLM, and adopts a bubble scheduling algorithm to enable exploiting LLM bubbles without breaking the original data dependencies in the MLLM model architecture. We further decompose encoder layer computation into a series of kernels, and analyze the common bubble pattern of 3D parallelism to carefully optimize the sub-millisecond bubble scheduling, minimizing the overall training time. Our experiments in a production cluster show that Optimus accelerates MLLM training by 20.5%-21.3% with ViT-22B and GPT-175B model over 3072 GPUs compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |

This approach combines LLM semantic understanding with empirical validation to ensure both interpretability and reliability. We evaluate INVARLLM on SWaT and WADI datasets, achieving 100% precision in anomaly detection with no false alarms, outperforming all existing methods.

This paper introduces a structured framework for understanding the diverse applications of LLM-based agents, ranging from simple data processors to complex, multi-agent systems capable of simulating emergent social dynamics. By mapping this developmental continuum across six levels, the paper clarifies the technical and methodological boundaries between different agentic architectures, providing a comprehensive overview of current capabilities and future potential. It highlights how lower-tier systems streamline conventional tasks like text classification and data annotation, while higher-tier systems enable novel forms of inquiry, including the study of group dynamics, norm formation, and large-scale social processes. However, these advancements also introduce significant challenges, including issues of reproducibility, ethical oversight, and the risk of emergent biases. The paper critically examines these concerns, emphasizing the need for robust validation protocols, interdisciplinary collaboration, and standardized evaluation metrics. It argues that while LLM-based agents hold transformative potential for the social sciences, realizing this promise will require careful, context-sensitive deployment and ongoing methodological refinement. The paper concludes with a call for future research that balances technical innovation with ethical responsibility, encouraging the development of agentic systems that not only replicate but also extend the frontiers of social science, offering new insights into the complexities of human behavior.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825v1)** | 2025-06-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.01825v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code LLMs are increasingly employed in software development. However, studies have shown that they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks: when a trigger (a specific input pattern) appears in the input, the backdoor will be activated and cause the model to generate malicious outputs. Researchers have designed various triggers and demonstrated the feasibility of implanting backdoors by poisoning a fraction of the training data. Some basic conclusions have been made, such as backdoors becoming easier to implant when more training data are modified. However, existing research has not explored other factors influencing backdoor attacks on Code LLMs, such as training batch size, epoch number, and the broader design space for triggers, e.g., trigger length. To bridge this gap, we use code summarization as an example to perform an empirical study that systematically investigates the factors affecting backdoor effectiveness and understands the extent of the threat posed. Three categories of factors are considered: data, model, and inference, revealing previously overlooked findings. We find that the prevailing consensus -- that attacks are ineffective at extremely low poisoning rates -- is incorrect. The absolute number of poisoned samples matters as well. Specifically, poisoning just 20 out of 454K samples (0.004\% poisoning rate -- far below the minimum setting of 0.1\% in prior studies) successfully implants backdoors! Moreover, the common defense is incapable of removing even a single poisoned sample from it. Additionally, small batch sizes increase the risk of backdoor attacks. We also uncover other critical factors such as trigger types, trigger length, and the rarity of tokens in the triggers, leading to valuable insights for assessing Code LLMs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks. Our study highlights the urgent need for defense mechanisms against extremely low poisoning rate settings.</p></details> |  |

Different methods have been proposed to mitigate such hallucinations and fragility -- one of them being measuring the consistency (the model's confidence in the response, or likelihood of generating a similar response when resampled) of LLM responses. In previous work, measuring consistency often relied on the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampled responses, or internal states or logits of responses. However, it is not yet clear how well these approaches approximate how humans perceive the consistency of LLM responses. We performed a user study (n=2,976) and found current methods typically do not approximate users' perceptions of LLM consistency very well. We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimating LLM consistency, and we show that this method matches the performance of the best-performing existing metric in estimating human ratings of LLM consistency. Our results suggest that methods of estimating LLM consistency without human evaluation are sufficiently imperfect that we suggest evaluation with human input be more broadly used.</p></details> |  |

While existing research has explored various forms of LLM bias, a direct, cross-lingual comparison of models with differing geopolitical alignments-specifically a PRC-system model versus a non-PRC counterpart-has been lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating DeepSeek-R1 (PRC-aligned) against ChatGPT o3-mini-high (non-PRC) for Chinese-state propaganda and anti-U.S. sentiment. We developed a novel corpus of 1,200 de-contextualized, reasoning-oriented questions derived from Chinese-language news, presented in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. Answers from both models (7,200 total) were assessed using a hybrid evaluation pipeline combining rubric-guided GPT-4o scoring with human annotation. Our findings reveal significant model-level and language-dependent biases. DeepSeek-R1 consistently exhibited substantially higher proportions of both propaganda and anti-U.S. bias compared to ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which remained largely free of anti-U.S. sentiment and showed lower propaganda levels. For DeepSeek-R1, Simplified Chinese queries elicited the highest bias rates; these diminished in Traditional Chinese and were nearly absent in English. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 occasionally responded in Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese queries and amplified existing PRC-aligned terms in its Chinese answers, demonstrating an "invisible loudspeaker" effect. Furthermore, such biases were not confined to overtly political topics but also permeated cultural and lifestyle content, particularly in DeepSeek-R1.</p></details> |  |

While the evolution of LLM-based autonomous agents is rapidly accelerating, efficient interactions among these agents and their integration with external systems remain significant challenges. In modern AI systems, collaboration between autonomous agents and integration with external tools have become essential elements for building practical AI applications. A2A offers a standardized communication method that enables agents developed in heterogeneous environments to collaborate effectively, while MCP provides a structured I/O framework for agents to connect with external tools and resources. Prior studies have focused primarily on the features and applications of either A2A or MCP individually. In contrast, this study takes an integrated approach, exploring how the two protocols can complement each other to address interoperability issues and facilitate efficient collaboration within complex agent ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

However, there still lack evaluations of LLMs values that fulfill three desirable goals. (1) Value Clarification: We expect to clarify the underlying values of LLMs precisely and comprehensively, while current evaluations focus narrowly on safety risks such as bias and toxicity. (2) Evaluation Validity: Existing static, open-source benchmarks are prone to data contamination and quickly become obsolete as LLMs evolve. Additionally, these discriminative evaluations uncover LLMs' knowledge about values, rather than valid assessments of LLMs' behavioral conformity to values. (3) Value Pluralism: The pluralistic nature of human values across individuals and cultures is largely ignored in measuring LLMs value alignment. To address these challenges, we presents the Value Compass Benchmarks, with three correspondingly designed modules. It (i) grounds the evaluation on motivationally distinct \textit{basic values to clarify LLMs' underlying values from a holistic view; (ii) applies a \textit{generative evolving evaluation framework with adaptive test items for evolving LLMs and direct value recognition from behaviors in realistic scenarios; (iii) propose a metric that quantifies LLMs alignment with a specific value as a weighted sum over multiple dimensions, with weights determined by pluralistic values.</p></details> |  |

By integrating the Mamba network architecture with the diffusion model, the condition network achieves refined conditional control, thereby enhancing the control and optimization of the image generation process. To evaluate the robustness and generalization capability of our method across various image degradation conditions, extensive experiments were conducted on several benchmark datasets, including Rain100H, Rain100L, GoPro, and SSID. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently surpasses existing methods in perceptual quality metrics, such as LPIPS and FID, while maintaining comparable performance in image distortion metrics, including PSNR and SSIM, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability. Notably, ablation experiments reveal that directly noise prediction in the diffusion process achieves better performance, effectively balancing noise suppression and detail preservation. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the Mamba architecture is particularly well-suited as a conditional control network for diffusion models, outperforming both CNN- and Attention-based approaches in this context. Overall, these results highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of ControlMambaIR in addressing a range of image restoration perceptual challenges.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an innovative multi-modal watermarking approach, drawing on the concept of vector discretization in encoder-based vector quantization. By constructing adjacency matrices, the proposed method enables the transformation of text watermarks into robust image-based representations, providing a novel multi-modal watermarking paradigm for image generation applications. Additionally, this study presents a newly designed image restoration module to mitigate image degradation caused by transmission losses and various noise interferences, thereby ensuring the reliability and integrity of the watermark. Experimental results validate the robustness of the method under multiple noise attacks, providing a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for digital image copyright protection.</p></details> |  |

This challenge established a new benchmark for real-world image restoration, featuring diverse scenarios with and without reference ground truth. Participants were tasked with restoring real-captured images suffering from complex and unknown degradations, where both perceptual quality and fidelity were critically evaluated. The challenge comprised two tracks: (1) the low-light joint denoising and demosaicing (JDD) task, and (2) the image detail enhancement/generation task. Each track included two sub-tasks. The first sub-task involved paired data with available ground truth, enabling quantitative evaluation. The second sub-task dealt with real-world yet unpaired images, emphasizing restoration efficiency and subjective quality assessed through a comprehensive user study. In total, the challenge attracted nearly 300 registrations, with 51 teams submitting more than 600 results. The top-performing methods advanced the state of the art in image restoration and received unanimous recognition from all 20+ expert judges.

| **[UniRestore: Unified Perceptual and Task-Oriented Image Restoration Model Using Diffusion Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13134v2)** | 2025-06-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.13134v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to recover content from inputs degraded by various factors, such as adverse weather, blur, and noise. Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025 (Highlight); Project Page: https://unirestore.github.io</p></details> |

Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Restoration Learning via Noisy Supervision in the Fourier Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00564v1)** | 2025-05-31 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.00564v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Noisy supervision refers to supervising image restoration learning with noisy targets. It can alleviate the data collection burden and enhance the practical applicability of deep learning techniques. However, existing methods suffer from two key drawbacks. Firstly, they are ineffective in handling spatially correlated noise commonly observed in practical applications such as low-light imaging and remote sensing. Secondly, they rely on pixel-wise loss functions that only provide limited supervision information. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging the Fourier domain. We highlight that the Fourier coefficients of spatially correlated noise exhibit sparsity and independence, making them easier to handle. Additionally, Fourier coefficients contain global information, enabling more significant supervision. Motivated by these insights, we propose to establish noisy supervision in the Fourier domain. We first prove that Fourier coefficients of a wide range of noise converge in distribution to the Gaussian distribution. Exploiting this statistical property, we establish the equivalence between using noisy targets and clean targets in the Fourier domain. This leads to a unified learning framework applicable to various image restoration tasks, diverse network architectures, and different noise models. Extensive experiments validate the outstanding performance of this framework in terms of both quantitative indices and perceptual quality.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically require training a bridge model from scratch for each specific type of degradation, resulting in high computational costs and limited performance. This work aims to efficiently leverage pretrained generative priors within existing image restoration bridges to eliminate this requirement. The main challenge is that standard generative models are typically designed for a diffusion process that starts from pure noise, while restoration tasks begin with a low-quality image, resulting in a mismatch in the state distributions between the two processes. To address this challenge, we propose a transition equation that bridges two diffusion processes with the same endpoint distribution. Based on this, we introduce the IRBridge framework, which enables the direct utilization of generative models within image restoration bridges, offering a more flexible and adaptable approach to image restoration. Extensive experiments on six image restoration tasks demonstrate that IRBridge efficiently integrates generative priors, resulting in improved robustness and generalization performance. Code will be available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Self-Improved Privilege Learning (SIPL), a novel paradigm that overcomes these limitations by innovatively extending the utility of privileged information (PI) beyond training into the inference stage. Unlike conventional Privilege Learning, where ground-truth-derived guidance is typically discarded after training, SIPL empowers the model to leverage its own preliminary outputs as pseudo-privileged signals for iterative self-refinement at test time. Central to SIPL is Proxy Fusion, a lightweight module incorporating a learnable Privileged Dictionary. During training, this dictionary distills essential high-frequency and structural priors from privileged feature representations. Critically, at inference, the same learned dictionary then interacts with features derived from the model's initial restoration, facilitating a self-correction loop. SIPL can be seamlessly integrated into various backbone architectures, offering substantial performance improvements with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIPL significantly advances the state-of-the-art on diverse all-in-one image restoration benchmarks. For instance, when integrated with the PromptIR model, SIPL achieves remarkable PSNR improvements of +4.58 dB on composite degradation tasks and +1.28 dB on diverse five-task benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness and broad applicability. Codes are available at our project page https://github.com/Aitical/SIPL.</p></details> |  |

However, generating accurate lesion descriptions remains challenging due to spurious correlations from visual-linguistic biases and inherent limitations of radiological imaging, such as low resolution and noise interference. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage framework named CrossModal Causal Representation Learning (CMCRL), consisting of the Radiological Cross-modal Alignment and Reconstruction Enhanced (RadCARE) pre-training and the Visual-Linguistic Causal Intervention (VLCI) fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, RadCARE introduces a degradation-aware masked image restoration strategy tailored for radiological images, which reconstructs high-resolution patches from low-resolution inputs to mitigate noise and detail loss. Combined with a multiway architecture and four adaptive training strategies (e.g., text postfix generation with degraded images and text prefixes), RadCARE establishes robust cross-modal correlations even with incomplete data. In the VLCI phase, we deploy causal front-door intervention through two modules: the Visual Deconfounding Module (VDM) disentangles local-global features without fine-grained annotations, while the Linguistic Deconfounding Module (LDM) eliminates context bias without external terminology databases. Experiments on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR show that our CMCRL pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both stages.

PnP approaches, a class of iterative algorithms where regularization is implicitly performed by an off-the-shelf deep denoiser, are flexible for varying compression ratios (CRs) but are limited in reconstruction accuracy and speed. Conversely, unrolling approaches, a class of multi-stage neural networks where a truncated iterative optimization process is transformed into an end-to-end trainable network, typically achieve better accuracy with faster inference but require fine-tuning or even retraining when CR changes. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating the strengths of both classes of solvers. To this end, we design an efficient deep image restorer (DIR) for the unrolling of HQS (half quadratic splitting) and ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers). More importantly, a general proximal trajectory (PT) loss function is proposed to train HQS/ADMM-unrolling networks such that learned DIR approximates the proximal operator of an ideal explicit restoration regularizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, the resulting proximal unrolling networks can not only flexibly handle varying CRs with a single model like PnP algorithms, but also outperform previous CR-specific unrolling networks in both reconstruction accuracy and speed.

To address these challenges, we introduce a Unified Receptance Weighted Key Value (URWKV) model with multi-state perspective, enabling flexible and effective degradation restoration for low-light images. Specifically, we customize the core URWKV block to perceive and analyze complex degradations by leveraging multiple intra- and inter-stage states. First, inspired by the pupil mechanism in the human visual system, we propose Luminance-adaptive Normalization (LAN) that adjusts normalization parameters based on rich inter-stage states, allowing for adaptive, scene-aware luminance modulation. Second, we aggregate multiple intra-stage states through exponential moving average approach, effectively capturing subtle variations while mitigating information loss inherent in the single-state mechanism. To reduce the degradation effects commonly associated with conventional skip connections, we propose the State-aware Selective Fusion (SSF) module, which dynamically aligns and integrates multi-state features across encoder stages, selectively fusing contextual information. In comparison to state-of-the-art models, our URWKV model achieves superior performance on various benchmarks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However, due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers. EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |

Although existing AiOIR approaches obtain promising performance in closed and controlled scenarios, they still suffered from considerable performance reduction in real-world scenarios since the gap of data distributions between the training samples (source domain) and real-world test samples (target domain) can lead inferior degradation awareness ability. To address this issue, a Unified Domain-Adaptive Image Restoration (UDAIR) framework is proposed to effectively achieve AiOIR by leveraging the learned knowledge from source domain to target domain. To improve the degradation identification, a codebook is designed to learn a group of discrete embeddings to denote the degradation patterns, and the cross-sample contrastive learning mechanism is further proposed to capture shared features from different samples of certain degradation. To bridge the data gap, a domain adaptation strategy is proposed to build the feature projection between the source and target domains by dynamically aligning their codebook embeddings, and a correlation alignment-based test-time adaptation mechanism is designed to fine-tune the alignment discrepancies by tightening the degradation embeddings to the corresponding cluster center in the source domain. Experimental results on 10 open-source datasets demonstrate that UDAIR achieves new state-of-the-art performance for the AiOIR task. Most importantly, the feature cluster validate the degradation identification under unknown conditions, and qualitative comparisons showcase robust generalization to real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

First, we synthesize document-image pairs from plaintext, rendering them with diverse fonts and layouts and then applying a randomly ordered set of degradation operations. An image restoration model is trained on this synthetic data, using multi-directional patch extraction and fusion to process large images. Second, a ByT5 post-OCR model, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text pairs, addresses remaining OCR errors. Detailed experiments on 13,831 pages of real historical documents in English, French, and Spanish show that the PreP-OCR pipeline reduces character error rates by 63.9-70.3% compared to OCR on raw images.

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

While reference faces offer a path forward, existing reference-based methods often fail to fully exploit their potential. This paper introduces a novel approach that maximizes reference face utility for improved face restoration and identity preservation. Our method makes three key contributions: 1) Composite Context, a comprehensive representation that fuses multi-level (high- and low-level) information from the reference face, offering richer guidance than prior singular representations. 2) Hard Example Identity Loss, a novel loss function that leverages the reference face to address the identity learning inefficiencies found in the existing identity loss. 3) A training-free method to adapt the model to multi-reference inputs during inference. The proposed method demonstrably restores high-quality faces and achieves state-of-the-art identity preserving restoration on benchmarks such as FFHQ-Ref and CelebA-Ref-Test, consistently outperforming previous work.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a multi-source representation learning framework BaryIR, which decomposes the latent space of multi-source degraded images into a continuous barycenter space for unified feature encoding and source-specific subspaces for specific semantic encoding. Specifically, we seek the multi-source unified representation by introducing a multi-source latent optimal transport barycenter problem, in which a continuous barycenter map is learned to transport the latent representations to the barycenter space. The transport cost is designed such that the representations from source-specific subspaces are contrasted with each other while maintaining orthogonality to those from the barycenter space. This enables BaryIR to learn compact representations with unified degradation-agnostic information from the barycenter space, as well as degradation-specific semantics from source-specific subspaces, capturing the inherent geometry of multi-source data manifold for generalizable AIR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Particularly, BaryIR exhibits superior generalization ability to real-world data and unseen degradations. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/xl-tang3/BaryIR.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods often suffer from limited representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration, providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the degenerate PPP method exhibits weak convergence in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and lacks accelerated variants. To address these issues, we propose a Halpern-type PPP (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence and acceleration properties of Halpern's iteration method. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm for image restoration by combining HPPP with denoiser priors such as Plug-and-Play (PnP) prior, which can be viewed as an accelerated PnP method. Finally, numerical experiments including several toy examples and image restoration validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, persistent visual degradation, including smoke generated by energy devices, lens fogging from thermal gradients, and lens contamination due to blood or tissue fluid splashes during surgical procedures, severely impair visual clarity. These degenerations can seriously hinder surgical workflow and pose risks to patient safety. To systematically investigate and address various forms of surgical scene degradation, we introduce a real-world open-source surgical image restoration dataset covering laparoscopic environments, called SurgClean, which involves multi-type image restoration tasks, e.g., desmoking, defogging, and desplashing. SurgClean comprises 1,020 images with diverse degradation types and corresponding paired reference labels. Based on SurgClean, we establish a standardized evaluation benchmark and provide performance for 22 representative generic task-specific image restoration approaches, including 12 generic and 10 task-specific image restoration approaches. Experimental results reveal substantial performance gaps relative to clinical requirements, highlighting a critical opportunity for algorithm advancements in intelligent surgical restoration. Furthermore, we explore the degradation discrepancies between surgical and natural scenes from structural perception and semantic understanding perspectives, providing fundamental insights for domain-specific image restoration research. Our work aims to empower the capabilities of restoration algorithms to increase surgical environments and improve the efficiency of clinical procedures.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, especially those relying on direct image-to-image restoration, often fail to disentangle these intertwined artifacts effectively. While wavelet-based frequency-aware approaches offer a promising direction, their potential remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Freqformer, a Transformer-based framework specifically designed for image demoir\'eing through targeted frequency separation. Our method performs an effective frequency decomposition that explicitly splits moir\'e patterns into high-frequency spatially-localized textures and low-frequency scale-robust color distortions, which are then handled by a dual-branch architecture tailored to their distinct characteristics. We further propose a learnable Frequency Composition Transform (FCT) module to adaptively fuse the frequency-specific outputs, enabling consistent and high-fidelity reconstruction. To better aggregate the spatial dependencies and the inter-channel complementary information, we introduce a Spatial-Aware Channel Attention (SA-CA) module that refines moir\'e-sensitive regions without incurring high computational cost. Extensive experiments on various demoir\'eing benchmarks demonstrate that Freqformer achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact model size.

Despite recent advances, most existing approaches treat IR as a direct mapping problem, relying on shared representations across degradation types without modeling their structural diversity. In this work, we present MIRAGE, a unified and lightweight framework for all in one IR that explicitly decomposes the input feature space into three semantically aligned parallel branches, each processed by a specialized module attention for global context, convolution for local textures, and MLP for channel-wise statistics. This modular decomposition significantly improves generalization and efficiency across diverse degradations. Furthermore, we introduce a cross layer contrastive learning scheme that aligns shallow and latent features to enhance the discriminability of shared representations. To better capture the underlying geometry of feature representations, we perform contrastive learning in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space rather than the conventional Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that MIRAGE not only achieves new state of the art performance across a variety of degradation types but also offers a scalable solution for challenging all-in-one IR scenarios.

However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task.

However, UniDB's reliance on iterative Euler sampling methods results in slow, computationally expensive inference, while existing acceleration techniques for diffusion or diffusion bridge models fail to address its unique challenges: missing terminal mean constraints and SOC-specific penalty coefficients in its SDEs. We present UniDB++, a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly improves upon these limitations. The method's key advancement comes from deriving exact closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDEs, effectively reducing the error accumulation inherent in Euler approximations and enabling high-quality generation with up to 20$\times$ fewer sampling steps. This method is further complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains perceptual quality for low-step regimes (5-10 steps). Additionally, we demonstrate that UniDB++ aligns with existing diffusion bridge acceleration methods by evaluating their update rules, and UniDB++ can recover DBIMs as special cases under some theoretical conditions. Experiments demonstrate UniDB++'s state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks, outperforming Euler-based methods in fidelity and speed while reducing inference time significantly. This work bridges the gap between theoretical generality and practical efficiency in SOC-driven diffusion bridge models.

Accurately estimating the underlying degradation can intuitively provide restoration models with more targeted and effective guidance, enabling adaptive processing strategies. To this end, we propose a Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism (MODEM) for adverse weather image restoration. Central to MODEM is the Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module (MOS2D), which integrates Morton-coded spatial ordering with selective state-space models to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local structural coherence. Complementing MOS2D, we introduce a Dual Degradation Estimation Module (DDEM) that disentangles and estimates both global and local degradation priors. These priors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and context-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex degradation dynamics.

In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent linear stochastic differential equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its simplicity, achieves competitive performance on various image-conditioned (e.g., image restoration) and unconditional generation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generative modelling.

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradation specific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms state-of-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models.</p></details> |  |

This paper first explores the challenging multi-weather nighttime image restoration task, where various types of weather degradations are intertwined with flare effects. To support the research, we contribute the AllWeatherNight dataset, featuring large-scale high-quality nighttime images with diverse compositional degradations, synthesized using our introduced illumination-aware degradation generation. Moreover, we present ClearNight, a unified nighttime image restoration framework, which effectively removes complex degradations in one go. Specifically, ClearNight extracts Retinex-based dual priors and explicitly guides the network to focus on uneven illumination regions and intrinsic texture contents respectively, thereby enhancing restoration effectiveness in nighttime scenarios. In order to better represent the common and unique characters of multiple weather degradations, we introduce a weather-aware dynamic specific-commonality collaboration method, which identifies weather degradations and adaptively selects optimal candidate units associated with specific weather types. Our ClearNight achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world images.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer hinders its applicability to high-resolution images. Existing methods mitigate this issue with sparse or window-based attention, yet inherently limit global context modeling. Linear attention, a variant of softmax attention, demonstrates promise in global context modeling while maintaining linear complexity, offering a potential solution to the above challenge. Despite its efficiency benefits, vanilla linear attention suffers from a significant performance drop in IR, largely due to the low-rank nature of its attention map. To counter this, we propose Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA), a simple yet effective method that enriches feature representations by integrating a lightweight depthwise convolution. Building upon RELA, we propose an efficient and effective image restoration Transformer, named LAformer. LAformer achieves effective global perception by integrating linear attention and channel attention, while also enhancing local fitting capabilities through a convolutional gated feed-forward network. Notably, LAformer eliminates hardware-inefficient operations such as softmax and window shifting, enabling efficient processing of high-resolution images. Extensive experiments across 7 IR tasks and 21 benchmarks demonstrate that LAformer outperforms SOTA methods and offers significant computational advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

While significant progress has been made, there are still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches depend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex or unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second, many methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and finally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain for guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations through a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse transform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline through two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the pixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space to reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate latent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward model to handle unknown degradations. In addition, a regularization step preserves the proximity of latent variables to the natural image manifold. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world low-quality images, and can be readily adapted to arbitrary output sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |

Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code, and dataset of this project will be released upon publication at github.com/yangwenbo99/content-degradation-disentanglement.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the significant variations among degradation types present challenges for training a universal model, often resulting in task interference, where the gradient update directions of different tasks may diverge due to shared parameters. To address this issue, motivated by the routing strategy, we propose DFPIR, a novel all-in-one image restorer that introduces Degradation-aware Feature Perturbations(DFP) to adjust the feature space to align with the unified parameter space. In this paper, the feature perturbations primarily include channel-wise perturbations and attention-wise perturbations. Specifically, channel-wise perturbations are implemented by shuffling the channels in high-dimensional space guided by degradation types, while attention-wise perturbations are achieved through selective masking in the attention space. To achieve these goals, we propose a Degradation-Guided Perturbation Block (DGPB) to implement these two functions, positioned between the encoding and decoding stages of the encoder-decoder architecture. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DFPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several all-in-one image restoration tasks including image denoising, image dehazing, image deraining, motion deblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

In this work, we investigate its potential impact on the image restoration community. We present the first systematic evaluation of GPT-4o across diverse restoration tasks. Our experiments reveal that, although restoration outputs from GPT-4o are visually appealing, they often suffer from pixel-level structural fidelity when compared to ground-truth images. Common issues are variations in image proportions, shifts in object positions and quantities, and changes in viewpoint. To address it, taking image dehazing, derainning, and low-light enhancement as representative case studies, we show that GPT-4o's outputs can serve as powerful visual priors, substantially enhancing the performance of existing dehazing networks. It offers practical guidelines and a baseline framework to facilitate the integration of GPT-4o into future image restoration pipelines. We hope the study on GPT-4o image restoration will accelerate innovation in the broader field of image generation areas. To support further research, we will release GPT-4o-restored images.</p></details> |  |

Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |

However, reducing acquisition time to increase throughput inevitably introduces significant noise into the measurements. We present a machine learning approach that not only denoises low-quality measurements with calibrated uncertainty bounds, but also reveals emergent structure in the latent space. By using ensembles of lightweight, randomly structured neural networks trained via conformal quantile regression, our method performs reliable denoising while uncovering interpretable spatial and chemical features -- without requiring labels or segmentation. Unlike conventional approaches focused solely on image restoration, our framework leverages the denoising process itself to drive the emergence of meaningful representations. We validate the approach on real-world geobiochemical imaging data, showing how it supports confident interpretation and guides experimental design under resource constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods don't adequately account for generalizability issues, and hence typically show limited performance and low stability on test data from other sources. Considering the limited availability of distinct data sources, we seek to improve the generalization performance of a pancreas segmentation model trained with a single-source dataset, i.e., the single source generalization task. In particular, we propose a dual self-supervised learning model that incorporates both global and local anatomical contexts. Our model aims to fully exploit the anatomical features of the intra-pancreatic and extra-pancreatic regions, and hence enhance the characterization of the high-uncertainty regions for more robust generalization. Specifically, we first construct a global-feature contrastive self-supervised learning module that is guided by the pancreatic spatial structure. This module obtains complete and consistent pancreatic features through promoting intra-class cohesion, and also extracts more discriminative features for differentiating between pancreatic and non-pancreatic tissues through maximizing inter-class separation. It mitigates the influence of surrounding tissue on the segmentation outcomes in high-uncertainty regions. Subsequently, a local-image restoration self-supervised learning module is introduced to further enhance the characterization of the high uncertainty regions. In this module, informative anatomical contexts are actually learned to recover randomly corrupted appearance patterns in those regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by IEEE JBHI.

However, the performance of DUN-based methods remains considerably inferior to that of state-of-the-art IDIR solvers. Our investigation indicates that this limitation does not stem from structural shortcomings of DUNs but rather from the limited exploration of the unfolding structure, particularly for (1) constructing task-specific restoration models, (2) integrating advanced network architectures, and (3) designing DUN-specific loss functions. To address these issues, we propose a novel DUN-based method, UnfoldIR, for IDIR tasks. UnfoldIR first introduces a new IDIR model with dedicated regularization terms for smoothing illumination and enhancing texture. We unfold the iterative optimized solution of this model into a multistage network, with each stage comprising a reflectance-assisted illumination correction (RAIC) module and an illumination-guided reflectance enhancement (IGRE) module. RAIC employs a visual state space (VSS) to extract non-local features, enforcing illumination smoothness, while IGRE introduces a frequency-aware VSS to globally align similar textures, enabling mildly degraded regions to guide the enhancement of details in more severely degraded areas. This suppresses noise while enhancing details. Furthermore, given the multistage structure, we propose an inter-stage information consistent loss to maintain network stability in the final stages. This loss contributes to structural preservation and sustains the model's performance even in unsupervised settings. Experiments verify our effectiveness across 5 IDIR tasks and 3 downstream problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 tables, 11 figures</p></details> |

Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a single image input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 SyntaGen Workshop, Project Page: https://yc4ny.github.io/SVAD/</p></details> |

While T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors. Our experiments demonstrate that EAM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{DGSolver}, a diffusion generalist solver with universal posterior sampling. We first derive the exact ordinary differential equations for generalist diffusion models and tailor high-order solvers with a queue-based accelerated sampling strategy to improve both accuracy and efficiency. We then integrate universal posterior sampling to better approximate manifold-constrained gradients, yielding a more accurate noise estimation and correcting errors in inverse inference. Extensive experiments show that DGSolver outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoration accuracy, stability, and scalability, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Moreover, these methods often utilize highly customized backbones, which hinder their adaptability and integration into more advanced restoration networks. To address these limitations, we propose Perceive-IR, a novel backbone-agnostic All-in-One image restoration framework designed for fine-grained quality control across various degradation types and severity levels. Its modular structure allows core components to function independently of specific backbones, enabling seamless integration into advanced restoration models without significant modifications. Specifically, Perceive-IR operates in two key stages: 1) multi-level quality-driven prompt learning stage, where a fine-grained quality perceiver is meticulously trained to discern three tier quality levels by optimizing the alignment between prompts and images within the CLIP perception space. This stage ensures a nuanced understanding of image quality, laying the groundwork for subsequent restoration; 2) restoration stage, where the quality perceiver is seamlessly integrated with a difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss, forming a quality-aware learning strategy. This strategy not only dynamically differentiates sample learning difficulty but also achieves fine-grained quality control by driving the restored image toward the ground truth while pulling it away from both low- and medium-quality samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.

Consequently, image restoration has emerged as a key solution and garnered substantial attention. Although recent Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive success across various restoration tasks, their considerable model complexity poses significant challenges for both training and real-time deployment. Furthermore, instead of investigating the commonalities among different degradations, most existing restoration methods focus on modifying Transformer under limited restoration priors. In this work, we first review various degradation phenomena under multi-domain perspective, identifying common priors. Then, we introduce a novel restoration framework, which integrates multi-domain learning into Transformer. Specifically, in Token Mixer, we propose a Spatial-Wavelet-Fourier multi-domain structure that facilitates local-region-global multi-receptive field modeling to replace vanilla self-attention. Additionally, in Feed-Forward Network, we incorporate multi-scale learning to fuse multi-domain features at different resolutions. Comprehensive experimental results across ten restoration tasks, such as dehazing, desnowing, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, rain streak/raindrop removal, cloud removal, shadow removal, underwater enhancement and low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a favorable trade-off among restoration performance, parameter size, computational cost and inference latency.

We address infrared deturbulence as an image restoration task, proposing DparNet, a parameter-assisted multi-frame network with a wide & deep architecture. DparNet learns a degradation prior (key parameter matrix) directly from degraded images without external knowledge. Its wide & deep architecture uses these learned parameters to directly modulate restoration, achieving spatially and intensity adaptive results. Evaluated on dedicated infrared deturbulence (49,744 images) and visible image denoising (109,536 images) datasets, DparNet significantly outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods in restoration performance and efficiency. Notably, leveraging these parameters improves PSNR by 0.6-1.1 dB with less than 2% increase in model parameters and computational complexity. Our work demonstrates that degraded images hide key degradation information that can be learned and utilized to boost adaptive image restoration.</p></details> |  |

Yet, due to hardware limitations, operational variability, and patient compliance, fundus images often suffer from low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Recent years have witnessed promising progress in fundus image enhancement. However, existing works usually focus on restoring structural details or global characteristics of fundus images, lacking a unified image enhancement framework to recover comprehensive multi-scale information. Moreover, few methods pinpoint the target of image enhancement, e.g., lesions, which is crucial for medical image-based diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale target-aware representation learning framework (MTRL-FIE) for efficient fundus image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature encoder (MFE) that employs wavelet decomposition to embed both low-frequency structural information and high-frequency details. Next, we design a structure-preserving hierarchical decoder (SHD) to fuse multi-scale feature embeddings for real fundus image restoration. SHD integrates hierarchical fusion and group attention mechanisms to achieve adaptive feature fusion while retaining local structural smoothness. Meanwhile, a target-aware feature aggregation (TFA) module is used to enhance pathological regions and reduce artifacts. Experimental results on multiple fundus image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MTRL-FIE for fundus image enhancement. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MTRL-FIE achieves superior enhancement performance with a more lightweight architecture. Furthermore, our approach generalizes to other ophthalmic image processing tasks without supervised fine-tuning, highlighting its potential for clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at Neural Networks</p></details> |

The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

GuideSR addresses this limitation by introducing a dual-branch architecture comprising: (1) a Guidance Branch that preserves high-fidelity structures from the original-resolution degraded input, and (2) a Diffusion Branch, which a pre-trained latent diffusion model to enhance perceptual quality. Unlike conventional conditioning mechanisms, our Guidance Branch features a tailored structure for image restoration tasks, combining Full Resolution Blocks (FRBs) with channel attention and an Image Guidance Network (IGN) with guided attention. By embedding detailed structural information directly into the restoration pipeline, GuideSR produces sharper and more visually consistent results. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GuideSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the low computational cost of single-step approaches, with up to 1.39dB PSNR gain on challenging real-world datasets.

Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

Existing approaches typically rely on Degradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide image restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation information and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome these limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration framework. By integrating a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM) and a High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB), DPMambaIR enables fine-grained modeling of complex degradation information and efficient global integration, while mitigating the loss of high-frequency details caused by task competition. Specifically, the DP-SSM utilizes a pre-trained degradation extractor to capture fine-grained degradation features and dynamically incorporates them into the state space modeling process, enhancing the model's adaptability to diverse degradation types. Concurrently, the HEB supplements high-frequency information, effectively addressing the loss of critical details, such as edges and textures, in multi-task image restoration scenarios. Extensive experiments on a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR achieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM, respectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of DPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion transformers (DiTs), like SD3, are emerging as a promising alternative because of their better quality with scalability. In this paper, we introduce DPIR (Dual Prompting Image Restoration), a novel image restoration method that effectivly extracts conditional information of low-quality images from multiple perspectives. Specifically, DPIR consits of two branches: a low-quality image conditioning branch and a dual prompting control branch. The first branch utilizes a lightweight module to incorporate image priors into the DiT with high efficiency. More importantly, we believe that in image restoration, textual description alone cannot fully capture its rich visual characteristics. Therefore, a dual prompting module is designed to provide DiT with additional visual cues, capturing both global context and local appearance. The extracted global-local visual prompts as extra conditional control, alongside textual prompts to form dual prompts, greatly enhance the quality of the restoration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DPIR delivers superior image restoration performance.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

However, long-range attention often results in computational overhead without practical necessity, as degradation and context are typically localized. Normalized average attention distance across various degradation datasets shows that middle-range attention is enough for image restoration. Building on this insight, we propose RouteWinFormer, a novel window-based Transformer that models middle-range context for image restoration. RouteWinFormer incorporates Route-Windows Attnetion Module, which dynamically selects relevant nearby windows based on regional similarity for attention aggregation, extending the receptive field to a mid-range size efficiently. In addition, we introduce Multi-Scale Structure Regularization during training, enabling the sub-scale of the U-shaped network to focus on structural information, while the original-scale learns degradation patterns based on generalized image structure priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RouteWinFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 9 datasets in various image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment Transformer for Image Deraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16455v1)** | 2025-04-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.16455v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based networks have achieved strong performance in low-level vision tasks like image deraining by utilizing spatial or channel-wise self-attention. However, irregular rain patterns and complex geometric overlaps challenge single-paradigm architectures, necessitating a unified framework to integrate complementary global-local and spatial-channel representations. To address this, we propose a novel Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment Transformer (CPRAformer). Its core idea is the hierarchical representation and alignment, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms (spatial-channel and global-local) to aid image reconstruction. It bridges the gap within and between paradigms, aligning and coordinating them to enable deep interaction and fusion of features. Specifically, we use two types of self-attention in the Transformer blocks: sparse prompt channel self-attention (SPC-SA) and spatial pixel refinement self-attention (SPR-SA). SPC-SA enhances global channel dependencies through dynamic sparsity, while SPR-SA focuses on spatial rain distribution and fine-grained texture recovery. To address the feature misalignment and knowledge differences between them, we introduce the Adaptive Alignment Frequency Module (AAFM), which aligns and interacts with features in a two-stage progressive manner, enabling adaptive guidance and complementarity. This reduces the information gap within and between paradigms. Through this unified cross-paradigm dynamic interaction framework, we achieve the extraction of the most valuable interactive fusion information from the two paradigms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmark datasets and further validates CPRAformer's robustness in other image restoration tasks and downstream applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/zs1314/CPRAformer</p></details> |

Firstly, we extend the Ambient Diffusion framework to enable training directly from measurements corrupted in the Fourier domain. Subsequently, we train diffusion models for MRI with access only to Fourier subsampled multi-coil measurements at acceleration factors R= 2,4,6,8. Secondly, we propose Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling (A-DPS), a reconstruction algorithm that leverages generative models pre-trained on one type of corruption (e.g. image inpainting) to perform posterior sampling on measurements from a different forward process (e.g. image blurring). For MRI reconstruction in high acceleration regimes, we observe that A-DPS models trained on subsampled data are better suited to solving inverse problems than models trained on fully sampled data. We also test the efficacy of A-DPS on natural image datasets (CelebA, FFHQ, and AFHQ) and show that A-DPS can sometimes outperform models trained on clean data for several image restoration tasks in both speed and performance.</p></details> |  |

However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image restoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\% of the training cost compared to current approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

A key challenge in image restoration is the lack of high-quality, paired-label images required for training supervised models. In this paper, we introduce the Circular Quasi-Conformal Deturbulence (CQCD) framework, an unsupervised approach for removing image distortions through a circular architecture. This design ensures that the restored image remains both geometrically accurate and visually faithful while preventing the accumulation of incorrect estimations. The circular restoration process involves both forward and inverse mapping. To ensure the bijectivity of the estimated non-rigid deformations, computational quasi-conformal geometry theories are leveraged to regularize the mapping, enforcing its homeomorphic properties. This guarantees a well-defined transformation that preserves structural integrity and prevents unwanted artifacts. Furthermore, tight-frame blocks are integrated to encode distortion-sensitive features for precise recovery. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct evaluations on various synthetic and real-world captured images. Experimental results demonstrate that CQCD not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art deturbulence methods in terms of image restoration quality but also provides highly accurate deformation field estimations.</p></details> |  |

Dataset distillation is a potential solution to this problem, yet current distillation techniques are a blank canvas in the field of image restoration. To fill this gap, we propose the Distribution-aware Dataset Distillation method (TripleD), a new framework that extends the principles of dataset distillation to image restoration. Specifically, TripleD uses a pre-trained vision Transformer to extract features from images for complexity evaluation, and the subset (the number of samples is much smaller than the original training set) is selected based on complexity. The selected subset is then fed through a lightweight CNN that fine-tunes the image distribution to align with the distribution of the original dataset at the feature level. To efficiently condense knowledge, the training is divided into two stages. Early stages focus on simpler, low-complexity samples to build foundational knowledge, while later stages select more complex and uncertain samples as the model matures. Our method achieves promising performance on multiple image restoration tasks, including multi-task image restoration, all-in-one image restoration, and ultra-high-definition image restoration tasks. Note that we can train a state-of-the-art image restoration model on an ultra-high-definition (4K resolution) dataset using only one consumer-grade GPU in less than 8 hours (500 savings in computing resources and immeasurable training time).</p></details> |  |

In recent years, researchers have focused on developing general-purpose IR models capable of handling diverse degradation types, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of model development. Current mainstream approaches are based on three architectural paradigms: CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas. CNNs excel in efficient inference, whereas Transformers and Mamba excel at capturing long-range dependencies and modeling global contexts. While each architecture has demonstrated success in specialized, single-task settings, limited efforts have been made to effectively integrate heterogeneous architectures to jointly address diverse IR challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose RestorMixer, an efficient and general-purpose IR model based on mixed-architecture fusion. RestorMixer adopts a three-stage encoder-decoder structure, where each stage is tailored to the resolution and feature characteristics of the input. In the initial high-resolution stage, CNN-based blocks are employed to rapidly extract shallow local features. In the subsequent stages, we integrate a refined multi-directional scanning Mamba module with a multi-scale window-based self-attention mechanism. This hierarchical and adaptive design enables the model to leverage the strengths of CNNs in local feature extraction, Mamba in global context modeling, and attention mechanisms in dynamic feature refinement. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RestorMixer achieves leading performance across multiple IR tasks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

In contrast, both camera RAW and high dynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, in which color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light. While training on commonly available display-encoded images is a well-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In this work, we test several approaches on three popular image restoration applications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. We examine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using popular transfer functions (PQ, PU21, and mu-law), or whether it is better to train in linear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptual non-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantly better on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, which offer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to the training strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, between 2 and 9 dB.</p></details> |  |

Traditional solutions typically involve training dedicated models per degradation, resulting in inefficiency and redundancy. More recent approaches either introduce additional modules to learn visual prompts, significantly increasing model size, or incorporate cross-modal transfer from large language models trained on vast datasets, adding complexity to the system architecture. In contrast, our approach, termed AnyIR, takes a unified path that leverages inherent similarity across various degradations to enable both efficient and comprehensive restoration through a joint embedding mechanism, without scaling up the model or relying on large language models.Specifically, we examine the sub-latent space of each input, identifying key components and reweighting them first in a gated manner. To fuse the intrinsic degradation awareness and the contextualized attention, a spatial-frequency parallel fusion strategy is proposed for enhancing spatial-aware local-global interactions and enriching the restoration details from the frequency perspective. Extensive benchmarking in the all-in-one restoration setting confirms AnyIR's SOTA performance, reducing model complexity by around 82\% in parameters and 85\% in FLOPs.

This paper introduces a novel Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction (SADRE) framework for watermark elimination on the web, combining adaptive noise injection, region-specific perturbations, and advanced diffusion-based reconstruction. SADRE disrupts embedded watermarks by injecting targeted noise into latent representations guided by saliency masks although preserving essential image features. A reverse diffusion process ensures high-fidelity image restoration, leveraging adaptive noise levels determined by watermark strength. Our framework is theoretically grounded with stability guarantees and achieves robust watermark removal across diverse scenarios.

This stems from a reliance on indirect cues which poorly capture the true perceptual quality deficit. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce AdaQual-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that integrates perceptual quality assessment directly into the generative restoration process. Our approach establishes a mathematical relationship between regional quality scores from DeQAScore and optimal guidance complexity, implemented through an Adaptive Quality Prompting mechanism. This mechanism systematically modulates prompt structure according to measured degradation severity: regions with lower perceptual quality receive computationally intensive, structurally complex prompts with precise restoration directives, while higher quality regions receive minimal prompts focused on preservation rather than intervention. The technical core of our method lies in the dynamic allocation of computational resources proportional to degradation severity, creating a spatially-varying guidance field that directs the diffusion process with mathematical precision. By combining this quality-guided approach with content-specific conditioning, our framework achieves fine-grained control over regional restoration intensity without requiring additional parameters or inference iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaQual-Diff achieves visually superior restorations across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Despite the success achieved by existing deep learning-based restoration methods with sophisticated modules, they struggle with rendering computationally-efficient reconstruction results. Moreover, they usually ignore the reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in medical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight Transformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency domain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer (RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling operations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple inferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM. Additionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial domain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and imaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in the design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging the conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational complexity of naive CA by nearly half. Extensive experimental results in various tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LRformer in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

Deep learning methods offer state-of-the-art performance but often require sensor-specific training when used in a supervised setting. A promising alternative is given by plug-and-play (PnP) methods, which consist in learning only a regularization through a denoiser, allowing to restore images from several sources with the same network. This paper introduces PG-DPIR, an efficient PnP method for high-count Poisson-Gaussian inverse problems, adapted from DPIR. While DPIR is designed for white Gaussian noise, a naive adaptation to Poisson-Gaussian noise leads to prohibitively slow algorithms due to the absence of a closed-form proximal operator. To address this, we adapt DPIR for the specificities of Poisson-Gaussian noise and propose in particular an efficient initialization of the gradient descent required for the proximal step that accelerates convergence by several orders of magnitude. Experiments are conducted on satellite image restoration and super-resolution problems. High-resolution realistic Pleiades images are simulated for the experiments, which demonstrate that PG-DPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency, which seems promising for on-ground satellite processing chains.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we develop a hybrid scale frequency selection block (HSFSBlock), which not only captures multi-scale information from the spatial domain, but also selects the most informative components for image restoration in the frequency domain. Furthermore, to mitigate the inherent noise introduced by skip connections employing only addition or concatenation, we introduce a skip connection attention mechanism (SCAM) to selectively determines the information that should propagate through skip connections. The resulting tightly interlinked architecture, named as LCDNet.

In this paper, we propose a synthetic image generator relying on a few simple principles. In particular, we focus on geometric modeling, textures, and a simple modeling of image acquisition. These properties, integrated in a classical Dead Leaves model, enable the creation of efficient training sets. Standard image denoising and super-resolution networks can be trained on such datasets, reaching performance almost on par with training on natural image datasets. As a first step towards explainability, we provide a careful analysis of the considered principles, identifying which image properties are necessary to obtain good performances. Besides, such training also yields better robustness to various geometric and radiometric perturbations of the test sets.</p></details> |  |

However, the presence of poor quality fundus images caused by factors such as inadequate illumination, noise, blurring and other motion artifacts yields a significant challenge for accurate DR screening. In this study, we propose progressive transfer learning for multi pass restoration to iteratively enhance the quality of degraded fundus images, ensuring more reliable DR screening. Unlike previous methods that often focus on a single pass restoration, multi pass restoration via PTL can achieve a superior blind restoration performance that can even improve most of the good quality fundus images in the dataset. Initially, a Cycle GAN model is trained to restore low quality images, followed by PTL induced restoration passes over the latest restored outputs to improve overall quality in each pass. The proposed method can learn blind restoration without requiring any paired data while surpassing its limitations by leveraging progressive learning and fine tuning strategies to minimize distortions and preserve critical retinal features. To evaluate PTL's effectiveness on multi pass restoration, we conducted experiments on DeepDRiD, a large scale fundus imaging dataset specifically curated for diabetic retinopathy detection.

While adaptive prompt learning enables end-to-end optimization, it often yields overlapping or redundant task representations. Conversely, explicit prompts derived from pretrained classifiers enhance discriminability but may discard critical visual information for reconstruction. To address these limitations, we introduce Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPL), a novel framework that fundamentally enhances prompt-task alignment through two complementary innovations: a \emph{Sparse Prompt Module (SPM)} that efficiently captures degradation-specific features while minimizing redundancy, and a \emph{Contrastive Prompt Regularization (CPR)} that explicitly strengthens task boundaries by incorporating negative prompt samples across different degradation types. Unlike previous approaches that focus primarily on degradation classification, CPL optimizes the critical interaction between prompts and the restoration model itself. Extensive experiments across five comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that CPL consistently enhances state-of-the-art all-in-one restoration models, achieving significant improvements in both standard multi-task scenarios and challenging composite degradation settings.

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs.

However, existing methods rely on predicting and integrating degradation conditions, which can misactivate degradation-specific features in complex scenarios, limiting their restoration performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel all-in-one image restoration framework guided by Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG), named HOGformer. By leveraging the degradation-discriminative capability of HOG descriptors, HOGformer employs a dynamic self-attention mechanism that adaptively attends to long-range spatial dependencies based on degradation-aware HOG cues. To enhance the degradation sensitivity of attention inputs, we design a HOG-guided local dynamic-range convolution module that captures long-range degradation similarities while maintaining awareness of global structural information. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic interaction feed-forward module, efficiently increasing the model capacity to adapt to different degradations through channel-spatial interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks, including adverse weather and natural degradations, demonstrate that HOGformer achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes effectively to complex real-world degradations.

To address this, we introduce ZipIR, a novel framework that enhances efficiency, scalability, and long-range modeling for high-res image restoration. ZipIR employs a highly compressed latent representation that compresses image 32x, effectively reducing the number of spatial tokens, and enabling the use of high-capacity models like the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Toward this goal, we propose a Latent Pyramid VAE (LP-VAE) design that structures the latent space into sub-bands to ease diffusion training. Trained on full images up to 2K resolution, ZipIR surpasses existing diffusion-based methods, offering unmatched speed and quality in restoring high-resolution images from severely degraded inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific degradation scenarios, limiting their adaptability to the diverse and complex challenges in real-world environments. Moreover, real-world degradations are typically non-uniform, highlighting the need for adaptive and intelligent solutions. To address these issues, we propose a novel vision-language-guided universal restoration (VL-UR) framework. VL-UR leverages a zero-shot contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model to enhance image restoration by integrating visual and semantic information. A scene classifier is introduced to adapt CLIP, generating high-quality language embeddings aligned with degraded images while predicting degraded types for complex scenarios. Extensive experiments across eleven diverse degradation settings demonstrate VL-UR's state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and adaptability. This positions VL-UR as a transformative solution for modern image restoration challenges in dynamic, real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we identify two critical issues: feature entropy becoming excessively small and feature magnitudes diverging up to a million-fold scale. We pinpoint the root cause to the per-token normalization aspect of conventional LayerNorm, which disrupts essential spatial correlations and internal feature statistics. To address this, we propose a simple normalization strategy tailored for IR Transformers. Our approach applies normalization across the entire spatio-channel dimension, effectively preserving spatial correlations. Additionally, we introduce an input-adaptive rescaling method that aligns feature statistics to the unique statistical requirements of each input. Experimental results verify that this combined strategy effectively resolves feature divergence, significantly enhancing both the stability and performance of IR Transformers across various IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

In ground-based astronomy, combining multiple exposures to enhance signal-to-noise ratios is further complicated by variations in the point-spread function caused by atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we present a self-supervised multi-frame method, based on deep image priors, for denoising, deblurring, and coadding ground-based exposures. Central to our approach is a carefully designed convolutional neural network that integrates information across multiple observations and enforces physically motivated constraints. We demonstrate the method's potential by processing Hyper Suprime-Cam exposures, yielding promising preliminary results with sharper restored images.</p></details> |  |

OmniLV leverages both textual and visual prompts to offer flexible and user-friendly interactions. Built on Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based generative priors, our framework supports arbitrary resolutions -- achieving optimal performance at 1K resolution -- while preserving fine-grained details and high fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that separately encoding text and visual instructions, combined with co-training using shallow feature control, is essential to mitigate task ambiguity and enhance multi-task generalization. Our findings also reveal that integrating high-level generative tasks into low-level vision models can compromise detail-sensitive restoration. These insights pave the way for more robust and generalizable low-level vision systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent all-in-one frameworks that handle multiple weather degradations within a unified model have shown potential. However, the diversity of degradation patterns across different weather conditions, as well as the complex and varied nature of real-world degradations, pose significant challenges for multiple weather removal. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative diffusion paradigm with degradation-aware adaptive priors for all-in-one weather restoration, termed DA2Diff. It is a new exploration that applies CLIP to perceive degradation-aware properties for better multi-weather restoration. Specifically, we deploy a set of learnable prompts to capture degradation-aware representations by the prompt-image similarity constraints in the CLIP space. By aligning the snowy/hazy/rainy images with snow/haze/rain prompts, each prompt contributes to different weather degradation characteristics. The learned prompts are then integrated into the diffusion model via the designed weather specific prompt guidance module, making it possible to restore multiple weather types. To further improve the adaptiveness to complex weather degradations, we propose a dynamic expert selection modulator that employs a dynamic weather-aware router to flexibly dispatch varying numbers of restoration experts for each weather-distorted image, allowing the diffusion model to restore diverse degradations adaptively. Experimental results substantiate the favorable performance of DA2Diff over state-of-the-arts in quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Source code will be available after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

To produce engaging animations, it is essential to generate coherent multi-shot video clips with narrative scripts and character references. However, existing public datasets primarily focus on real-world scenarios with global descriptions, and lack reference images for consistent character guidance. To bridge this gap, we present AnimeShooter, a reference-guided multi-shot animation dataset. AnimeShooter features comprehensive hierarchical annotations and strong visual consistency across shots through an automated pipeline. Story-level annotations provide an overview of the narrative, including the storyline, key scenes, and main character profiles with reference images, while shot-level annotations decompose the story into consecutive shots, each annotated with scene, characters, and both narrative and descriptive visual captions. Additionally, a dedicated subset, AnimeShooter-audio, offers synchronized audio tracks for each shot, along with audio descriptions and sound sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AnimeShooter and establish a baseline for the reference-guided multi-shot video generation task, we introduce AnimeShooterGen, which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video diffusion models. The reference image and previously generated shots are first processed by MLLM to produce representations aware of both reference and context, which are then used as the condition for the diffusion model to decode the subsequent shot. Experimental results show that the model trained on AnimeShooter achieves superior cross-shot visual consistency and adherence to reference visual guidance, which highlight the value of our dataset for coherent animated video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project released at: https://qiulu66.github.io/animeshooter/</p></details> |

Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)}, where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert specialization in video diffusion model distillation.

Traditionally, these models have been derived using principles of variational inference, denoising, statistical signal processing, and stochastic differential equations. In contrast to the conventional presentation, in this study we derive diffusion models using ideas from linear partial differential equations and demonstrate that this approach has several benefits that include a constructive derivation of the forward and reverse processes, a unified derivation of multiple formulations and sampling strategies, and the discovery of a new class of variance preserving models. We also apply the conditional version of these models to solve canonical conditional density estimation problems and challenging inverse problems. These problems help establish benchmarks for systematically quantifying the performance of different formulations and sampling strategies in this study and for future studies. Finally, we identify and implement a mechanism through which a single diffusion model can be applied to measurements obtained from multiple measurement operators. Taken together, the contents of this manuscript provide a new understanding of and several new directions in the application of diffusion models to solving physics-based inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

While recently proposed conditional diffusion models achieve high fidelity, they typically require hundreds of stochastic sampling steps at inference. We introduce a rectified flow framework that learns a time-dependent velocity field, transporting input to output distributions along nearly straight trajectories. By casting sampling as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) along this straighter flow field, our method makes each integration step much more effective, using as few as eight steps versus (more than) 128 steps in standard score-based diffusion, without sacrificing predictive fidelity. Experiments on challenging multiscale flow benchmarks show that rectified flows recover the same posterior distributions as diffusion models, preserve fine-scale features that MSE-trained baselines miss, and deliver high-resolution samples in a fraction of inference time.</p></details> |  |

Prompt inversion, the task of identifying the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models, which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and unsupervised segmentation.</p></details> |  |

This is the first framework to apply classifier-free guided diffusion to quadruped locomotion and demonstrate its efficacy by extracting goal-conditioned behaviour from an originally unlabelled dataset. We show that these capabilities are compatible with a multi-skill policy and can be applied with little modification and minimal compute overhead, i.e., running entirely on the robots onboard CPU. We verify the validity of our approach with hardware experiments on the ANYmal quadruped platform.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either struggle with effectively learning fine-grained concepts or require a large dataset as input. We propose a dynamic data synthesis pipeline generating diverse part compositions to address one-shot data scarcity. Most importantly, we propose to maximize the mutual information between denoised latents and structured concept codes via a concept predictor, enabling direct regulation on concept disentanglement and re-composition supervision. Our method achieves strong disentanglement and controllable composition, outperforming subject and part-level baselines when mixing concepts from the same, or different, object categories.</p></details> |  |

Generative models, particularly diffusion models, demonstrate exceptional potential in uncertainty quantification for scenario forecasting. Nevertheless, their probabilistic predictive capabilities and conditional bootstrapping mechanisms still remain underexplored. In this paper, a day-ahead probabilistic net load forecasting framework is developed by systematically quantifying epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric variability using the feature-informed enhanced conditional diffusion model (ECDM). The ECDM architecture implements the net load distribution generation process using an imputation-based conditional diffusion model, where multi-modal conditional inputs, such as weather and calendar data, are fused via cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, historical net load profiles are utilized to guide the reverse diffusion trajectory through non-parametric imputation operators preserving spatial-temporal integrity. To capture periodic characteristics, a novel weekly arrangement method is also introduced, while an unconditional model is integrated to ensure diversity in the generated scenarios. Subsequently, the maximum probabilistic points and probability intervals of predicted net load are obtained by the adaptive kernel density estimation under RES intermittency. Moreover, ECDM is extented to multi-energy forecast framework, attempting to increase interpretability of the net load predictions. Numerical experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the superior forecasting performance of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, most astronomical images captured by ground-based telescopes suffer from atmospheric turbulence, resulting in degraded imaging quality. While multi-frame strategies like lucky imaging can mitigate some effects, they involve intensive data acquisition and complex manual processing. In this paper, we propose AstroDiff, a generative restoration method that leverages both the high-quality generative priors and restoration capabilities of diffusion models to mitigate atmospheric turbulence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AstroDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods in astronomical image turbulence mitigation, providing higher perceptual quality and better structural fidelity under severe turbulence conditions.

Therefore, these models are impractical for processing streaming data in real-time. In this work, we adapt a sliding window diffusion framework to the speech enhancement task. Our approach progressively corrupts speech signals through time, assigning more noise to frames close to the present in a buffer. This approach outputs denoised frames with a delay proportional to the chosen buffer size, enabling a trade-off between performance and latency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms standard diffusion models and runs efficiently on a GPU, achieving an input-output latency in the order of 0.3 to 1 seconds.

They rely on a forward and a backward stochastic differential equations (SDE). The sampling of a data distribution is achieved by numerically solving the backward SDE or its associated flow ODE. Studying the convergence of these models necessitates to control four different types of error: the initialization error, the truncation error, the discretization error and the score approximation. In this paper, we theoretically study the behavior of diffusion models and their numerical implementation when the data distribution is Gaussian. Our first contribution is to derive the analytical solutions of the backward SDE and the probability flow ODE and to prove that these solutions and their discretizations are all Gaussian processes. Our second contribution is to compute the exact Wasserstein errors between the target and the numerically sampled distributions for any numerical scheme. This allows us to monitor convergence directly in the data space, while experimental works limit their empirical analysis to Inception features. An implementation of our code is available online.</p></details> |  |

Spleen length measured from 2D ultrasound is the most widely used metric for characterising spleen size. However, it is still considered a surrogate measure, and spleen volume remains the gold standard for assessing spleen size. Accurate spleen volume measurement typically requires 3D imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, but these are not widely available, especially in the Global South which has a high prevalence of SCD. In this work, we introduce a deep learning pipeline, DeepSPV, for precise spleen volume estimation from single or dual 2D ultrasound images. The pipeline involves a segmentation network and a variational autoencoder for learning low-dimensional representations from the estimated segmentations. We investigate three approaches for spleen volume estimation and our best model achieves 86.62%/92.5% mean relative volume accuracy (MRVA) under single-view/dual-view settings, surpassing the performance of human experts. In addition, the pipeline can provide confidence intervals for the volume estimates as well as offering benefits in terms of interpretability, which further support clinicians in decision-making when identifying splenomegaly. We evaluate the full pipeline using a highly realistic synthetic dataset generated by a diffusion model, achieving an overall MRVA of 83.0% from a single 2D ultrasound image. Our proposed DeepSPV is the first work to use deep learning to estimate 3D spleen volume from 2D ultrasound images and can be seamlessly integrated into the current clinical workflow for spleen assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2308.08038</p></details> |

In this paper, we revisit the core principles of CFG and introduce a new method, independent condition guidance (ICG), which provides the benefits of CFG without the need for any special training procedures. Our approach streamlines the training process of conditional diffusion models and can also be applied during inference on any pre-trained conditional model. Additionally, by leveraging the time-step information encoded in all diffusion networks, we propose an extension of CFG, called time-step guidance (TSG), which can be applied to any diffusion model, including unconditional ones. Our guidance techniques are easy to implement and have the same sampling cost as CFG. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICG matches the performance of standard CFG across various conditional diffusion models. Moreover, we show that TSG improves generation quality in a manner similar to CFG, without relying on any conditional information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

While a high guidance scale is generally required to enhance these aspects, it also causes oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we revisit the CFG update rule and introduce modifications to address this issue. We first decompose the update term in CFG into parallel and orthogonal components with respect to the conditional model prediction and observe that the parallel component primarily causes oversaturation, while the orthogonal component enhances image quality. Accordingly, we propose down-weighting the parallel component to achieve high-quality generations without oversaturation. Additionally, we draw a connection between CFG and gradient ascent and introduce a new rescaling and momentum method for the CFG update rule based on this insight. Our approach, termed adaptive projected guidance (APG), retains the quality-boosting advantages of CFG while enabling the use of higher guidance scales without oversaturation. APG is easy to implement and introduces practically no additional computational overhead to the sampling process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that APG is compatible with various conditional diffusion models and samplers, leading to improved FID, recall, and saturation scores while maintaining precision comparable to CFG, making our method a superior plug-and-play alternative to standard classifier-free guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This enables efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without requiring full retraining.

Although substantial resources are expended in collecting and labeling datasets, a critical aspect is often neglected: \textit{preferences vary across individuals and should be represented with more granularity.} To address this, we propose SmPO-Diffusion, a novel method for modeling preference distributions to improve the DPO objective, along with a numerical upper bound estimation for the diffusion optimization objective. First, we introduce a smoothed preference distribution to replace the original binary distribution. We employ a reward model to simulate human preferences and apply preference likelihood averaging to improve the DPO loss, such that the loss function approaches zero when preferences are similar. Furthermore, we utilize an inversion technique to simulate the trajectory preference distribution of the diffusion model, enabling more accurate alignment with the optimization objective.

Existing approaches exhibit critical limitations: motion graph methods rely on fixed template libraries, restricting creative generation; diffusion models, while capable of producing novel motions, often lack temporal coherence and musical alignment. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{MotionRAG-Diff}$, a hybrid framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with diffusion-based refinement to enable high-quality, musically coherent dance generation for arbitrary long-term music inputs. Our method introduces three core innovations: (1) A cross-modal contrastive learning architecture that aligns heterogeneous music and dance representations in a shared latent space, establishing unsupervised semantic correspondence without paired data; (2) An optimized motion graph system for efficient retrieval and seamless concatenation of motion segments, ensuring realism and temporal coherence across long sequences; (3) A multi-condition diffusion model that jointly conditions on raw music signals and contrastive features to enhance motion quality and global synchronization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionRAG-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion quality, diversity, and music-motion synchronization accuracy. This work establishes a new paradigm for music-driven dance generation by synergizing retrieval-based template fidelity with diffusion-based creative enhancement.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

By integrating the Mamba network architecture with the diffusion model, the condition network achieves refined conditional control, thereby enhancing the control and optimization of the image generation process. To evaluate the robustness and generalization capability of our method across various image degradation conditions, extensive experiments were conducted on several benchmark datasets, including Rain100H, Rain100L, GoPro, and SSID. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently surpasses existing methods in perceptual quality metrics, such as LPIPS and FID, while maintaining comparable performance in image distortion metrics, including PSNR and SSIM, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability. Notably, ablation experiments reveal that directly noise prediction in the diffusion process achieves better performance, effectively balancing noise suppression and detail preservation. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the Mamba architecture is particularly well-suited as a conditional control network for diffusion models, outperforming both CNN- and Attention-based approaches in this context. Overall, these results highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of ControlMambaIR in addressing a range of image restoration perceptual challenges.</p></details> |  |

The potential and fidelity in iris image generation of each method is discussed and examples of inferred predictions are provided. Furthermore, the risks of individual biometric features leakage from the training sets are considered, together with possible strategies for preventing them, which have to be implemented should these generative methods be considered a valid replacement of real-world biometric datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperspectral Image Generation with Unmixing Guided Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02601v1)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.02601v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, hyperspectral image generation has received increasing attention, but existing generative models rely on conditional generation schemes, which limits the diversity of generated images. Diffusion models are popular for their ability to generate high-quality samples, but adapting these models from RGB to hyperspectral data presents the challenge of high dimensionality and physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion model guided by hyperspectral unmixing. Our model comprises two key modules: an unmixing autoencoder module and an abundance diffusion module. The unmixing autoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task from the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity. The abundance diffusion module generates samples that satisfy the constraints of non-negativity and unity, ensuring the physical consistency of the reconstructed HSIs. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored to hyperspectral data. Empirical results, evaluated using both traditional metrics and our proposed metrics, indicate that our model is capable of generating high-quality and diverse hyperspectral images, offering an advancement in hyperspectral data generation.</p></details> |  |

Inversion within these models aims to recover the latent noise representation for a real or generated image, enabling reconstruction, editing, and other downstream tasks. However, to date, most inversion approaches suffer from an intrinsic trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and editing flexibility. This limitation arises from the difficulty of maintaining both semantic alignment and structural consistency during the inversion process. In this work, we introduce Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI), a novel framework that jointly conditions on the source prompt and reference image to guide the inversion process. Specifically, DCI formulates the inversion process as a dual-condition fixed-point optimization problem, minimizing both the latent noise gap and the reconstruction error under the joint guidance. This design anchors the inversion trajectory in both semantic and visual space, leading to more accurate and editable latent representations. Our novel setup brings new understanding to the inversion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCI achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple editing tasks, significantly improving both reconstruction quality and editing precision. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method achieves strong results in reconstruction tasks, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability approaching the ultimate goal of the inversion process.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency via multimodal control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the new large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion models. Leveraging five of the latest digital human generation methods and a voice cloning method, we systematically construct a dataset comprising 60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data diversity and realism. User studies demonstrate that the misrecognition rate by participants for DigiFakeAV reaches as high as 68%. Moreover, the substantial performance degradation of existing detection models on our dataset further highlights its challenges. To address this problem, we propose DigiShield, an effective detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the DigiFakeAV and shows strong generalization on other datasets.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances, synthesizing temporally coherent and visually compelling long sequences remains a formidable challenge. Conventional approaches often synthesize long videos by sequentially generating and concatenating short clips, or generating key frames and then interpolate the intermediate frames in a hierarchical manner. However, both of them still remain significant challenges, leading to issues such as temporal repetition or unnatural transitions. In this paper, we revisit the hierarchical long video generation pipeline and introduce LumosFlow, a framework introduce motion guidance explicitly. Specifically, we first employ the Large Motion Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (LMTV-DM) to generate key frames with larger motion intervals, thereby ensuring content diversity in the generated long videos. Given the complexity of interpolating contextual transitions between key frames, we further decompose the intermediate frame interpolation into motion generation and post-hoc refinement. For each pair of key frames, the Latent Optical Flow Diffusion Model (LOF-DM) synthesizes complex and large-motion optical flows, while MotionControlNet subsequently refines the warped results to enhance quality and guide intermediate frame generation. Compared with traditional video frame interpolation, we achieve 15x interpolation, ensuring reasonable and continuous motion between adjacent frames. Experiments show that our method can generate long videos with consistent motion and appearance. Code and models will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

However, most works in the literature focus on analyzing it only from an ethical perspective, focusing on moral principles and values that should be considered in the design and evaluation of algorithms, while disregarding the epistemic dimension related to knowledge transmission and validation. However, this aspect of algorithmic fairness should also be included in the debate, as it is crucial to introduce a specific type of harm: an individual may be systematically excluded from the dissemination of knowledge due to the attribution of a credibility deficit/excess. In this work, we specifically focus on characterizing and analyzing the impact of this credibility deficit or excess on the diffusion of innovations on a societal scale, a phenomenon driven by individual attitudes and social interactions, and also by the strength of mutual connections. Indeed, discrimination might shape the latter, ultimately modifying how innovations spread within the network. In this light, to incorporate, also from a formal point of view, the epistemic dimension in innovation diffusion models becomes paramount, especially if these models are intended to support fair policy design. For these reasons, we formalize the epistemic properties of a social environment, by extending the well-established Linear Threshold Model (LTM) in an epistemic direction to show the impact of epistemic biases in innovation diffusion. Focusing on the impact of epistemic bias in both open-loop and closed-loop scenarios featuring optimal fostering policies, our results shed light on the pivotal role the epistemic dimension might have in the debate of algorithmic fairness in decision-making.</p></details> |  |

While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements, exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full (complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice, Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$, outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$ speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing quality.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, humans can often disentangle shape and material, and when they are uncertain, they often move their head slightly or rotate the object to help resolve the ambiguities. Inspired by this behavior, we introduce a novel conditional denoising-diffusion model that generates samples of shape-and-material maps from a short video of an object undergoing differential motions. Our parameter-efficient architecture allows training directly in pixel-space, and it generates many disentangled attributes of an object simultaneously. Trained on a modest number of synthetic object-motion videos with supervision on shape and material, the model exhibits compelling emergent behavior: For static observations, it produces diverse, multimodal predictions of plausible shape-and-material maps that capture the inherent ambiguities; and when objects move, the distributions quickly converge to more accurate explanations. The model also produces high-quality shape-and-material estimates for less ambiguous, real-world objects. By moving beyond single-view to continuous motion observations, our work suggests a generative perception approach for improving visual reasoning in physically-embodied systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DC-ControlNet: Decoupling Inter- and Intra-Element Conditions in Image Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14779v2)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.14779v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce DC (Decouple)-ControlNet, a highly flexible and precisely controllable framework for multi-condition image generation. The core idea behind DC-ControlNet is to decouple control conditions, transforming global control into a hierarchical system that integrates distinct elements, contents, and layouts. This enables users to mix these individual conditions with greater flexibility, leading to more efficient and accurate image generation control. Previous ControlNet-based models rely solely on global conditions, which affect the entire image and lack the ability of element- or region-specific control. This limitation reduces flexibility and can cause condition misunderstandings in multi-conditional image generation. To address these challenges, we propose both intra-element and Inter-element Controllers in DC-ControlNet. The Intra-Element Controller handles different types of control signals within individual elements, accurately describing the content and layout characteristics of the object. For interactions between elements, we introduce the Inter-Element Controller, which accurately handles multi-element interactions and occlusion based on user-defined relationships. Extensive evaluations show that DC-ControlNet significantly outperforms existing ControlNet models and Layout-to-Image generative models in terms of control flexibility and precision in multi-condition control.

This mismatch mirrors biological morphogenesis where developmental phases demand distinct genetic programs. Inspired by epigenetic regulation governing morphological specialization, we propose **(ANT)**, an **A**daptive **N**eural **T**emporal-Aware architecture. ANT orchestrates semantic granularity through: **(i) Semantic Temporally Adaptive (STA) Module:** Automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency structural planning and high-frequency refinement via spectral analysis. **(ii) Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling (DCFG):** Adaptively adjusts conditional to unconditional ratio enhancing efficiency while maintaining fidelity. **(iii) Temporal-semantic reweighting:** Quantitatively aligns text influence with phase requirements. Extensive experiments show that ANT can be applied to various baselines, significantly improving model performance, and achieving state-of-the-art semantic alignment on StableMoFusion.</p></details> |  |

Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce Shallow Diffuse, a new watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, Shallow Diffuse decouples these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments further validate that our Shallow Diffuse outperforms existing watermarking methods in terms of robustness and consistency. The codes will be released at https://github.com/liwd190019/Shallow-Diffuse.</p></details> |  |

However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility. Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency. Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences, with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

These models have demonstrated significant ability to translate between the SMILES encodings of chemical products and reactants, but are constrained as a result of their autoregressive nature. We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method for retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which allows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We construct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art performance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3, top-5, and top-10 accuracy among template-free methods. We prove that DiffER is a strong baseline for a new class of template-free model, capable of learning a variety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings and outperforming a variety of other template-free methods on top-k accuracy metrics. By constructing an ensemble of categorical diffusion models with a novel length prediction component with variance, our method is able to approximately sample from the posterior distribution of reactants, producing results with strong metrics of confidence and likelihood. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate that accurate prediction of the SMILES sequence length is key to further boosting the performance of categorical diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion (LWD), a lightweight framework that enables any latent diffusion model to scale to ultra-high-resolution image generation (2K to 4K) for free. LWD introduces three key components: (1) a scale-consistent variational autoencoder objective that enhances the spectral fidelity of latent representations; (2) wavelet energy maps that identify and localize detail-rich spatial regions within the latent space; and (3) a time-dependent masking strategy that focuses denoising supervision on high-frequency components during training. LWD requires no architectural modifications and incurs no additional computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, it consistently improves perceptual quality and reduces FID in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, outperforming strong baseline models. These results highlight the effectiveness of frequency-aware, signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient approach for high-resolution generative modeling.</p></details> |  |

We find that off-the-shelf diffusion models, trained exclusively to generate natural RGB images, can identify semantically meaningful correspondences in medical images. Building on this observation, we propose to leverage diffusion model features as a similarity measure to guide deformable image registration networks. We show that common intensity-based similarity losses often fail in challenging scenarios, such as when certain anatomies are visible in one image but absent in another, leading to anatomically inaccurate alignments. In contrast, our method identifies true semantic correspondences, aligning meaningful structures while disregarding those not present across images.

This framework can accommodate different forward models without re-training while preserving the generative capability of diffusion models. Despite their success in many imaging inverse problems, most existing methods rely on privileged information such as derivative, pseudo-inverse, or full knowledge about the forward model. This reliance poses a substantial limitation that restricts their use in a wide range of problems where such information is unavailable, such as in many scientific applications. We propose Ensemble Kalman Diffusion Guidance (EnKG), a derivative-free approach that can solve inverse problems by only accessing forward model evaluations and a pre-trained diffusion model prior. We study the empirical effectiveness of EnKG across various inverse problems, including scientific settings such as inferring fluid flows and astronomical objects, which are highly non-linear inverse problems that often only permit black-box access to the forward model.

Existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) datasets overlook the brightness relationship between day and night, resulting in the brightness mapping being inconsistent with the real world during image synthesis; and (2) models do not explicitly incorporate daytime brightness knowledge, limiting their ability to reconstruct realistic lighting. To address these challenges, we introduce the Diffusion-Based Nighttime Dehazing (DiffND) framework, which excels in both data synthesis and lighting reconstruction. Our approach starts with a data synthesis pipeline that simulates severe distortions while enforcing brightness consistency between synthetic and real-world scenes, providing a strong foundation for learning night-to-day brightness mapping. Next, we propose a restoration model that integrates a pre-trained diffusion model guided by a brightness perception network. This design harnesses the diffusion model's generative ability while adapting it to nighttime dehazing through brightness-aware optimization. Experiments validate our dataset's utility and the model's superior performance in joint haze removal and brightness mapping.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the probabilistic reward task from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study, we propose a novel framework that integrates the reinforcement learning (RL) model and drift-diffusion model (DDM) to jointly analyze reward-based decision-making with response times. To account for emerging evidence suggesting that decision-making may alternate between multiple interleaved strategies, we model latent state switching using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In the ''engaged'' state, decisions follow an RL-DDM, simultaneously capturing reward processing, decision dynamics, and temporal structure. In contrast, in the ''lapsed'' state, decision-making is modeled using a simplified DDM, where specific parameters are fixed to approximate random guessing with equal probability. The proposed method is implemented using a computationally efficient generalized expectation-maximization algorithm with forward-backward procedures. Through extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms competing approaches under various reward-generating distributions, both with and without strategy switching. When applied to the EMBARC study, our framework reveals that MDD patients exhibit lower overall engagement than healthy controls and experience longer decision times when they do engage. Additionally, we show that neuroimaging measures of brain activities are associated with decision-making characteristics in the ''engaged'' state but not in the ''lapsed'' state, providing evidence of brain-behavioral association specific to the ''engaged'' state.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, the task of concept erasure has been introduced, aiming to erase any undesired concepts that the models can generate. Previous methods, whether training-based or training-free, have primarily focused on the input side, i.e., texts. However, they often suffer from incomplete erasure due to limitations in the generalization from limited prompts to diverse image content. In this paper, motivated by the notion that concept erasure on the output side, i.e., generated images, may be more direct and effective, we propose Concept Corrector. It checks target concepts based on visual features provided by final generated images predicted at certain time steps. Further, it incorporates Concept Removal Attention to erase generated concept features. It overcomes the limitations of existing methods, which are either unable to remove the concept features that have been generated in images or rely on the assumption that the related concept words are contained in input prompts. In the whole pipeline, our method changes no model parameters and only requires a given target concept as well as the corresponding replacement content, which is easy to implement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first erasure method based on intermediate-generated images, achieving the ability to erase concepts on the fly. The experiments on various concepts demonstrate its impressive erasure performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the theoretical understanding of FM models, particularly how their sample trajectories interact with underlying data geometry, remains underexplored. A rigorous theoretical analysis of FM ODE is essential for sample quality, stability, and broader applicability. In this paper, we advance the theory of FM models through a comprehensive analysis of sample trajectories. Central to our theory is the discovery that the denoiser, a key component of FM models, guides ODE dynamics through attracting and absorbing behaviors that adapt to the data geometry. We identify and analyze the three stages of ODE evolution: in the initial and intermediate stages, trajectories move toward the mean and local clusters of the data. At the terminal stage, we rigorously establish the convergence of FM ODE under weak assumptions, addressing scenarios where the data lie on a low-dimensional submanifold-cases that previous results could not handle.

While recent methods utilizing consistency-based distillation aim to achieve few-step or single-step inference, their one-step performance is constrained by curved trajectories, preventing them from surpassing traditional diffusion models. In this work, we introduce FlashAudio with rectified flows to learn straight flow for fast simulation. To alleviate the inefficient timesteps allocation and suboptimal distribution of noise, FlashAudio optimizes the time distribution of rectified flow with Bifocal Samplers and proposes immiscible flow to minimize the total distance of data-noise pairs in a batch vias assignment. Furthermore, to address the amplified accumulation error caused by the classifier-free guidance (CFG), we propose Anchored Optimization, which refines the guidance scale by anchoring it to a reference trajectory. Experimental results on text-to-audio generation demonstrate that FlashAudio's one-step generation performance surpasses the diffusion-based models with hundreds of sampling steps on audio quality and enables a sampling speed of 400x faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA 4090Ti GPU.

| **[Rethinking Diffusion Posterior Sampling: From Conditional Score Estimator to Maximizing a Posterior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18913v2)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.18913v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have been leveraged to address inverse problems without additional training, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) (Chung et al., 2022a) is among the most popular approaches. Previous analyses suggest that DPS accomplishes posterior sampling by approximating the conditional score. While in this paper, we demonstrate that the conditional score approximation employed by DPS is not as effective as previously assumed, but rather aligns more closely with the principle of maximizing a posterior (MAP). This assertion is substantiated through an examination of DPS on 512x512 ImageNet images, revealing that: 1) DPS's conditional score estimation significantly diverges from the score of a well-trained conditional diffusion model and is even inferior to the unconditional score; 2) The mean of DPS's conditional score estimation deviates significantly from zero, rendering it an invalid score estimation; 3) DPS generates high-quality samples with significantly lower diversity. In light of the above findings, we posit that DPS more closely resembles MAP than a conditional score estimator, and accordingly propose the following enhancements to DPS: 1) we explicitly maximize the posterior through multi-step gradient ascent and projection; 2) we utilize a light-weighted conditional score estimator trained with only 100 images and 8 GPU hours. Extensive experimental results indicate that these proposed improvements significantly enhance DPS's performance. The source code for these improvements is provided in https://github.com/tongdaxu/Rethinking-Diffusion-Posterior-Sampling-From-Conditional-Score-Estimator-to-Maximizing-a-Posterior.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) works well in standard settings, it fails under aggressive sampling step compression due to divergent predictions between positive and negative branches. We present Normalized Attention Guidance (NAG), an efficient, training-free mechanism that applies extrapolation in attention space with L1-based normalization and refinement. NAG restores effective negative guidance where CFG collapses while maintaining fidelity. Unlike existing approaches, NAG generalizes across architectures (UNet, DiT), sampling regimes (few-step, multi-step), and modalities (image, video), functioning as a \textit{universal} plug-in with minimal computational overhead. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate consistent improvements in text alignment (CLIP Score), fidelity (FID, PFID), and human-perceived quality (ImageReward). Our ablation studies validate each design component, while user studies confirm significant preference for NAG-guided outputs. As a model-agnostic inference-time approach requiring no retraining, NAG provides effortless negative guidance for all modern diffusion frameworks -- pseudocode in the Appendix!</p></details> |  |

Using a reference video and conditional signals such as music or motion tags, the system synthesizes new videos by first retrieving video clips with gestures matching the conditions and then generating interpolation frames to seamlessly connect clip boundaries. The core of our approach is HMInterp, a robust Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) model that enables seamless interpolation of discontinuous frames, even for complex motion scenarios like dancing. HMInterp i) employs a dual-branch interpolation approach, combining a Motion Diffusion Model for human skeleton motion interpolation with a diffusion-based video frame interpolation model for final frame generation. ii) adopts condition progressive training to effectively leverage identity strong and weak conditions, such as images and pose. These designs ensure both high video texture quality and accurate motion trajectory. Results show that our Video Motion Graphs outperforms existing generative- and retrieval-based methods for multi-modal conditioned human motion video generation.

This challenge is compounded by the models' tendency to memorize training data, raising privacy concerns. SFBD (Lu et al., 2025) addresses this by training on corrupted data and using limited clean samples to capture local structure and improve convergence. However, its iterative denoising and fine-tuning loop requires manual coordination, making it burdensome to implement. We reinterpret SFBD as an alternating projection algorithm and introduce a continuous variant, SFBD flow, that removes the need for alternating steps. We further show its connection to consistency constraint-based methods, and demonstrate that its practical instantiation, Online SFBD, consistently outperforms strong baselines across benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have shown promise in generative tasks, their ability to maintain strict pose alignment throughout the diffusion process is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Iterative Homography Adjustment (IHA) scheme applied during the denoising process, which effectively addresses pose misalignment and ensures spatial consistency in the generated street-view images. Additionally, currently, available datasets for satellite-to-street-view generation are limited in their diversity of illumination and weather conditions, thereby restricting the generalizability of the generated outputs. To mitigate this, we introduce a text-guided illumination and weather-controlled sampling strategy that enables fine-grained control over the environmental factors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly improves pose accuracy and enhances the diversity and realism of generated street-view images, setting a new benchmark for satellite-to-street-view generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) is a recently proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline. We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image generation through activation addition. We find that ITDA has comparable interpretability to SAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, Mechanistic Interpretability for Vision at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

A proposed remedy is to train exclusively on noisy data with potential copyright issues, ensuring the model never observes original content. However, through the lens of deconvolution theory, we show that although it is theoretically feasible to learn the data distribution from noisy samples, the practical challenge of collecting sufficient samples makes successful learning nearly unattainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose to pretrain the model with a small fraction of clean data to guide the deconvolution process. Combined with our Stochastic Forward--Backward Deconvolution (SFBD) method, we attain FID 6.31 on CIFAR-10 with just 4% clean images (and 3.58 with 10%). We also provide theoretical guarantees that SFBD learns the true data distribution. These results underscore the value of limited clean pretraining, or pretraining on similar datasets. Empirical studies further validate and enrich our findings.</p></details> |  |

A prominent approach involves synchronizing multiple diffusion trajectories by mixing the estimated scores to artificially correlate the generation processes. However, existing methods rely on naive heuristics, such as averaging, without considering task specificity. These approaches do not clarify why such methods work and often produce suboptimal results when a heuristic suitable for one task is blindly applied to others. In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework for analyzing why diffusion synchronization works and reveal where heuristics should be focused; modeling correlations between multiple trajectories and adapting them to each specific task. We further identify optimal correlation models per task, achieving better results than previous approaches that apply a single heuristic across all tasks without justification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR2025.

It has also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably, convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization that removes the need of early-stopping.</p></details> |  |

Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, their use in jointly optimized latent variable models remains unexplored as they require direct access to the samples from the two distributions. This work presents Latent Stochastic Interpolants (LSI) enabling joint learning in a latent space with end-to-end optimized encoder, decoder and latent SI models. We achieve this by developing a principled Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objective derived directly in continuous time. The joint optimization allows LSI to learn effective latent representations along with a generative process that transforms an arbitrary prior distribution into the encoder-defined aggregated posterior. LSI sidesteps the simple priors of the normal diffusion models and mitigates the computational demands of applying SI directly in high-dimensional observation spaces, while preserving the generative flexibility of the SI framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of LSI through comprehensive experiments on the standard large scale ImageNet generation benchmark.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, current foundation FM models are computationally prohibitive for finetuning, while diffusion models like Stable Diffusion benefit from efficient architectures and ecosystem support. This work addresses the critical challenge of efficiently transferring knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models to flow matching. We propose Diff2Flow, a novel framework that systematically bridges diffusion and FM paradigms by rescaling timesteps, aligning interpolants, and deriving FM-compatible velocity fields from diffusion predictions. This alignment enables direct and efficient FM finetuning of diffusion priors with no extra computation overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that Diff2Flow outperforms na\"ive FM and diffusion finetuning particularly under parameter-efficient constraints, while achieving superior or competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, current image editing largely overlooks multi-object scenarios, where precise control over object categories, counts, and spatial layouts remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a new task, quantity-and-layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit), which aims to enable fine-grained control of object quantity and spatial structure in complex scenes. We further propose IMAGHarmony, a structure-aware framework that incorporates harmony-aware attention (HA) to integrate multimodal semantics, explicitly modeling object counts and layouts to enhance editing accuracy and structural consistency. In addition, we observe that diffusion models are susceptible to initial noise and exhibit strong preferences for specific noise patterns. Motivated by this, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that chooses semantically aligned initial noise samples based on vision-language matching, thereby improving generation stability and layout consistency in multi-object editing. To support evaluation, we construct HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural alignment and semantic accuracy.

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution,current methods struggle to simultaneously achieve stable, efficient fine-tuning and support non-differentiable rewards. Furthermore, their reliance on sparse rewards provides inadequate supervision during intermediate steps, often resulting in suboptimal generation quality. To address these limitations, dense and differentiable signals are required throughout the diffusion process. Hence, we propose VAlue-based Reinforced Diffusion (VARD): a novel approach that first learns a value function predicting expection of rewards from intermediate states, and subsequently uses this value function with KL regularization to provide dense supervision throughout the generation process. Our method maintains proximity to the pretrained model while enabling effective and stable training via backpropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates better trajectory guidance, improves training efficiency and extends the applicability of RL to diffusion models optimized for complex, non-differentiable reward functions.</p></details> | Under review |

However, they often fail to produce semantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations that contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual contradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled associations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware prompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a sequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the semantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while ensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify contradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original intent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information with the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic control and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual contradictions.

Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships, TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors, facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation.

Despite their remarkable success in generating high-quality images, the internal mechanisms of the underlying score networks are not well understood. Here, we examine a UNet trained for denoising on the ImageNet dataset, to better understand its internal representation and computation of the score. We show that the middle block of the UNet decomposes individual images into sparse subsets of active channels, and that the vector of spatial averages of these channels can provide a nonlinear representation of the underlying clean images. We develop a novel algorithm for stochastic reconstruction of images from this representation and demonstrate that it recovers a sample from a set of images defined by a target image representation. We then study the properties of the representation and demonstrate that Euclidean distances in the latent space correspond to distances between conditional densities induced by representations as well as semantic similarities in the image space. Applying a clustering algorithm in the representation space yields groups of images that share both fine details (e.g., specialized features, textured regions, small objects), as well as global structure, but are only partially aligned with object identities. Thus, we show for the first time that a network trained solely on denoising contains a rich and accessible sparse representation of images.</p></details> |  |

Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects. Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views, while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted exploration.

The effectiveness of these methods hinges on two essential elements: (1) the use of massively parallel physics simulations to expedite policy training, and (2) an environment generator tasked with crafting sufficiently challenging yet attainable environments to facilitate continuous policy improvement. Existing methods of outdoor environment generation often rely on heuristics constrained by a set of parameters, limiting the diversity and realism. In this work, we introduce ADEPT, a novel \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{E}nvironment for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{T}ransfer in the zero-shot sim-to-real fashion that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to dynamically expand existing training environments by adding more diverse and complex environments adaptive to the current policy. ADEPT guides the diffusion model's generation process through initial noise optimization, blending noise-corrupted environments from existing training environments weighted by the policy's performance in each corresponding environment. By manipulating the noise corruption level, ADEPT seamlessly transitions between generating similar environments for policy fine-tuning and novel ones to expand training diversity. To benchmark ADEPT in off-road navigation, we propose a fast and effective multi-layer map representation for wild environment generation. Our experiments show that the policy trained by ADEPT outperforms both procedural generated and natural environments, along with popular navigation methods.</p></details> |  |

Many existing methods focus on training a model for a specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V), video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However, training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch. Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes (8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines. Our models and source codes are available at https://github.com/leeruibin/MfM.git.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, in current ControlNet training, each control is designed to influence all areas of an image, which can lead to conflicts when different control signals are expected to manage different parts of the image in practical applications. This issue is especially pronounced with edge-type control conditions, where regions lacking boundary information often represent low-frequency signals, referred to as silent control signals. When combining multiple ControlNets, these silent control signals can suppress the generation of textures in related areas, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this problem, we propose Minimal Impact ControlNet. Our approach mitigates conflicts through three key strategies: constructing a balanced dataset, combining and injecting feature signals in a balanced manner, and addressing the asymmetry in the score function's Jacobian matrix induced by ControlNet. These improvements enhance the compatibility of control signals, allowing for freer and more harmonious generation in areas with silent control signals.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Today's state-of-the-art methods achieve low compilation error by combining search algorithms with gradient-based parameter optimization, but they incur long runtimes and require multiple calls to quantum hardware or expensive classical simulations, making their scaling prohibitive. Recently, machine-learning models have emerged as an alternative, though they are currently restricted to discrete gate sets. Here, we introduce a multimodal denoising diffusion model that simultaneously generates a circuit's structure and its continuous parameters for compiling a target unitary. It leverages two independent diffusion processes, one for discrete gate selection and one for parameter prediction. We benchmark the model over different experiments, analyzing the method's accuracy across varying qubit counts, circuit depths, and proportions of parameterized gates. Finally, by exploiting its rapid circuit generation, we create large datasets of circuits for particular operations and use these to extract valuable heuristics that can help us discover new insights into quantum circuit synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Text: 10 pages and 5 figures; Appendix: 17 pages, 7 figures and 1 table.

These fabricated videos are indistinguishable from real ones, increasing the risk of potential misuse for scams, political manipulation, and misinformation. Hence, addressing these ethical concerns has become a pressing issue in AI security. Recent proactive defense studies focused on countering LDM-based models by adding perturbations to portraits. However, these methods are ineffective at protecting reference portraits from advanced image-to-video animation. The limitations are twofold: 1) they fail to prevent images from being manipulated by audio signals, and 2) diffusion-based purification techniques can effectively eliminate protective perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose Silencer, a two-stage method designed to proactively protect the privacy of portraits. First, a nullifying loss is proposed to ignore audio control in talking-head generation. Second, we apply anti-purification loss in LDM to optimize the inverted latent feature to generate robust perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Silencer in proactively protecting portrait privacy. We hope this work will raise awareness among the AI security community regarding critical ethical issues related to talking-head generation techniques.

This paper introduces an innovative multi-modal watermarking approach, drawing on the concept of vector discretization in encoder-based vector quantization. By constructing adjacency matrices, the proposed method enables the transformation of text watermarks into robust image-based representations, providing a novel multi-modal watermarking paradigm for image generation applications. Additionally, this study presents a newly designed image restoration module to mitigate image degradation caused by transmission losses and various noise interferences, thereby ensuring the reliability and integrity of the watermark. Experimental results validate the robustness of the method under multiple noise attacks, providing a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for digital image copyright protection.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for human-object interaction often neglect scene context, leading to implausible penetrations, while human-scene interaction approaches struggle to coordinate fine-grained manipulations with long-range navigation. To address these limitations, we propose HOSIG, a novel framework for synthesizing full-body interactions through hierarchical scene perception. Our method decouples the task into three key components: 1) a scene-aware grasp pose generator that ensures collision-free whole-body postures with precise hand-object contact by integrating local geometry constraints, 2) a heuristic navigation algorithm that autonomously plans obstacle-avoiding paths in complex indoor environments via compressed 2D floor maps and dual-component spatial reasoning, and 3) a scene-guided motion diffusion model that generates trajectory-controlled, full-body motions with finger-level accuracy by incorporating spatial anchors and dual-space classifier-free guidance. Extensive experiments on the TRUMANS dataset demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework supports unlimited motion length through autoregressive generation and requires minimal manual intervention. This work bridges the critical gap between scene-aware navigation and dexterous object manipulation, advancing the frontier of embodied interaction synthesis.

MCTG integrates classifier-based rewards with search-tree expansion, overcoming gradient estimation challenges and data sparsity. Using PepTune, we generate diverse, chemically-modified peptides simultaneously optimized for multiple therapeutic properties, including target binding affinity, membrane permeability, solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling for various disease-relevant targets.

Our system introduces structured prompting with confidence scoring, fallback behaviors, and social context awareness to enable intention refinement and adaptive response. Leveraging large-scale motion datasets and efficient latent-space denoising, the framework generates diverse, physically plausible gestures suitable for dynamic humanoid interactions.

Existing scene text removal models require complex annotation and retraining, and may leave faint yet recognizable text information, compromising privacy protection and content concealment. TextDestroyer addresses these issues by employing a three-stage hierarchical process to obtain accurate text masks. Our method scrambles text areas in the latent start code using a Gaussian distribution before reconstruction. During the diffusion denoising process, self-attention key and value are referenced from the original latent to restore the compromised background. Latent codes saved at each inversion step are used for replacement during reconstruction, ensuring perfect background restoration. The advantages of TextDestroyer include: (1) it eliminates labor-intensive data annotation and resource-intensive training; (2) it achieves more thorough text destruction, preventing recognizable traces; and (3) it demonstrates better generalization capabilities, performing well on both real-world scenes and generated images.</p></details> |  |

Contrary to the majority of work that views diffusion samplers as approximations to an underlying continuous-time model, we view diffusion models as discrete-time policies trained to produce samples in very few generation steps. We propose to trade some of the elegance of the underlying theory for flexibility in the definition of the generative and destruction policies. In particular, we decouple the generation and destruction variances, enabling both transition kernels to be learned as unconstrained Gaussian densities. We show that, when the number of steps is limited, training both generation and destruction processes results in faster convergence and improved sampling quality on various benchmarks. Through a robust ablation study, we investigate the design choices necessary to facilitate stable training. Finally, we show the scalability of our approach through experiments on GAN latent space sampling for conditional image generation.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we exploit the pattern discrepancies between original images and mask-conditional generated images to facilitate a coarse-to-fine segmentation refinement by establishing a semantic correspondence alignment and updating the foreground probability. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our plug-and-play design, underscoring the potential of leveraging generation discrepancies to model dense representations and encouraging further exploration of generative approaches for solving discriminative tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo 2025</p></details> |

However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that schedules where the TV explodes exponentially can often be improved by adopting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the generation performance. Our findings hold across various reverse diffusion solvers and diverse applications, including molecular structure and image generation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel perspective: framing unrestricted adversarial example generation as a problem of aligning with adversary preferences. Unlike benign alignment, adversarial alignment involves two inherently conflicting preferences: visual consistency and attack effectiveness, which often lead to unstable optimization and reward hacking (e.g., reducing visual quality to improve attack success). To address this, we propose APA (Adversary Preferences Alignment), a two-stage framework that decouples conflicting preferences and optimizes each with differentiable rewards. In the first stage, APA fine-tunes LoRA to improve visual consistency using rule-based similarity reward. In the second stage, APA updates either the image latent or prompt embedding based on feedback from a substitute classifier, guided by trajectory-level and step-wise rewards. To enhance black-box transferability, we further incorporate a diffusion augmentation strategy. Experiments demonstrate that APA achieves significantly better attack transferability while maintaining high visual consistency, inspiring further research to approach adversarial attacks from an alignment perspective.

We propose integrating Schr\"odinger Bridge with GANs to effectively mitigate this issue, achieving high-quality outputs on full-band datasets while substantially reducing the required sampling steps.

However, generating high frame-rate (FPS) videos remains a significant challenge due to issues such as flickering and degradation in long sequences, particularly in fast-motion scenarios. Existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiencies and limitations in maintaining video quality over extended frames. In this paper, we present a novel, training-free approach for high FPS video generation using pre-trained diffusion models. Our method, DiffuseSlide, introduces a new pipeline that leverages key frames from low FPS videos and applies innovative techniques, including noise re-injection and sliding window latent denoising, to achieve smooth, consistent video outputs without the need for additional fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves video quality, offering enhanced temporal coherence and spatial fidelity. The proposed method is not only computationally efficient but also adaptable to various video generation tasks, making it ideal for applications such as virtual reality, video games, and high-quality content creation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world food images often show a skewed distribution, with some food types being more prevalent than others. This class imbalance can be problematic, causing models to favor the majority (head) classes with overall performance degradation for the less common (tail) classes. Recently, synthetic data augmentation using diffusion-based generative models has emerged as a promising solution to address this issue. By generating high-quality synthetic images, these models can help uniformize the data distribution, potentially improving classification performance. However, existing approaches face challenges: fine-tuning-based methods need a uniformly distributed dataset, while pre-trained model-based approaches often overlook inter-class separation in synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a two-stage synthetic data augmentation framework, leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for long-tailed food classification. We generate a reference set conditioned by a positive prompt on the generation target and then select a class that shares similar features with the generation target as a negative prompt. Subsequently, we generate a synthetic augmentation set using positive and negative prompt conditions by a combined sampling strategy that promotes intra-class diversity and inter-class separation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on two long-tailed food benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance compared to previous works in terms of top-1 accuracy.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Traditionally, this initial state is sampled from a simple, fixed distribution like isotropic Gaussian, inherently lacking structure and a direct mechanism for external control. While recent efforts have explored ways to introduce controllability into the diffusion process, particularly at the initialization stage, they often rely on deterministic or heuristic approaches. These methods can be suboptimal, lack expressiveness, and are difficult to scale or integrate into more sophisticated optimization frameworks. In this paper, we introduce NoiseAR, a novel method for AutoRegressive Initial Noise Prior for Diffusion Models. Instead of a static, unstructured source, NoiseAR learns to generate a dynamic and controllable prior distribution for the initial noise. We formulate the generation of the initial noise prior's parameters as an autoregressive probabilistic modeling task over spatial patches or tokens. This approach enables NoiseAR to capture complex spatial dependencies and introduce learned structure into the initial state. Crucially, NoiseAR is designed to be conditional, allowing text prompts to directly influence the learned prior, thereby achieving fine-grained control over the diffusion initialization. Our experiments demonstrate that NoiseAR can generate initial noise priors that lead to improved sample quality and enhanced consistency with conditional inputs, offering a powerful, learned alternative to traditional random initialization. A key advantage of NoiseAR is its probabilistic formulation, which naturally supports seamless integration into probabilistic frameworks like Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning.

In this paper, we establish Aesthetic-4K, a meticulously curated dataset containing dedicated training and evaluation subsets specifically designed for comprehensive research on ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. This dataset consists of high-quality 4K images accompanied by descriptive captions generated by GPT-4o. Furthermore, we propose Diffusion-4K, an innovative framework for the direct generation of ultra-high-resolution images. Our approach incorporates the Scale Consistent Variational Auto-Encoder (SC-VAE) and Wavelet-based Latent Fine-tuning (WLF), which are designed for efficient visual token compression and the capture of intricate details in ultra-high-resolution images, thereby facilitating direct training with photorealistic 4K data. This method is applicable to various latent diffusion models and demonstrates its efficacy in synthesizing highly detailed 4K images. Additionally, we propose novel metrics, namely the GLCM Score and Compression Ratio, to assess the texture richness and fine details in local patches, in conjunction with holistic measures such as FID, Aesthetics, and CLIPScore, enabling a thorough and multifaceted evaluation of ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. Consequently, Diffusion-4K achieves impressive performance in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, particularly when powered by state-of-the-art large-scale diffusion models (eg, Flux-12B).

Existing methods typically employ multi-view diffusion models to synthesize multi-view images, followed by a feed-forward process for 3D reconstruction. However, these approaches are often constrained by a small and fixed number of input views, limiting their ability to capture diverse viewpoints and, even worse, leading to suboptimal generation results if the synthesized views are of poor quality. To address these limitations, we propose Flex3D, a novel two-stage framework capable of leveraging an arbitrary number of high-quality input views. The first stage consists of a candidate view generation and curation pipeline. We employ a fine-tuned multi-view image diffusion model and a video diffusion model to generate a pool of candidate views, enabling a rich representation of the target 3D object. Subsequently, a view selection pipeline filters these views based on quality and consistency, ensuring that only the high-quality and reliable views are used for reconstruction. In the second stage, the curated views are fed into a Flexible Reconstruction Model (FlexRM), built upon a transformer architecture that can effectively process an arbitrary number of inputs. FlemRM directly outputs 3D Gaussian points leveraging a tri-plane representation, enabling efficient and detailed 3D generation. Through extensive exploration of design and training strategies, we optimize FlexRM to achieve superior performance in both reconstruction and generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that Flex3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a user study winning rate of over 92% in 3D generation tasks when compared to several of the latest feed-forward 3D generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 25.

Although beneficial in numerous fields, this content presents significant risks, including potential misuse, societal disruptions, and ethical concerns. Consequently, detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs has become crucial, with a marked rise in related research. Despite this, there remains a notable gap in systematic surveys that focus specifically on detecting LAIM-generated multimedia. Addressing this, we provide the first survey to comprehensively cover existing research on detecting multimedia (such as text, images, videos, audio, and multimodal content) created by LAIMs. Specifically, we introduce a novel taxonomy for detection methods, categorized by media modality, and aligned with two perspectives: pure detection (aiming to enhance detection performance) and beyond detection (adding attributes like generalizability, robustness, and interpretability to detectors). Additionally, we have presented a brief overview of generation mechanisms, public datasets, online detection tools, and evaluation metrics to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in this field. Most importantly, we offer a focused analysis from a social media perspective to highlight their broader societal impact. Furthermore, we identify current challenges in detection and propose directions for future research that address unexplored, ongoing, and emerging issues in detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs. Our aim for this survey is to fill an academic gap and contribute to global AI security efforts, helping to ensure the integrity of information in the digital realm.

| **[The Dual Power of Interpretable Token Embeddings: Jailbreaking Attacks and Defenses for Diffusion Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21307v2)** | 2025-06-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.21307v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent studies have shown that they can memorize and create harmful content when given specific text prompts. Although fine-tuning approaches have been developed to mitigate this issue by unlearning harmful concepts, these methods can be easily circumvented through jailbreaking attacks. This implies that the harmful concept has not been fully erased from the model. However, existing jailbreaking attack methods, while effective, lack interpretability regarding why unlearned models still retain the concept, thereby hindering the development of defense strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by proposing an attack method that learns an orthogonal set of interpretable attack token embeddings. The attack token embeddings can be decomposed into human-interpretable textual elements, revealing that unlearned models still retain the target concept through implicit textual components. Furthermore, these attack token embeddings are powerful and transferable across text prompts, initial noises, and unlearned models, emphasizing that unlearned models are more vulnerable than expected. Finally, building on the insights from our interpretable attack, we develop a defense method to protect unlearned models against both our proposed and existing jailbreaking attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack and defense strategies.</p></details> |  |

We address the challenge of mapping natural language instructions and multi-view RGBD observations to quasi-static robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe policies. OG-VLA projects input observations from diverse views into a point cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model (LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5 demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources at https://og-vla.github.io/</p></details> | 17 pages |

Existing methods for motion forecasting or motion generation rely solely on either prior motions or text prompts, facing limitations with precision or control, particularly over extended durations. The multi-modal nature of our approach enhances the contextual understanding of human motion, while our graph-based transformer framework effectively capture both spatial and temporal motion dynamics. As a result, our model consistently outperforms existing generative techniques in accurately predicting long-term motions. Additionally, by leveraging diffusion models' ability to capture different modes of prediction, we estimate uncertainty, significantly improving spatial awareness in human-robot interactions by incorporating zones of presence with varying confidence levels for each body joint.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 - HuMoGen.

Existing approaches address this limitation by retraining the model or introducing external conditioning signals to enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we explore whether a meaningful temporal representation can be extracted directly from the predictions of a pre-trained model without any additional training or auxiliary inputs. We introduce \textbf{FlowMo}, a novel training-free guidance method that enhances motion coherence using only the model's own predictions in each diffusion step. FlowMo first derives an appearance-debiased temporal representation by measuring the distance between latents corresponding to consecutive frames. This highlights the implicit temporal structure predicted by the model. It then estimates motion coherence by measuring the patch-wise variance across the temporal dimension and guides the model to reduce this variance dynamically during sampling. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-video models demonstrate that FlowMo significantly improves motion coherence without sacrificing visual quality or prompt alignment, offering an effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing the temporal fidelity of pre-trained video diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, this paper introduces Neuro-Symbolic Diffusion (NSD), a novel framework that interleaves diffusion steps with symbolic optimization, enabling the generation of certifiably consistent samples under user-defined functional and logic constraints. This key feature is provided for both standard and discrete diffusion models, enabling, for the first time, the generation of both continuous (e.g., images and trajectories) and discrete (e.g., molecular structures and natural language) outputs that comply with constraints. This ability is demonstrated on tasks spanning three key challenges: (1) Safety, in the context of non-toxic molecular generation and collision-free trajectory optimization; (2) Data scarcity, in domains such as drug discovery and materials engineering; and (3) Out-of-domain generalization, where enforcing symbolic constraints allows adaptation beyond the training distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2nd International Conference on Neuro-symbolic Systems (NeuS 2025)</p></details> |

Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some quantity on the goodness of the content. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward, at inference time. We then point out that the improvement of perceptual video quality considering the alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline that we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into lookahead steps for reward estimation over search budget or denoising steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/shim0114/T2V-Diffusion-Search</p></details> |

Creating 3D effects requires specialized expertise and training in 3D animation software and can be time consuming. Generative solutions typically rely on computationally intense methods such as diffusion models which can be slow at 4D inference. We reformulate 3D animation as a field prediction task and introduce a text-driven framework that infers a time-varying 4D flow field acting on 3D Gaussians. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for function generation, our approach interprets arbitrary prompts (e.g., "make the vase glow orange, then explode") and instantly updates color, opacity, and positions of 3D Gaussians in real time. This design avoids overheads such as mesh extraction, manual or physics-based simulations and allows both novice and expert users to animate volumetric scenes with minimal effort on a consumer device even in a web browser. Experimental results show that simple textual instructions suffice to generate compelling time-varying VFX, reducing the manual effort typically required for rigging or advanced modeling. We thus present a fast and accessible pathway to language-driven 3D content creation that can pave the way to democratize VFX further.</p></details> |  |

VFI techniques have evolved from classical motion compensation-based approach to deep learning-based approach, including kernel-, flow-, hybrid-, phase-, GAN-, Transformer-, Mamba-, and more recently diffusion model-based approach. We introduce AceVFI, the most comprehensive survey on VFI to date, covering over 250+ papers across these approaches. We systematically organize and describe VFI methodologies, detailing the core principles, design assumptions, and technical characteristics of each approach. We categorize the learning paradigm of VFI methods namely, Center-Time Frame Interpolation (CTFI) and Arbitrary-Time Frame Interpolation (ATFI). We analyze key challenges of VFI such as large motion, occlusion, lighting variation, and non-linear motion. In addition, we review standard datasets, loss functions, evaluation metrics. We examine applications of VFI including event-based, cartoon, medical image VFI and joint VFI with other LLV tasks.

In this paper, we propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, ensuring the safety of these models remains a significant challenge, particularly in accurately identifying whether multimodal content is safe or unsafe-a capability we term safety awareness. In this paper, we introduce MMSafeAware, the first comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across 29 safety scenarios with 1500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. MMSafeAware includes both unsafe and over-safety subsets to assess models abilities to correctly identify unsafe content and avoid over-sensitivity that can hinder helpfulness. Evaluating nine widely used MLLMs using MMSafeAware reveals that current models are not sufficiently safe and often overly sensitive; for example, GPT-4V misclassifies 36.1% of unsafe inputs as safe and 59.9% of benign inputs as unsafe. We further explore three methods to improve safety awareness-prompting-based approaches, visual contrastive decoding, and vision-centric reasoning fine-tuning-but find that none achieve satisfactory performance. Our findings highlight the profound challenges in developing MLLMs with robust safety awareness, underscoring the need for further research in this area. All the code and data will be publicly available to facilitate future research.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

While this approach achieves impressive performance in several zero-shot tasks, it cannot natively handle multimodal inputs, i.e., encoding image and text into a single feature vector. As a remedy, it is common practice to use additional modules to merge the features extracted by the unimodal encoders. In this work, we present FuseLIP, an alternative architecture for multimodal embedding. Leveraging recent progress in discrete image tokenizers, we propose to use a single transformer model which operates on an extended vocabulary of text and image tokens. This early fusion approach allows the different modalities to interact at each depth of encoding and obtain richer representations compared to common late fusion. We collect new datasets for multimodal pre-training and evaluation, designing challenging tasks for multimodal encoder models. We show that FuseLIP outperforms other approaches in multimodal embedding tasks such as VQA and text-guided image transformation retrieval, while being comparable to baselines on unimodal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models available at https://github.com/chs20/fuselip</p></details> |

Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder. This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations. It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of unannotated driving logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025; Project website: s4-driver.github.io</p></details> |

In addition, AI agents have been specialized for domains such as software engineering, web navigation, and workflow automation. However, this results in agents that are good for one thing but fail to generalize beyond their intended scope. One reason for this is that agent developers provide a highly specialized set of tools or make architectural decisions optimized for a specific use case or benchmark. In this work, we ask the question: what is the minimal set of general tools that can be used to achieve high performance across a diverse set of tasks? Our answer is OpenHands-Versa, a generalist agent built with a modest number of general tools: code editing and execution, web search, as well as multimodal web browsing and file access. Importantly, OpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading specialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench Multimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing previously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1, 1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing state-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target domains. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a generalist agent to solve diverse tasks and establish OpenHands-Versa as a strong baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |

Current deepfake detection methods often depend on datasets with limited generation models and content diversity that fail to keep pace with the evolving complexity and increasing realism of the AI-generated content. Large multimodal models (LMMs), widely adopted in various vision tasks, have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities, yet their potential in deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{DFBench}, a large-scale DeepFake Benchmark featuring (i) broad diversity, including 540,000 images across real, AI-edited, and AI-generated content, (ii) latest model, the fake images are generated by 12 state-of-the-art generation models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both the detection accuracy of deepfake detectors and the evasion capability of generative models.

However, existing visual-question answering benchmarks fall short in evaluating these capabilities of MLLMs due to the lack of paired plain charts and visual-element-based questions. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes 5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying data but differing in visual presentations. We further design visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new opportunities for advancing MLLMs in infographic chart understanding.

However, its effectiveness in multimodal reasoning, a domain more intricate than text-only reasoning, remains underexplored, and the understanding of critical factors in this training paradigm remains limited. Furthermore, a central challenge for this training method is performance saturation, which impedes further improvements and scalability. Inspired by reinforcement learning (RL), in this paper, we reframe self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning through the lens of RL, identifying three pivotal factors: Training Method, Reward Model, and Prompt Variation. Through systematic analysis, we establish relatively optimal design principles that significantly enhance multimodal reasoning capabilities. Moreover, delving deeper into training dynamics, we uncover the roots of saturation and propose a new automatic balancing mechanism to mitigate this limitation. Building on these insights, we propose M-STAR (Multimodal Self-evolving Training for Reasoning), a framework that achieves consistent performance gains across models of varying sizes and diverse benchmarks.

To address this, we introduce \textbf{AbilityLens}, a unified benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in six key perception abilities (ranging from counting, OCR, to understanding structural data), focusing on both accuracy and stability, with each ability encompassing diverse types of questions, domains, and metrics. With the assistance of AbilityLens, we: (1) identify the strengths and weaknesses of current main-stream MLLMs, highlighting stability patterns and revealing a notable performance gap between state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models; (2) uncover interesting ability conflict and early convergence phenomena during MLLM training; (3) reveal the primary reason of ability conflict is data mixing ratio and LLM model size; and (4) discuss the effectiveness of some straightforward strategies \eg, fine-tuning and model merging, to solve the ability conflict.

To address these issues, this paper introduces V2X-UniPool, a unified framework that integrates multimodal Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) data into a time-indexed and language-based knowledge pool. By leveraging a dual-query Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, which enables retrieval of both static and dynamic knowledge, our system enables ADs to perform accurate, temporally consistent reasoning over both static environment and dynamic traffic context. Experiments on a real-world cooperative driving dataset demonstrate that V2X-UniPool significantly enhances motion planning accuracy and reasoning capability. Remarkably, it enables even zero-shot vehicle-side models to achieve state-of-the-art performance by leveraging V2X-UniPool, while simultaneously reducing transmission cost by over 99.9\% compared to prior V2X methods.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing LLM-based graph methods excel in adapting LLMs to text-rich graphs, wherein node attributes are text descriptions. However, their applications to multimodal graphs--where nodes are associated with diverse attribute types, such as texts and images--remain underexplored, despite their ubiquity in real-world scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce the Multimodal Large Language and Graph Assistant (MLaGA), an innovative model that adeptly extends LLM capabilities to facilitate reasoning over complex graph structures and multimodal attributes. We first design a structure-aware multimodal encoder to align textual and visual attributes within a unified space through a joint graph pre-training objective. Subsequently, we implement a multimodal instruction-tuning approach to seamlessly integrate multimodal features and graph structures into the LLM through lightweight projectors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MLaGA compared to leading baseline methods, achieving superior performance in diverse graph learning tasks under both supervised and transfer learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Emotion Cause Explanation in Multimodal Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02430v2)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.02430v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal conversation, a crucial form of human communication, carries rich emotional content, making the exploration of the causes of emotions within it a research endeavor of significant importance. However, existing research on the causes of emotions typically employs an utterance selection method within a single textual modality to locate causal utterances. This approach remains limited to coarse-grained assessments, lacks nuanced explanations of emotional causation, and demonstrates inadequate capability in identifying multimodal emotional triggers. Therefore, we introduce a task-\textbf{Multimodal Emotion Cause Explanation in Conversation (MECEC)}. This task aims to generate a summary based on the multimodal context of conversations, clearly and intuitively describing the reasons that trigger a given emotion. To adapt to this task, we develop a new dataset (ECEM) based on the MELD dataset. ECEM combines video clips with detailed explanations of character emotions, helping to explore the causal factors behind emotional expression in multimodal conversations. A novel approach, FAME-Net, is further proposed, that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze visual data and accurately interpret the emotions conveyed through facial expressions in videos. By exploiting the contagion effect of facial emotions, FAME-Net effectively captures the emotional causes of individuals engaged in conversations. Our experimental results on the newly constructed dataset show that FAME-Net outperforms several excellent baselines. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/3222345200/FAME-Net.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods still encounter significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range, controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in comparison to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{C}r\textbf{o}ss-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{M}odal \textbf{RAG} (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6\% and 9.3\% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.

However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v1)** | 2025-06-03 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.02535v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency via multimodal control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the new large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion models. Leveraging five of the latest digital human generation methods and a voice cloning method, we systematically construct a dataset comprising 60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data diversity and realism. User studies demonstrate that the misrecognition rate by participants for DigiFakeAV reaches as high as 68%. Moreover, the substantial performance degradation of existing detection models on our dataset further highlights its challenges. To address this problem, we propose DigiShield, an effective detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the DigiFakeAV and shows strong generalization on other datasets.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid progress of MLLMs, there is growing interest in applying MLLMs to build general evaluation systems. However, existing work overlooks two aspects: (1) the development of evaluation capabilities for text-to-image (T2I) generation task, and (2) the incorporation of large-scale human evaluation data. In this paper, we introduce Minos-Corpus, a large-scale multimodal evaluation dataset that combines evaluation data from both human and GPT. The corpus contains evaluation data across both image-to-text(I2T) and T2I generation tasks. Based on this corpus, we propose Data Selection and Balance, Mix-SFT training methods, and apply DPO to develop Minos, a multimodal evaluation model built upon a 7B backbone. Minos achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance among all open-source evaluation models of similar scale on the average of evaluation performance on all tasks, and outperforms all open-source and closed-source models on evaluation of T2I generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the importance of leveraging high-quality human evaluation data and jointly training on evaluation data from both I2T and T2I generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in reasoning and retrieval augmented generation have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deep research and generate comprehensive reports. Despite its progress, existing deep research frameworks primarily focus on generating text-only content, leaving the automated generation of interleaved texts and visualizations underexplored. This novel task poses key challenges in designing informative visualizations and effectively integrating them with text reports. To address these challenges, we propose Formal Description of Visualization (FDV), a structured textual representation of charts that enables LLMs to learn from and generate diverse, high-quality visualizations. Building on this representation, we introduce Multimodal DeepResearcher, an agentic framework that decomposes the task into four stages: (1) researching, (2) exemplar report textualization, (3) planning, and (4) multimodal report generation. For the evaluation of generated multimodal reports, we develop MultimodalReportBench, which contains 100 diverse topics served as inputs along with 5 dedicated metrics. Extensive experiments across models and evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness of Multimodal DeepResearcher. Notably, utilizing the same Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, Multimodal DeepResearcher achieves an 82\% overall win rate over the baseline method.</p></details> | 47 pages |

Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.</p></details> |  |

Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive video understanding capabilities, they tend to focus more on the semantic content of videos, often overlooking emotional stimuli. Hence, most existing MLLMs fall short in estimating viewers' emotional reactions and providing plausible explanations. To address this issue, we propose StimuVAR, a spatiotemporal Stimuli-aware framework for Video Affective Reasoning (VAR) with MLLMs. StimuVAR incorporates a two-level stimuli-aware mechanism: frame-level awareness and token-level awareness. Frame-level awareness involves sampling video frames with events that are most likely to evoke viewers' emotions. Token-level awareness performs tube selection in the token space to make the MLLM concentrate on emotion-triggered spatiotemporal regions. Furthermore, we create VAR instruction data to perform affective training, steering MLLMs' reasoning strengths towards emotional focus and thereby enhancing their affective reasoning ability. To thoroughly assess the effectiveness of VAR, we provide a comprehensive evaluation protocol with extensive metrics. StimuVAR is the first MLLM-based method for viewer-centered VAR. Experiments demonstrate its superiority in understanding viewers' emotional responses to videos and providing coherent and insightful explanations.

The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) Vision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of variable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>BZ, K...</summary><p>BZ, KL, ZC, ZH, YY, GC, SL, YJ, HZ, and XL contributed equally to this project.

These breakthroughs are largely driven by new pre-training paradigms that leverage large-scale, unlabeled multimodal data, followed by instruction fine-tuning on curated labeled datasets and high-quality prompts. While there is growing interest in scaling instruction fine-tuning to ever-larger datasets in both quantity and scale, our findings reveal that simply increasing the number of instruction-tuning tasks does not consistently yield better performance. Instead, we observe that grouping tasks by the common interactions across modalities, such as discovering redundant shared information, prioritizing modality selection with unique information, or requiring synergistic fusion to discover new information from both modalities, encourages the models to learn transferrable skills within a group while suppressing interference from mismatched tasks. To this end, we introduce MINT, a simple yet surprisingly effective task-grouping strategy based on the type of multimodal interaction. We demonstrate that the proposed method greatly outperforms existing task grouping baselines for multimodal instruction tuning, striking an effective balance between generalization and specialization.</p></details> |  |

Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge.

However, traditional workflows face several key challenges: (1) reliance on human experts to propose hypotheses, which is time-consuming and prone to confirmation bias; (2) limited interpretability, particularly in deep learning approaches; and (3) underutilization of unstructured data that can encode critical urban context. Given these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approach for interpretable hypothesis inference, enabling the automated generation, evaluation, and refinement of hypotheses concerning urban context and road safety outcomes. Our method leverages MLLMs to craft safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extract interpretable embeddings from their responses, and apply them in regression-based statistical models. UrbanX supports iterative hypothesis testing and refinement, guided by statistical evidence such as coefficient significance, thereby enabling rigorous scientific discovery of previously overlooked correlations between urban design and safety. Experimental evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate that our approach outperforms pretrained deep learning models while offering full interpretability. Beyond road safety, UrbanX can serve as a general-purpose framework for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from unstructured urban data across diverse socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. This approach enhances model trustworthiness for policy applications and establishes a scalable, statistically grounded pathway for interpretable knowledge discovery in urban and transportation studies.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce CogniAlign, a multimodal architecture for Alzheimer's detection that integrates audio and textual modalities, two non-intrusive sources of information that offer complementary insights into cognitive health. Unlike prior approaches that fuse modalities at a coarse level, CogniAlign leverages a word-level temporal alignment strategy that synchronizes audio embeddings with corresponding textual tokens based on transcription timestamps. This alignment supports the development of token-level fusion techniques, enabling more precise cross-modal interactions. To fully exploit this alignment, we propose a Gated Cross-Attention Fusion mechanism, where audio features attend over textual representations, guided by the superior unimodal performance of the text modality. In addition, we incorporate prosodic cues, specifically interword pauses, by inserting pause tokens into the text and generating audio embeddings for silent intervals, further enriching both streams. We evaluate CogniAlign on the ADReSSo dataset, where it achieves an accuracy of 90.36%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. A detailed ablation study confirms the advantages of our alignment strategy, attention-based fusion, and prosodic modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, cross-modal alignment and reasoning introduce unique challenges beyond those in unimodal RAG. This survey offers a structured and comprehensive analysis of Multimodal RAG systems, covering datasets, benchmarks, metrics, evaluation, methodologies, and innovations in retrieval, fusion, augmentation, and generation. We review training strategies, robustness enhancements, loss functions, and agent-based approaches, while also exploring the diverse Multimodal RAG scenarios. In addition, we outline open challenges and future directions to guide research in this evolving field. This survey lays the foundation for developing more capable and reliable AI systems that effectively leverage multimodal dynamic external knowledge bases.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible capabilities in dialogue and reasoning, their ability to understand fine-grained conversational structure, especially in multi-modal, multi-party settings, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a suite of tasks focused on conversational role attribution (speaker, addressees, side-participants) and conversation threading (utterance linking and clustering), drawing on conversation analysis and sociolinguistics. To support those tasks, we present a human annotated dataset of 4,398 annotations for speakers and reply-to relationship, 5,755 addressees, and 3,142 side-participants. We evaluate popular audio-visual LLMs and vision-language models on our dataset, and our experimental results suggest that multimodal conversational structure understanding remains challenging. The most performant audio-visual LLM outperforms all vision-language models across all metrics, especially in speaker and addressee recognition. However, its performance drops significantly when conversation participants are anonymized. The number of conversation participants in a clip is the strongest negative predictor of role-attribution performance, while acoustic clarity (measured by pitch and spectral centroid) and detected face coverage yield positive associations. We hope this work lays the groundwork for future evaluation and development of multimodal LLMs that can reason more effectively about conversation structure.</p></details> |  |

Despite the urgent practical need, developing deep learning techniques suitable to handle such data is limited by the absence of large open-source multi-source real-world datasets of event sequences. To fill this gap, which is mainly caused by security reasons, we present the first industrial-scale publicly available multimodal banking dataset, MBD, that contains information on more than 2M corporate clients of a large bank. Clients are represented by several data sources: 950M bank transactions, 1B geo position events, 5M embeddings of dialogues with technical support, and monthly aggregated purchases of four bank products. All entries are properly anonymized from real proprietary bank data, and the experiments confirm that our anonymization still saves all significant information for introduced downstream tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel multimodal benchmark suggesting several important practical tasks, such as future purchase prediction and modality matching. The benchmark incorporates our MBD and two public financial datasets. We provide numerical results for the state-of-the-art event sequence modeling techniques including large language models and demonstrate the superiority of fusion baselines over single-modal techniques for each task. Thus, MBD provides a valuable resource for future research in financial applications of multimodal event sequence analysis.

In this paper, we present 3MDBench (Medical Multimodal Multi-agent Dialogue Benchmark), an open-source framework for simulating and evaluating LVLM-driven telemedical consultations. 3MDBench simulates patient variability through four temperament-based Patient Agents and an Assessor Agent that jointly evaluate diagnostic accuracy and dialogue quality. It includes 3013 cases across 34 diagnoses drawn from real-world telemedicine interactions, combining textual and image-based data. The experimental study compares diagnostic strategies for popular LVLMs, including GPT-4o-mini, LLaVA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, and Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct. We demonstrate that multimodal dialogue with internal reasoning improves F1 score by 6.5% over non-dialogue settings, highlighting the importance of context-aware, information-seeking questioning. Moreover, injecting predictions from a diagnostic convolutional network into the LVLM's context boosts F1 by up to 20%.

To address this gap, we propose ShapeLLM-Omni-a native 3D large language model capable of understanding and generating 3D assets and text in any sequence. First, we train a 3D vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE), which maps 3D objects into a discrete latent space to achieve efficient and accurate shape representation and reconstruction. Building upon the 3D-aware discrete tokens, we innovatively construct a large-scale continuous training dataset named 3D-Alpaca, encompassing generation, comprehension, and editing, thus providing rich resources for future research and training. Finally, by performing instruction-based training of the Qwen-2.5-vl-7B-Instruct model on the 3D-Alpaca dataset.

To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality without requiring explicit modality generation or auxiliary networks. To efficiently learn these approximations with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning.

In this work, we systematically analyze the impact of sampling frequency across different input modalities - RGB video and 3D hand pose - on egocentric action recognition performance and CPU usage. By exploring a range of configurations, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that reducing the sampling rate of RGB frames, when complemented with higher-frequency 3D hand pose input, can preserve high accuracy while significantly lowering CPU demands. Notably, we observe up to a 3x reduction in CPU usage with minimal to no loss in recognition performance.

However, how representational co-speech gestures refer to objects remains understudied from a computational perspective. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a multimodal reference resolution task centred on representational gestures, while simultaneously tackling the challenge of learning robust gesture embeddings. We propose a self-supervised pre-training approach to gesture representation learning that grounds body movements in spoken language. Our experiments show that the learned embeddings align with expert annotations and have significant predictive power. Moreover, reference resolution accuracy further improves when (1) using multimodal gesture representations, even when speech is unavailable at inference time, and (2) leveraging dialogue history. Overall, our findings highlight the complementary roles of gesture and speech in reference resolution, offering a step towards more naturalistic models of human-machine interaction.</p></details> |  |

Existing reflection methods are simplistic and struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality.</p></details> | Under review |

However, recommendation tasks are inherently constrained to filtering existing items and lack the ability to generate novel concepts, limiting their capacity to fully satisfy user demands and preferences. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that goes beyond content filtering and selecting: directly generating personalized items in a multimodal form, such as images, tailored to individual users. To accomplish this, we leverage any-to-any Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and train them in both supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning strategy to equip them with the ability to yield tailored next items for users. Experiments on two benchmark datasets and user study confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Notably, the generated images not only align well with users' historical preferences but also exhibit relevance to their potential future interests.</p></details> |  |

They often lack inter-frame differencing and tend to average or ignore subtle visual cues. Furthermore, while visual prompting has shown potential in static images, its application to video's temporal complexities, particularly for fine-grained motion understanding, remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether inherent capability can be unlocked and boost MLLMs' motion perception and enable distinct visual signatures tailored to decouple object and camera motion cues. In this study, we introduce MotionSight, a novel zero-shot method pioneering object-centric visual spotlight and motion blur as visual prompts to effectively improve fine-grained motion understanding without training. To convert this into valuable data assets, we curated MotionVid-QA, the first large-scale dataset for fine-grained video motion understanding, with hierarchical annotations including SFT and preference data, {\Theta}(40K) video clips and {\Theta}(87K) QAs. Experiments show MotionSight achieves state-of-the-art open-source performance and competitiveness with commercial models. In particular, for fine-grained motion understanding we present a novel zero-shot technique and a large-scale, high-quality dataset.

In this work, we present EarthMind, a novel vision-language framework for multi-granular and multi-sensor EO data understanding. EarthMind features two core components: (1) Spatial Attention Prompting (SAP), which reallocates attention within the LLM to enhance pixel-level understanding; and (2) Cross-modal Fusion, which aligns heterogeneous modalities into a shared space and adaptively reweighs tokens based on their information density for effective fusion. To facilitate multi-sensor fusion evaluation, we propose EarthMind-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 2,000 human-annotated multi-sensor image-question pairs, covering a wide range of perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EarthMind. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on EarthMind-Bench, surpassing GPT-4o despite being only 4B in scale. Moreover, EarthMind outperforms existing methods on multiple public EO benchmarks, showcasing its potential to handle both multi-granular and multi-sensor challenges in a unified framework.</p></details> |  |

Recently, machine-learning models have emerged as an alternative, though they are currently restricted to discrete gate sets. Here, we introduce a multimodal denoising diffusion model that simultaneously generates a circuit's structure and its continuous parameters for compiling a target unitary. It leverages two independent diffusion processes, one for discrete gate selection and one for parameter prediction. We benchmark the model over different experiments, analyzing the method's accuracy across varying qubit counts, circuit depths, and proportions of parameterized gates. Finally, by exploiting its rapid circuit generation, we create large datasets of circuits for particular operations and use these to extract valuable heuristics that can help us discover new insights into quantum circuit synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Text: 10 pages and 5 figures; Appendix: 17 pages, 7 figures and 1 table.

We introduce Zoom-Refine, a novel training-free method that enhances MLLM capabilities to address this issue. Zoom-Refine operates through a synergistic process of \textit{Localized Zoom} and \textit{Self-Refinement}. In the \textit{Localized Zoom} step, Zoom-Refine leverages the MLLM to provide a preliminary response to an input query and identifies the most task-relevant image region by predicting its bounding box coordinates. During the \textit{Self-Refinement} step, Zoom-Refine then integrates fine-grained details from the high-resolution crop (identified by \textit{Localized Zoom}) with its initial reasoning to re-evaluate and refine its preliminary response. Our method harnesses the MLLM's inherent capabilities for spatial localization, contextual reasoning and comparative analysis without requiring additional training or external experts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Zoom-Refine on two challenging high-resolution multimodal benchmarks.

However, MLAs introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs, long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy. We utilize websites and mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets. Large-scale experiments involving 13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance, proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains; the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting in unpredictable derived risks. Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse interactive environments.</p></details> |  |

Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%.

Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation.The former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural understanding but fall short by 10\% to human experts, while open VLMs lags further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of only 42\%.

Despite excellent alignment results, these multimodal frameworks still cannot be directly applied to compelling movie storytelling involving multiple scenes, where "on-screen" sounds require temporally-aligned audio generation, while "off-screen" sounds contribute to appropriate environment sounds accompanied by background music when applicable. Inspired by professional movie production, this paper proposes a multi-agentic framework for audio generation supervised by an autonomous Sound Director agent, engaging multi-turn conversations with other agents for on-screen and off-screen sound generation through multimodal LLM. To address on-screen sound generation, after detecting any talking humans in videos, we capture semantically and temporally synchronized sound by training a prediction model that forecasts interpretable, time-varying audio control signals: loudness, pitch, and timbre, which are used by a Foley Artist agent to condition a cross-attention module in the sound generation. The Foley Artist works cooperatively with the Composer and Voice Actor agents, and together they autonomously generate off-screen sound to complement the overall production. Each agent takes on specific roles similar to those of a movie production team. To temporally ground audio language models, in ReelWave, text/video conditions are decomposed into atomic, specific sound generation instructions synchronized with visuals when applicable. Consequently, our framework can generate rich and relevant audio content conditioned on video clips extracted from movies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vincent2311.github.io/ReelWave_demo</p></details> |

Despite the long-standing vision of automating this process with "one click", existing tools remain largely rule-based and lack generalizable, generative capabilities. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled promising agents for GUI-related tasks in general-purpose scenarios. However, they struggle with the unique challenges of form filling, such as flexible layouts and the difficulty of aligning textual instructions with on-screen fields. To bridge this gap, we formally define the form-filling task and propose FormFactory, an interactive benchmarking suite comprising a web-based interface, backend evaluation module, and carefully constructed dataset. Our benchmark covers diverse real-world scenarios, incorporates various field formats, and simulates high-fidelity form interactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe that no model surpasses 5% accuracy, underscoring the inherent difficulty of the task. These findings also reveal significant limitations in current models' visual layout reasoning and field-value alignment abilities. We hope our benchmark can serve as a stepping stone for further research into robust, practical form-filling agents.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

In real-world scenarios, practical factors often lead to uncertain modality missingness. Existing methods for handling modality missingness are based on data reconstruction or common subspace projections. However, these methods neglect the confidence in multimodal combinations and impose constraints on intra-class representation, hindering the capture of modality-specific information and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that effectively incorporates multimodal probabilistic embeddings via a mixture of Student's $t$-distributions, enhancing its robustness by incorporating confidence and accommodating heavy-tailed properties. This strategy estimates joint distributions with uncertainty scores and reduces uncertainty in the student network by consistency distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a reparameterization representation module that facilitates CASD in robust multimodal learning by sampling embeddings from the joint distribution for the prediction module to calculate the task loss. As a result, the directional constraint from the loss minimization is alleviated by the sampled representation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, there has been insufficient discussion and exploration regarding the selection and encoding of genetic information. Secondly, due to the significantly superior classification value of AD imaging features compared to genetic features, many studies in multimodal fusion emphasize the strengths of imaging features, actively mitigating the influence of weaker features, thereby diminishing the learning of the unique value of genetic features. To address this issue, this study proposes the dynamic multimodal role-swapping network (GenDMR). In GenDMR, we develop a novel approach to encode the spatial organization of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enhancing the representation of their genomic context. Additionally, to adaptively quantify the disease risk of SNPs and brain region, we propose a multi-instance attention module to enhance model interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a dominant modality selection module and a contrastive self-distillation module, combining them to achieve a dynamic teacher-student role exchange mechanism based on dominant and auxiliary modalities for bidirectional co-updating of different modal data. Finally, GenDMR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ADNI public dataset and visualizes attention to different SNPs, focusing on confirming 12 potential high-risk genes related to AD, including the most classic APOE and recently highlighted significant risk genes. This demonstrates GenDMR's interpretable analytical capability in exploring AD genetic features, providing new insights and perspectives for the development of multimodal data fusion techniques.</p></details> | 31 pages, 9 figures |

However, they perform inadequately when handling complex visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. We establish a benchmark called Human Pose and Action Understanding Benchmark (HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and evaluate it on the benchmark, achieving significant improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 21.18% compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models.

However, the adversarial robustness of these models, especially in the alignment of image-text features, has not yet been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we introduce a novel gradient-based multimodal adversarial attack method, underpinned by contrastive learning, to improve the transferability of multimodal adversarial samples in VLP models. This method concurrently generates adversarial texts and images within imperceptive perturbation, employing both image-text and intra-modal contrastive loss. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on image-text retrieval and visual entailment tasks, using publicly available datasets in a black-box setting. Extensive experiments indicate a significant advancement over existing single-modal transfer-based adversarial attack methods and current multimodal adversarial attack approaches.</p></details> |  |

This process often involves extensive field surveys, manual data collection, and subjective assessments, which can be time-consuming, costly, and sometimes inconsistent. Street View Images (SVIs), along with deep learning methods, provide a way to realize large-scale urban safety detection. However, achieving this goal often requires extensive human annotation to train safety ranking models, and the architectural differences between cities hinder the transferability of these models. Thus, a fully automated method for conducting safety evaluations is essential. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated powerful reasoning and analytical capabilities. Cutting-edge models, e.g., GPT-4 have shown surprising performance in many tasks. We employed these models for urban safety ranking on a human-annotated anchor set and validated that the results from MLLMs align closely with human perceptions. Additionally, we proposed a method based on the pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) feature and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) retrieval to quickly assess the safety index of the entire city. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing training needed deep learning approaches, achieving efficient and accurate urban safety evaluations. The proposed automation for urban safety perception assessment is a valuable tool for city planners, policymakers, and researchers aiming to improve urban environments.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Despite advancements, the undesirable generation of these models remains a critical concern, particularly due to vulnerabilities exposed by text-based jailbreak attacks, which have represented a significant threat by challenging existing safety protocols. Motivated by the unique security risks posed by the integration of new and old modalities for MLLMs, we propose a unified multimodal universal jailbreak attack framework that leverages iterative image-text interactions and transfer-based strategy to generate a universal adversarial suffix and image. Our work not only highlights the interaction of image-text modalities can be used as a critical vulnerability but also validates that multimodal universal jailbreak attacks can bring higher-quality undesirable generations across different MLLMs. We evaluate the undesirable context generation of MLLMs like LLaVA, Yi-VL, MiniGPT4, MiniGPT-v2, and InstructBLIP, and reveal significant multimodal safety alignment issues, highlighting the inadequacy of current safety mechanisms against sophisticated multimodal attacks. This study underscores the urgent need for robust safety measures in MLLMs, advocating for a comprehensive review and enhancement of security protocols to mitigate potential risks associated with multimodal capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, existing computational ToM methods rely on structured workflows with ToM-specific priors or deep model fine-tuning, which struggle with scalability in multimodal environments and fail to generalize as task complexity increases. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian ToM planner that decomposes ToM reasoning into stepwise Bayesian updates. Our framework introduces weak-to-strong control, allowing smaller language models (LMs) to specialize in ToM-specific likelihood estimation and transfer their reasoning behaviors to larger LMs (7B to 405B) for integration with social and world knowledge. This synergistic approach aligns large-model inference of human mental states with Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 4.6% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art techniques on multimodal ToM benchmarks, including challenging unseen scenarios, thereby establishing a new standard for modeling human mental states in complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Spotlight at the 2025 Forty-Second International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks fail to adequately distinguish between perception-induced hallucinations and reasoning-induced hallucinations. This failure constitutes a significant issue and hinders the diagnosis of multimodal reasoning failures within MLLMs. To address this, we propose the {\dataset} benchmark, which isolates reasoning hallucinations by constructing questions where input images are correctly perceived by MLLMs yet reasoning errors persist. {\dataset} introduces multi-granular evaluation metrics: accuracy, factuality, and LLMs hallucination score for hallucination quantification. Our analysis reveals that (1) the model scale, data scale, and training stages significantly affect the degree of logical, fabrication, and factual hallucinations; (2) current MLLMs show no effective improvement on spatial hallucinations caused by misinterpreted spatial relationships, indicating their limited visual reasoning capabilities; and (3) question types correlate with distinct hallucination patterns, highlighting targeted challenges and potential mitigation strategies. To address these challenges, we propose {\method}, a method that combines curriculum reinforcement fine-tuning to encourage models to generate logic-consistent reasoning chains by stepwise reducing learning difficulty, and collaborative hint inference to reduce reasoning complexity. {\method} establishes a baseline on {\dataset}, and reduces the logical hallucinations in original base models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce GeoLocSFT, a framework that demonstrates how targeted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a large multimodal foundation model (Gemma 3) using a small, high-quality dataset can yield highly competitive geolocation performance. GeoLocSFT is trained with only 2700 carefully selected image-GPS pairs from our geographically diverse MR600k dataset. Despite this limited data, our SFT-centric approach substantially improves over baseline models and achieves robust results on standard benchmarks such as Im2GPS-3k and YFCC-4k, as well as on our newly proposed and challenging MR40k benchmark, aimed specifically at sparsely populated regions. Further, we explore multi-candidate inference and aggregation strategies but find that the core gains are already realized at the SFT stage. Our findings highlight the power of high-quality supervision and efficient SFT for planet-scale image geolocation, especially when compared to prior methods that require massive databases or complex pipelines.

The comparison was made using physiological signals (blood volume pulse (BVP) and electrodermal activity (EDA)) collected from individuals during an experimental study. In addition, we also collected responses of individuals using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) survey. Furthermore, we mapped the collected physiological signals to the responses of participants for NASA TLX to predict their workload. For both the classification problems, we compare the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Results show that for our CNN-based approach using multimodal data (both BVP and EDA) gave better results than using just BVP (approx. 8.38% more) and EDA (approx 20.49% more). Our LSTM-based model too had better results when we used multimodal data (approx 8.38% more than just BVP and 6.70% more than just EDA). Overall, CNNs performed better than LSTMs for classifying physiologies for paper vs robot-based instruction by 7.72%.

Drawing inspiration from human auditory perception, which adeptly integrates cross-modal cues and performs sophisticated auditory scene analysis, we introduce a novel two-stage automated pipeline. This pipeline first employs specialized pretrained models to extract diverse contextual cues (e.g., speech, music, general sounds, and visual information from associated video). A large language model (LLM) then synthesizes these rich, multimodal inputs to generate detailed and context-aware audio captions. Key contributions of this work include: (1) the proposed scalable method for fine-grained audio caption generation; (2) FusionAudio, a new large-scale dataset comprising 1.2 million such detailed captions, combined with 6 million QA pairs; and (3) enhanced audio models developed using FusionAudio, specifically a CLAP-based audio encoder with superior audio-text alignment and instruction following.

Previous works generally assume that all visual tokens are necessary in the shallow layers of LLMs, and therefore token compression typically occurs in intermediate layers. In contrast, our study reveals an interesting insight: with proper selection, token compression is feasible at the input stage of LLM with negligible performance loss. Specifically, we reveal that explainability methods can effectively evaluate the importance of each visual token with respect to the given instruction, which can well guide the token compression. Furthermore, we propose to learn a mapping from the attention map of the first LLM layer to the explanation results, thereby avoiding the need for a full inference pass and facilitating practical deployment. Interestingly, this mapping can be learned using a simple and lightweight convolutional network, whose training is efficient and independent of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on 10 image and video benchmarks across three leading MLLMs (Qwen2-VL, LLaVA-OneVision, and VILA1.5) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, e.g., pruning 50% visual tokens while retaining more than 96% of the original performance across all benchmarks for all these three MLLMs. It also exhibits strong generalization, even when the number of tokens in inference far exceeds that used in training.</p></details> |  |

This challenge stems from two key issues: first, incorporating spatial-temporal localization introduces a vast number of coordinate combinations, complicating the alignment of linguistic and visual coordinate representations; second, encoding fine-grained temporal and spatial information during video feature compression is inherently difficult. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-ST, a MLLM for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. In LLaVA-ST, we propose Language-Aligned Positional Embedding, which embeds the textual coordinate special token into the visual space, simplifying the alignment of fine-grained spatial-temporal correspondences. Additionally, we design the Spatial-Temporal Packer, which decouples the feature compression of temporal and spatial resolutions into two distinct point-to-region attention processing streams. Furthermore, we propose ST-Align dataset with 4.3M training samples for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. With ST-align, we present a progressive training pipeline that aligns the visual and textual feature through sequential coarse-to-fine stages.Additionally, we introduce an ST-Align benchmark to evaluate spatial-temporal interleaved fine-grained understanding tasks, which include Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) , Event Localization and Captioning (ELC) and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG). LLaVA-ST achieves outstanding performance on 11 benchmarks requiring fine-grained temporal, spatial, or spatial-temporal interleaving multimodal understanding.

This shortfall stems from their predominant reliance on logic- and knowledge-based slow thinking strategies, while effective for domains like math and science, fail to integrate visual information effectively during reasoning. Consequently, these models often fail to adequately ground visual cues, resulting in suboptimal performance in tasks that require multiple plausible visual interpretations and inferences. To address this, we present GThinker (General Thinker), a novel reasoning MLLM excelling in multimodal reasoning across general scenarios, mathematics, and science. GThinker introduces Cue-Rethinking, a flexible reasoning pattern that grounds inferences in visual cues and iteratively reinterprets these cues to resolve inconsistencies. Building on this pattern, we further propose a two-stage training pipeline, including pattern-guided cold start and incentive reinforcement learning, designed to enable multimodal reasoning capabilities across domains. Furthermore, to support the training, we construct GThinker-11K, comprising 7K high-quality, iteratively-annotated reasoning paths and 4K curated reinforcement learning samples, filling the data gap toward general multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GThinker achieves 81.5% on the challenging comprehensive multimodal reasoning benchmark M$^3$CoT, surpassing the latest O4-mini model. It also shows an average improvement of 2.1% on general scenario multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining on-par performance in mathematical reasoning compared to counterpart advanced reasoning models.

We present NavBench, a benchmark to evaluate the embodied navigation capabilities of MLLMs under zero-shot settings. NavBench consists of two components: (1) navigation comprehension, assessed through three cognitively grounded tasks including global instruction alignment, temporal progress estimation, and local observation-action reasoning, covering 3,200 question-answer pairs; and (2) step-by-step execution in 432 episodes across 72 indoor scenes, stratified by spatial, cognitive, and execution complexity. To support real-world deployment, we introduce a pipeline that converts MLLMs' outputs into robotic actions. We evaluate both proprietary and open-source models, finding that GPT-4o performs well across tasks, while lighter open-source models succeed in simpler cases. Results also show that models with higher comprehension scores tend to achieve better execution performance. Providing map-based context improves decision accuracy, especially in medium-difficulty scenarios.

Notably, we introduce the first benchmark GaslightingBench, specifically designed to evaluate the vulnerability of MLLMs to negation arguments. GaslightingBench consists of multiple-choice questions curated from existing datasets, along with generated negation prompts across 20 diverse categories.

This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative models for this task, MDETR and GLIP.

We propose a label encoder-guided MER framework based on CLIP (MER-CLIP) to learn emotion-related representations across modalities. Our approach introduces a label encoder that treats labels as text embeddings to incorporate their semantic information, leading to the learning of more representative emotional features. To further exploit label semantics, we devise a cross-modal decoder that aligns each modality to a shared embedding space by sequentially fusing modality features based on emotion-related input from the label encoder.

To address these, we propose a gated interactive attention mechanism to adaptively extract modality-specific features while enhancing emotional information through pairwise interactions. Additionally, we introduce a modality-invariant generator to learn modality-invariant representations and constrain domain shifts by aligning cross-modal similarities. Experiments on IEMOCAP demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MER approaches, achieving WA 80.7% and UA 81.3%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

These efforts typically start with contrastive learning and gradually extend to the disentanglement of modal information, achieving solid multimodal discrete unified representations. However, existing research often overlooks two critical issues: 1) The use of Euclidean distance for quantization in discrete representations often overlooks the important distinctions among different dimensions of features, resulting in redundant representations after quantization; 2) Different modalities have unique characteristics, and a uniform alignment approach does not fully exploit these traits. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Optimization of Codebook (TOC) and Fine and Coarse cross-modal Information Disentangling (FCID). These methods refine the unified discrete representations from pretraining and perform fine- and coarse-grained information disentanglement tailored to the specific characteristics of each modality, achieving significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models.

Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion. Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Exploration identifies promising attraction basins, while exploitation finds the best solutions within these basins. The balance between exploration and exploitation can be maintained by adjusting parameter settings. The population size adaptation covariance matrix adaption evolutionary strategy algorithm (PSA-CMA-ES) achieves this balance by dynamically adjusting population size. PSA-CMA-ES performs well on well-structured multimodal benchmark problems. In weakly structured multimodal problems, however, the algorithm struggles to effectively manage step-size increases, resulting in uncontrolled step-size blow-ups that impede convergence near the global optimum. In this study, we reformulated the step-size correction strategy to overcome this limitation. We analytically identified the cause of the step-size blow-up and demonstrate the existence of a significance level for population size change guiding a safe passage to step-size correction. These insights were incorporated to form the reformulation. Through computer experiments on two weakly structured multimodal benchmark problems, we evaluated the performance of the new approach and compared the results with the state-of-the-art algorithm. The improved algorithm successfully mitigates step-size blow-up, enabling a better balance between exploration and exploitation near the global optimum enhancing convergence.</p></details> |  |

Yet, two key challenges remain: (1) the lack of a standardized, pretrained representation for tabular data, as is commonly available in vision and language domains; and (2) the difficulty of handling missing values in the tabular modality, which are common in real-world medical datasets. To address these issues, we propose the TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal Engine (TIME), a novel multimodal framework that builds on the recently introduced tabular foundation model, TabPFN. TIME leverages TabPFN as a frozen tabular encoder to generate robust, strong embeddings that are naturally resilient to missing data, and combines them with image features from pretrained vision backbones. We explore a range of fusion strategies and tabular encoders, and evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIME consistently outperforms competitive baselines across both complete and incomplete tabular inputs, underscoring its practical value in real-world multimodal learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, reproducible benchmarks with sufficient spatiotemporal depth and contextual richness for long horizon prediction remain scarce. To address this, we introduce HouseTS a large scale, multimodal dataset covering monthly house prices from March 2012 to December 2023 across 6,000 ZIP codes in 30 major U.S. metropolitan areas. The dataset includes over 890K records, enriched with points of Interest (POI), socioeconomic indicators, and detailed real estate metrics. To establish standardized performance baselines, we evaluate 14 models, spanning classical statistical approaches, deep neural networks (DNNs), and pretrained time-series foundation models. We further demonstrate the value of HouseTS in a multimodal case study, where a vision language model extracts structured textual descriptions of geographic change from time stamped satellite imagery. This enables interpretable, grounded insights into urban evolution. HouseTS is hosted on Kaggle, while all preprocessing pipelines, benchmark code, and documentation are openly maintained on GitHub to ensure full reproducibility and easy adoption.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.</p></details> |  |

However, a pressing issue arises: Can the safety risk principles designed and aligned for general MLLMs in dialogue scenarios be effectively transferred to real-world computer-use scenarios? Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for computer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark designed to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world computer manipulations. Our benchmark includes 492 risky tasks spanning various computer applications, involving web, social media, multimedia, os, email, and office software. We categorize these risks into two major classes based on their risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks. For the evaluation, we evaluate safety risks from two perspectives: (i) Risk goal intention and (ii) Risk goal completion. Extensive experiments with multimodal agents on \textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents confront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios. Our findings highlight the necessity and urgency of safety alignment for computer-use agents in real-world computer manipulation, providing valuable insights for developing trustworthy computer-use agents.

Assessing Amplified Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21523v2)** | 2025-05-31 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.21523v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a multimodal cognition and embodied decision-making brain system, ``Wenlu", designed to enable secure fusion of private knowledge and public models, unified processing of multimodal data such as images and speech, and closed-loop decision-making from cognition to automatic generation of hardware-level code. The system introduces a brain-inspired memory tagging and replay mechanism, seamlessly integrating user-private data, industry-specific knowledge, and general-purpose language models. It provides precise and efficient multimodal services for enterprise decision support, medical analysis, autonomous driving, robotic control, and more. Compared with existing solutions, ``Wenlu" demonstrates significant advantages in multimodal processing, privacy security, end-to-end hardware control code generation, self-learning, and sustainable updates, thus laying a solid foundation for constructing the next-generation intelligent core.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic pilot studies, we uncover the significant potential of ULMs to enable the synergistic co-evolution of dual capabilities within a shared policy optimization framework. Building on this insight, we introduce CoRL, a co-reinforcement learning framework comprising a unified RL stage for joint optimization and a refined RL stage for task-specific enhancement. With the proposed CoRL, our resulting model, ULM-R1, achieves average improvements of 7% on three text-to-image generation datasets and 23% on nine multimodal understanding benchmarks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRL and highlight the substantial benefit of reinforcement learning in facilitating cross-task synergy and optimization for ULMs. Code is available at https://github.com/mm-vl/ULM-R1.</p></details> |  |

However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, we exploit the capabilities of MLLMs to interpret non-textual instructions, specifically, adversarial images or audio generated by our novel method, Con Instruction. We optimize these adversarial examples to align closely with target instructions in the embedding space, revealing the detrimental implications of MLLMs' sophisticated understanding. Unlike prior work, our method does not require training data or preprocessing of textual instructions. While these non-textual adversarial examples can effectively bypass MLLM safety mechanisms, their combination with various text inputs substantially amplifies attack success. We further introduce a new Attack Response Categorization (ARC) framework, which evaluates both the quality of the model's response and its relevance to the malicious instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that Con Instruction effectively bypasses safety mechanisms in multiple vision- and audio-language models, including LLaVA-v1.5, InternVL, Qwen-VL, and Qwen-Audio, evaluated on two standard benchmarks: AdvBench and SafeBench. Specifically, our method achieves the highest attack success rates, reaching 81.3% and 86.6% on LLaVA-v1.5 (13B). On the defense side, we explore various countermeasures against our attacks and uncover a substantial performance gap among existing techniques. Our implementation is made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Current research suggests that multi-task training outperforms single-task as different tasks can benefit each other, but they often overlook the internal relationships within these tasks. To analyze this phenomenon, we attempted to employ compositional generalization (CG), which refers to the models' ability to understand novel combinations by recombining learned elements, as a guiding framework. Since medical images can be precisely defined by Modality, Anatomical area, and Task, naturally providing an environment for exploring CG, we assembled 106 medical datasets to create Med-MAT for comprehensive experiments. The experiments confirmed that MLLMs can use CG to understand unseen medical images and identified CG as one of the main drivers of the generalization observed in multi-task training. Additionally, further studies demonstrated that CG effectively supports datasets with limited data and confirmed that MLLMs can achieve CG across classification and detection tasks, underscoring its broader generalization potential.

To address this, we explore the potential of Japanese PDF data as a training resource, an area that remains largely underutilized. We introduce a fully automated pipeline that leverages pretrained models to extract image-text pairs from PDFs through layout analysis, OCR, and vision-language pairing, removing the need for manual annotation. Additionally, we construct instruction data from extracted image-text pairs to enrich the training data. To evaluate the effectiveness of PDF-derived data, we train Japanese LMMs and assess their performance on the Japanese LMM Benchmark. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements, with performance gains ranging from 2.1% to 13.8% on Heron-Bench.

In this paper, we propose Global Label Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) for multimodal fake news detection, which integrates LLM capabilities via label propagation techniques. The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not propagate their own labels back to themselves.

Existing approaches often rely on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LoRA framework to preserve previous instruction alignments. However, these methods are prone to Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), as they aggregate all LoRA blocks via simple summation, which compromises performance over time. In this paper, we identify a critical parameter inefficiency in the MoELoRA framework within the MCIT context. Based on this insight, we propose BranchLoRA, an asymmetric framework to enhance both efficiency and performance. To mitigate CF, we introduce a flexible tuning-freezing mechanism within BranchLoRA, enabling branches to specialize in intra-task knowledge while fostering inter-task collaboration. Moreover, we incrementally incorporate task-specific routers to ensure an optimal branch distribution over time, rather than favoring the most recent task. To streamline inference, we introduce a task selector that automatically routes test inputs to the appropriate router without requiring task identity.

Existing evaluation metrics usually use the reference set as the evaluation basis, which inevitably leads to reference set dependence. To optimize this problem, this study proposes an evaluation metric based on a Regionalized Metric Framework. The algorithm divides the set of solutions to be evaluated into three regions, and evaluates each solution according to a unique scoring function for each region, which is combined to form the evaluation value of the solution set. To verify the feasibility of this method, a comparative experiment was conducted in this study. The results of the experiment are roughly the same as the trend of existing indicators, and at the same time, it can accurately judge the advantages and disadvantages of points equidistant from the reference set.

So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears", namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots with "eyes and ears" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset, Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model, trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and respond appropriately.

To study this issue, we introduce an automated framework, augmented with human-in-the-loop quality control, to generate inputs designed to simulate and evaluate these conflicts in MLLMs. Using this framework, we have crafted a diagnostic benchmark consisting of 374 original images and 1,122 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs. The benchmark covers two aspects of conflict and three question types, providing a thorough assessment tool. We apply this benchmark to assess the conflict-resolution capabilities of nine representative MLLMs from various model families. Our results indicate an evident over-reliance on parametric knowledge for approximately 20% of all queries, especially among Yes-No and action-related problems. Based on these findings, we evaluate the effectiveness of existing approaches to mitigating the conflicts and compare them to our "Focus-on-Vision" prompting strategy. Despite some improvement, the vision-knowledge conflict remains unresolved and can be further scaled through our data construction framework. Our proposed framework, benchmark, and analysis contribute to the understanding and mitigation of vision-knowledge conflicts in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 main</p></details> |

This approach has been extended to multimodal LLMs, where the models can produce chain-of-thoughts (CoT) about the content of input images and videos. In this work, we propose to obtain video LLMs whose reasoning steps are grounded in, and explicitly refer to, the relevant video frames. For this, we first create CoF-Data, a large dataset of diverse questions, answers, and corresponding frame-grounded reasoning traces about both natural and synthetic videos, spanning various topics and tasks. Then, we fine-tune existing video LLMs on this chain-of-frames (CoF) data. Our approach is simple and self-contained, and, unlike existing approaches for video CoT, does not require auxiliary networks to select or caption relevant frames. We show that our models based on CoF are able to generate chain-of-thoughts that accurately refer to the key frames to answer the given question. This, in turn, leads to improved performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks, for example, surpassing leading video LLMs on Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, and notably reducing the hallucination rate.

MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction, and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision. Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible, versatile materials science datasets.

No-reference image quality measures are often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and code are publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388429.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v4)** | 2025-03-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.19097v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, as well as in the development stage of machine learning algorithms that operate on medical images. The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subspace accelerated measure transport methods for fast and scalable sequential experimental design, with application to photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20086v1)** | 2025-02-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.20086v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach for sequential optimal experimental design (sOED) for Bayesian inverse problems involving expensive models with large-dimensional unknown parameters. The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guidance-base Diffusion Models for Improving Photoacoustic Image Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06354v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06354v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic(PA) imaging is a non-destructive and non-invasive technology for visualizing minute blood vessel structures in the body using ultrasonic sensors. In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Free-hand 3D Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Reconstruction using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03505v1)** | 2025-02-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.03505v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a motion-based learning network with a global-local self-attention module (MoGLo-Net) to enhance 3D reconstruction in handheld photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging. Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact: Self-incentive artifact removal for photoacoustic imaging without any data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14873v2)** | 2024-12-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.14873v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) uniquely combines optical contrast with the penetration depth of ultrasound, making it critical for clinical applications. However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v4)** | 2024-12-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.19224v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[4D SlingBAG: spatial-temporal coupled Gaussian ball for large-scale dynamic 3D photoacoustic iterative reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03898v1)** | 2024-12-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.03898v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale dynamic three-dimensional (3D) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is significantly important in clinical applications. In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging Systems: The Bayesian Cram√©r-Rao Bound Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09557v1)** | 2024-10-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.09557v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution imaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and blood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images.

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |
